Doors were split and smashed off their hinges; walls were dented in the shape of fists, phones, and",
  "1": "flowerpots; Herbal was hiding in a hotel room scared for his life; and Mystery was collapsed on the living room carpet cry\u00ad ing. He'd been crying for two days straight. This wasn't a normal kind of crying. Ordinary tears are understand\u00ad able. But Mystery was beyond understanding. He was out of control. For a week, he'd been vacillating between periods of extreme anger and violence, and jags of fitful, cathartic sobbing. And now he was threatening to kill himself. There were five of us living in the house: Herbal, Mystery, Papa, Play\u00ad boy, and me. Boys and men came from every corner of the globe to shake our hands, take photos with us, learn from us, be us. They called me Style. It was a name I had earned. We never used our real names\u2014only our aliases. Even our mansion, like the others we had spawned everywhere from San Francisco to Sydney, had a nickname. It was Project Hollywood. And Project Hollywood was in shambles. The sofas and dozens of throw pillows lining the floor of the sunken living room were fetid and discolored with the sweat of men and the juices of women. The white carpet had gone gray from the constant traffic of young, perfumed humanity herded in off Sunset Boulevard every night. Cigarette butts and used condoms floated grimly in the Jacuzzi. And Mys\u00ad tery's rampage during the last few days had left the rest of the place totaled and the residents petrified. He was six foot five and hysterical. \"I can't tell you what this feels like,\" he choked out between sobs. His whole body spasmed. \"I don't know what I'm going to do, but it will not be rational.\" Page 16 4 He reached up from the floor and punched the stained red upholstery of the sofa as the siren-wail of his despondency grew louder, filling the room with the sound of a grown male who has lost every characteristic that separates man from infant from animal. He wore a gold silk robe that was several sizes too small, exposing his scabbed knees. The ends of the sash just barely met to form a knot and the curtains of the robe hung half a foot apart, revealing a pale, hairless chest and, below it, saggy gray Calvin Klein boxer shorts. The only other item of clothing on his trembling body was a winter cap pulled tight over his skull. It was June in Los Angeles. \"This living thing.\" He was speaking again. \"It's so pointless.\" He turned and looked at me through wet, red eyes. \"It's Tic Tac Toe. There's no way you can win. So the best thing to do is not to play it.\" There was no one else in the house. I would have to deal with this. He needed to be sedated before he snapped out of tears and back into anger. Each cycle of emotions grew worse, and this time I was afraid he'd do some\u00ad thing that couldn't be undone. I couldn't let Mystery die on my watch. He was more than just a friend; he was a mentor. He'd changed my life, as he had the lives of thousands of others just like me. I needed to get him Valium, Xanax, Vicodin, anything. I grabbed my phone book and scanned the pages for people most likely to have pills\u2014people like guys in rock bands, women who'd just had plastic surgery, former child actors. But everyone I called wasn't home, didn't have any drugs, or claimed not to have any drugs because they didn't want to share. There was only one person left to call: the woman who had triggered Mystery's downward spiral. She was a party girl; she must have something. Katya, a petite Russian blonde with a Smurfette voice and the energy of a Pomeranian puppy, was at the front door in ten minutes with a Xanax and a worried look on her face. \"Do not come in,\" I warned her. \"He'll probably kill you.\" Not that she didn't entirely deserve it, of course. Or so I thought at the time. I gave Mystery the pill and a glass of water, and waited until the sobs slowed to a sniffle. Then I helped him into a pair of black boots, jeans, and a gray T-shirt. He was docile now, like a big baby. \"I'm taking you to get some help,\" I told him. I walked him outside to my old rusty Corvette and",
  "2": "stuffed him into the Page 17 5 tiny front seat. Every now and then, I'd see a tremor of anger flash across his face or tears roll out of his eyes. I hoped he'd remain calm long enough for me to help him. \"I want to learn martial arts,\" he said docilely, \"so when I want to kill someone, I can do something about it.\" I stepped on the accelerator. Our destination was the Hollywood Mental Health Center on Vine Street. It was an ugly slab of concrete surrounded day and night by home\u00ad less men who screamed at lampposts, transvestites who lived out of shop\u00ad ping carts, and other remaindered human beings who set up camp where free social services could be found. Mystery, I realized, was one of them. He just happened to have charisma and talent, which drew others to him and prevented him from ever being left alone in the world. He possessed two traits I'd noticed in nearly every rock star I'd ever interviewed: a crazy, driven gleam in his eyes and an absolute inability to do anything for himself. I brought him into the lobby, signed him in, and together we waited for a turn with one of the counselors. He sat in a cheap black plastic chair, star\u00ad ing catatonically at the institutional blue walls. An hour passed. He began to fidget. Two hours passed. His brow furrowed; his face clouded. Three hours passed. The tears started. Four hours passed. He bolted out of his chair and ran out of the wait\u00ad ing room and through the front door of the building. He walked briskly, like a man who knew where he was going, although Project Hollywood was three miles away. I chased him across the street and caught up to him outside a mini-mall. I took his arm and turned him around, baby talking him back into the waiting room. Five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. Thirty. He was up and out again. I ran after him. Two social workers stood uselessly in the lobby. \"Stop him! \"I yelled. \"We can't,\" one of them said. \"He's left the premises.\" \"So you're just going to let a suicidal man walk out of here?\" I couldn't waste time arguing. \"Just have a therapist ready to see him if I get him back here.\" I ran out the door and looked to my right. He wasn't there. I looked Page 18 6 left. Nothing. I ran north to Fountain Avenue, spotted him around the cor\u00ad ner, and dragged him back again. When we arrived, the social workers led him down a long, dark hallway and into a claustrophobic cubicle with a sheet-vinyl floor. The therapist sat behind a desk, running a finger through a black tangle in her hair. She was a slim Asian woman in her late twenties, with high cheekbones, dark red lip\u00ad stick, and a pinstriped pantsuit. Mystery slumped in a chair across from her. \"So how are you feeling today?\" she asked, forcing a smile. \"I'm feeling,\" Mystery said, \"like there's no point to anything.\" He burst into tears. \"I'm listening,\" she said, scrawling a note on her pad. The case was probably already closed for her. \"So I'm removing myself from the gene pool,\" he sobbed. She looked at him with feigned sympathy as he continued. To her, he was just one of a dozen nutjobs she saw a day. All she needed to figure out was whether he required medication or institutionalization. \"I can't go on,\" Mystery went on. \"It's futile.\" With a rote gesture, she reached into a drawer, pulled out a small pack\u00ad age of tissues, and handed it to him. As Mystery reached for the package, he looked up and met her eyes for the first time. He froze and stared at her silently. She was surprisingly cute for a clinic like this. A flicker of animation flashed across Mystery's face, then died. \"If I had met you in another time and another place,\" he said, crumpling a tissue in his hands, \"things would have been different.\" His body, normally proud and erect, curved like soggy macaroni in his chair. He stared glumly at the floor as he spoke. \"I know exactly what to say and what to do to make you attracted to me,\" he continued. \"It's all in my head. Every rule. Every step. Every word. I just can't... do it",
  "3": "right now.\" She nodded mechanically. \"You should see me when I'm not like this,\" he continued slowly, snif\u00ad fling. \"I've dated some of the most beautiful women in the world. Another place, another time, and I would have made you mine.\" \"Yes,\" she said, patronizing him. \"I'm sure you would have.\" She didn't know. How could she? But this sobbing giant with the crumpled tissue in his hands was the greatest pickup artist in the world. That was not a matter of opinion, but fact. I'd met scores of the self- Page 19 7 proclaimed best in the previous two years, and Mystery could out-game them all. It was his hobby, his passion, his calling. There was only one person alive who could possibly compete with him. And that man was sitting in front of her also. From a formless lump of nerd, Mystery had molded me into a superstar. Together, we had ruled the world of seduction. We had pulled off spectacular pickups before the disbe\u00ad lieving eyes of our students and disciples in Los Angeles, New York, Mon\u00ad treal, London, Melbourne, Belgrade, Odessa, and beyond. And now we were in a madhouse. Page 20 MEET STYLE I am far from attractive. My nose is too large for my face and, while not hooked, has a bump in the ridge. Though I am not bald, to say that my hair is thinning would be an understatement. There are just wispy Rogaine\u00ad enhanced growths covering the top of my head like tumbleweeds. In my opinion, my eyes are small and beady, though they do have a lively glimmer, which is doomed to remain my secret because no one can see it behind my glasses. I have indentations on either side of my forehead, which I like and believe add character to my face, though I've never actually been compli\u00ad mented on them. I am shorter than I'd like to be and so skinny that I look malnourished to most people, no matter how much I eat. When I look down at my pale, slouched body, I wonder why any woman would want to sleep next to it, let alone embrace it. So, for me, meeting girls takes work. I'm not the kind of guy women giggle over at a bar or want to take home when they're feeling drunk and crazy. I can't offer them a piece of my fame and bragging rights like a rock star or cocaine and a mansion like so many other men in Los An\u00ad geles. All I have is my mind, and nobody can see that. You may notice that I haven't mentioned my personality. This is be\u00ad cause my personality has completely changed. Or, to put it more accurately, I completely changed my personality. I invented Style, my alter ego. And in the course of two years, Style became more popular than I ever was\u2014 especially with women. It was never my intention to change my personality or walk through the world under an assumed identity. In fact, I was happy with myself and my life. That is, until an innocent phone call (it always starts with an innocent phone call) led me on a journey into one of the oddest and most exciting un\u00ad derground communities that, in more than a dozen years of journalism, I have ever come across. The call was from Jeremie Ruby-Strauss (no relation), a book editor who had stumbled across a document on the Internet called Page 21 9 the lay guide, short for The How-to-Lay-Girls Guide. Compressed into 150 siz\u00ad zling pages, he said, was the collected wisdom of dozens of pickup artists who have been exchanging their knowledge in newsgroups for nearly a de\u00ad cade, secretly working to turn the art of seduction into an exact science. The information needed to be rewritten and organized into a coherent how-to book, and he thought I was the man to do it. I wasn't so sure. I want to write literature, not give advice to horny ado\u00ad lescents. But, of course, I told him it wouldn't hurt to take a look at it. The moment I started reading, my life changed. More than any other book or document\u2014be it the Bible, Crime and Punishment, or The Joy of Cooking\u2014the lay guide opened my eyes. And not necessarily because of the information in it, but because of the path it sent me hurtling down. When I look back on",
  "4": "my teenage years, I have one major regret, and it has nothing to do with not studying hard enough, not being nice to my mother, or crashing my father's car into a public bus. It is simply that I didn't fool around with enough girls. I am a deep man\u2014I reread James Joyce's Ulysses every three years for fun. I consider myself reasonably intu\u00ad itive. I am at the core a good person, and I try to avoid hurting others. But I can't seem to evolve to the next state of being because I spend far too much time thinking about women. And I know I'm not alone. When I first met Hugh Hefner, he was seventy-three. He had slept with over a thousand of the most beautiful women in the world, by his own account, but all he wanted to talk about were his three girlfriends\u2014Mandy, Brandy, and Sandy. And how, thanks to Viagra, he could keep them all satisfied (though his money probably satis\u00ad fied them enough). If he ever wanted to sleep with somebody else, he said, the rule was that they'd all do it together. So what I gathered from the con\u00ad versation was that here was a guy who's had all the sex he wanted his whole life and, at seventy-three, he's still chasing tail. When does it stop? If Hugh Hefner isn't over it yet, when am I going to be? If the lay guide had never crossed my path, I, like most men, would never have evolved in my thinking about the opposite sex. In fact, I probably started off worse than most men. In my preteen years, there were no games of doctor, no girls who charged a dollar to look up their skirts, no tickling classmates in places I wasn't supposed to touch. I spent most of teenage life grounded, so when my sole adolescent sexual opportunity arose\u2014a drunken freshman girl called and offered me a blow job\u2014I was forced to decline, or else suffer my mother's wrath. In college I began to find myself: the things I was interested Page 22 10 in, the personality I'd always been too shy to express, the group of friends who would expand my mind with drugs and conversation (in that order). But I never became comfortable around women: They intimidated me. In four years of college, I did not sleep with a single woman on campus. After school I took a job at the New York Times as a cultural reporter, where I began to build confidence in myself and my opinions. Eventually, I gained access to a privileged world where no rules applied: I went on the road with Marilyn Manson and Motley Crue to write books with them. In all that time, with all those backstage passes, I didn't get so much as a single kiss from anyone except Tommy Lee. After that, I pretty much gave up hope. Some guys had it; other guys didn't. I clearly didn't. The problem wasn't that I'd never been laid. It was that the few times I did get lucky, I'd turn a one-night stand into a two-year stand because I didn't know when it was going to happen again. The layguide had an acronym for people like me: AFC\u2014average frustrated chump. I was an AFC. Not like Dustin. I met Dustin the year I graduated from college. He was friends with a classmate of mine named Marko, a faux-aristocratic Serbian who had been my companion in girllessness since nursery school, thanks largely to his head, which was shaped like a watermelon. Dustin wasn't any taller, richer, more famous, or better looking than either of us. But he did possess one quality we didn't: He attracted women. When Marko first introduced me to him, I was unimpressed. He was short and swarthy with long curly brown hair and a cheesy button-down gigolo shirt with too many buttons undone. That night, we went to a Chicago club called Drink. As we checked our coats, Dustin asked, \"Do you know if there are any dark corners in here?\" I asked him what he needed dark corners for, and he replied that they were good places to take girls. I raised my eyebrows skeptically. Minutes af\u00ad ter entering the bar, however, he made eye contact with a shy-looking girl who was talking with a friend. Without a word, Dustin walked away. The girl followed",
  "5": "him\u2014straight to a dark corner. When they finished kissing and groping, they parted wordlessly, without an obligatory exchange of phone numbers or even a sheepish see-you-later. Dustin repeated this seemingly miraculous feat four times that night. A new world opened up before my eyes. I grilled him for hours, trying to determine what sort of magical powers he possessed. Dustin was what they call a natural. He had lost his virginity Page 23 11 at age eleven, when the fifteen-year-old daughter of a neighbor used him as a sexual experiment, and he had been fucking nonstop since. One night, I took him to a party on a boat anchored in New York's Hudson River. When a sultry brown-haired, doe-eyed girl walked by, he turned to me and said, \" She's just your type.\" I denied it and stared at the floor, as usual. I was afraid he'd try to make me talk to her, which he soon did. When she walked past again, he asked her, \"Do you know Neil?\" It was a stupid icebreaker, but it didn't matter now that the ice was bro\u00ad ken. I stammered out a few words, until Dustin took over and rescued me. We met her and her boyfriend at a bar afterward. They had just moved in to\u00ad gether. Her boyfriend was taking their dog for a walk. After a few drinks, he took the dog home, leaving the girl, Paula, with us. Dustin suggested going back to my place to cook a late-night snack, so we walked to my tiny East Village apartment and, instead, collapsed on the bed, with Dustin on one side of Paula and me on the other. When Dustin started kissing her left cheek, he signaled me to do the same on her right cheek. Then, in synchronicity, we moved down her body to her neck and her breasts. Though I was surprised by Paula's quiet compliance, for Dustin this seemed to be business as usual. He turned to me and asked if I had a condom. I found one for him. He pulled off her pants and moved into her while I continued lapping uselessly at her right breast. That was Dustin's gift, his power: giving women the fantasy they never thought they'd experience. Afterward, Paula called me constantly. She wanted to talk about the experience all the time, to rationalize it, because she couldn't believe what she had done. That's how it always worked with Dustin: He got the girl; I got the guilt. I chalked this up to a simple difference of personality. Dustin had a natural charm and animal instinct that I just didn't. Or at least that's what I thought, until I read the layguide and explored the newsgroups and web\u00ad sites it recommended. What I discovered was an entire community filled with Dustins\u2014men who claimed to have found the combination to unlock a woman's heart and legs\u2014along with thousands of others like myself, try\u00ad ing to learn their secrets. The difference was that these men had broken down their methods to a specific set of rules that anybody could apply. And each self-proclaimed pickup artist had his own set of rules. There was Mystery, a magician; Ross Jeffries, a hypnotist; Rick H., a mil\u00ad lionaire entrepreneur; David DeAngelo, a real estate agent; Juggler, a stand- Page 24 12 up comedian; David X, a construction worker; and Steve P., a seductionist so powerful that women actually pay to learn how to give him better head. Put them on South Beach in Miami and any number of better-looking, muscle- bound bullies will be kicking sand in their pale, emaciated faces. But put them in a Starbucks or Whiskey Bar, and they'll be taking turns making out with that bully's girlfriend as soon as his back is turned. Once I discovered their world, the first thing that changed was my vo\u00ad cabulary. Terms like AFC, PUA (pickup artist), sarging (picking up women), and HB (hot babe)1 entered my permanent lexicon. Then my daily rituals changed as I became addicted to the online locker room these pickup artists had created. Whenever I returned home from meeting or going out with a woman, I sat down at my computer and posted my questions of the night on the newsgroups. \"What do I do if she says she has",
  "6": "a boyfriend?\"; \"If she eats garlic during dinner, does it mean she isn't planning on kissing me?\"; \"Is it a good or a bad sign when a girl puts on lipstick in front of me?\" And online characters like Candor, Gunwitch, and Formhandle began replying to my questions. (The answers, in order: use a boyfriend-destroyer pattern; you're overanalyzing this; neither.) Soon I realized this was not just an Internet phenomenon but a way of life. There were cults of wanna-be se\u00ad ductionists in dozens of cities\u2014from Los Angeles to London to Zagreb to Bombay\u2014who met weekly in what they called lairs to discuss tactics and strategies before going out en masse to meet women. In the guise of Jeremie Ruby-Strauss and the Internet, God had given me a second chance. It wasn't too late to be Dustin, to become what every woman wants\u2014not what she says she wants, but what she really wants, deep inside, beyond her social programming, where her fantasies and day\u00ad dreams lie. But I couldn't do it on my own. Talking to guys online was not going to be enough to change a lifetime of failure. I had to meet the faces behind the screen names, watch them in the field, find out who they were and what made them tick. I made it my mission\u2014my full-time job and obsession\u2014to hunt down the greatest pickup artists in the world and beg for shelter un\u00ad der their wings. And so began the strangest two years of my life. A glossary has been provided on page 439 with detailed explanations of these and other terms used by the seduction community. Page 25 STEP 2 APPROACH AND OPEN Page 26 THE FIRST PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US, MEN AND WOMEN, IS NOT TO LEARN, BUT TO UNLEARN. \u2014 GLORIA STEINEM, commencement speech, Vnssar (College Page 27 I withdrew five hundred dollars from the bank, stuffed it into a white enve\u00ad lope, and wrote Mystery on the front. It was not the proudest moment of my life. But I had dedicated the last four days to getting ready for it anyway- buying two hundred dollars worth of clothing at Fred Segal, spending an afternoon shopping for the perfect cologne, and dropping seventy-five bucks on a Hollywood haircut. I wanted to look my best; this would be my first time hanging out with a real pickup artist. His name, or at least the name he used online, was Mystery. He was the most worshipped pickup artist in the community, a powerhouse who spit out long, detailed posts that read like algorithms of how to manipu\u00ad late social situations to meet and attract women. His nights out seducing models and strippers in his hometown of Toronto were chronicled in inti\u00ad mate detail online, the writing filled with jargon of his own invention: sniper negs, shotgun negs, group theory, indicators of interest, pawning\u2014 all of which had become an integral part of the pickup artist lexicon. For four years, he had been offering free advice in seduction newsgroups. Then, in October, he decided to put a price on himself and posted the fob lowing: Mystery is now producing Basic Training workshops in several cities around the world, due to numerous requests. The first workshop will be in LosAnge\u00ad lesfrom Wednesday evening, October 10, through Saturday night. The fee is $500 (U.S.). This includes club entry, limo for four evenings (sweet huh?), an hour lecture in the limo each evening with a thirty-minute debriefing at the end of the night, and finally three-and-a-half hours per night in the field (broken up into two clubs per night) with Mystery. By the end of Basic Training, you will have approached close to fifty women. It is no easy feat to sign up for a workshop dedicated to picking up women. To do so is to acknowledge defeat, inferiority, and inadequacy. It is Page 28 16 to finally admit to yourself that after all these years of being sexually active (or at least sexually cognizant), you have not grown up and figured it out. Those who ask for help are often those who have failed to do something for themselves. So if drug addicts go to rehab and the violent go to anger man\u00ad agement class, then",
  "7": "social retards go to pickup school. Clicking send on my e-mail to Mystery was one of the hardest things I'd ever done. If anyone\u2014friends, family, colleagues, and especially my lone ex-girlfriend in Los Angeles\u2014found out I was paying for live in-field lessons on picking up women, the mockery and recrimination would be instant and merciless. So I kept my intentions secret, dodging social plans by telling people that I was going to be showing an old friend around town all weekend. I would have to keep these two worlds separate. In my e-mail to Mystery, I didn't tell him my last name or my occupa\u00ad tion. If pressed, I planned to just say I was a writer and leave it at that. I wanted to move through this subculture anonymously, without either an advantage or extra pressure because of my credentials. However, I still had my own conscience to deal with. This was, far and away, the most pathetic thing I'd ever done in my life. And unfortunately\u2014 as opposed to, say, masturbating in the shower\u2014it wasn't something I could do alone. Mystery and the other students would be there to bear witness to my shame, my secret, my inadequacy. A man has two primary drives in early adulthood: one toward power, success, and accomplishment; the other toward love, companionship, and sex. Half of life then was out of order. To go before them was to stand up as a man and admit that I was only half a man. Page 29 A week after sending the e-mail, I walked into the lobby of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. I wore a blue wool sweater that was so soft and thin it looked like cotton, black pants with laces running up the sides, and shoes that gave me a couple extra inches in height. My pockets bulged with the supplies Mystery had instructed every student to bring: a pen, a notepad, a pack of gum, and condoms. I spotted Mystery instantly. He was seated regally in a Victorian arm\u00ad chair, with a smug, I-just-bench-pressed-the-world smile on his face. He wore a casual, loose-fitting blue-black suit; a small, pointed labret piercing wagged from his chin; and his nails were painted jet black. He wasn't nec\u00ad essarily attractive, but he was charismatic\u2014tall and thin, with long chest\u00ad nut hair, high cheekbones, and a bloodless pallor. He looked like a computer geek who'd been bitten by a vampire and was midway through his transformation. Next to him was a shorter, intense-looking character who introduced himself as Mystery's wing, Sin. He wore a form-fitting black crew neck shirt, and his hair was pitch black and gelled straight back. He had the complex\u00ad ion, however, of a man whose natural hair color is red. I was the first student to arrive. \"What's your top score?\" Sin leaned in and asked as I sat down. They were already assessing me, trying to figure out if I was in possession of a thing called game. \"My top score?\" \"Yeah, how many girls have you been with?\" \"Urn, somewhere around seven,\" I told them. \"Somewhere around seven?\" Sin pressed. \"Six,\" I confessed. Sin ranked in the sixties, Mystery in the hundreds. I looked at them in wonder: These were the pickup artists whose exploits I'd been following so avidly online for months. They were another class of being: They had the magic pill, the solution to the inertia and frustration that has plagued the Page 30 18 great literary protagonists I'd related to all my life\u2014be it Leopold Bloom, Alex Portaoy, or Piglet from Winnie the Pooh. As we waited for the other students, Mystery threw a manila envelope full of photographs in my lap. \"These are some of the women I've dated,\" he said. In the folder was a spectacular array of beautiful women: a headshot of a sultry Japanese actress; an autographed publicity still of a brunette who bore an uncanny resemblance to Liv Tyler; a glossy picture of a. Penthouse Pet of the Year; a snapshot of a tan, curvy stripper in a negligee who Mystery said was his girlfriend, Patricia; and a photo of a brunette with large silicone breasts, which were being suckled by Mystery in the middle of a",
  "8": "nightclub. These were his credentials. \"I was able to do that by not paying attention to her breasts all night,\" he explained when I asked about the last shot. \"A pickup artist must be the exception to the rule. You must not do what everyone else does. Ever.\" I listened carefully. I wanted to make sure every word etched itself on my cerebral cortex. I was attending a significant event; the only other credi\u00ad ble pickup artist teaching courses was Ross Jeffries, who had basically founded the community in the late 1980s. But today marked the first time seduction students would be removed from the safe environs of the semi\u00ad nar room and let loose in clubs to be critiqued as they ran game on unsus\u00ad pecting women. A second student arrived, introducing himself as Extramask. He was a tall, gangly, impish twenty-six-year-old with a bowl cut, overly baggy cloth\u00ad ing, and a handsomely chiseled face. With the right haircut and outfit, he would easily have been a good-looking guy. When Sin asked him what his count was, Extramask scratched his head uncomfortably. \"I have virtually zero experience with girls,\" he explained. \"I've never kissed a girl before.\" \"You're kidding,\" Sin said. \"I've never even held a girl's hand. I grew up pretty sheltered. My par\u00ad ents were really strict Catholics, so I always had a lot of guilt about girls. But I've had three girlfriends.\" He looked at the floor and rubbed his knees in nervous circles as he listed his girlfriends, though no one had asked for the particulars. There was Mitzelle, who broke up with him after seven days. There was Claire, who told him after two days that she'd made a mistake when she agreed to go out with him. Page 31 19 \"And then there was Carolina, my sweet Carolina,\" he said, a dreamy smile spreading across his face. \"We were a couple for one day. I remember her walking over to my house the next afternoon with her friend. I saw her across the street, and I was excited to see her. When I got closer, she yelled, 'I'm dumping you.'\" All of these relationships apparently took place in sixth grade. Extra- mask shook his head sadly. It was hard to tell whether he was consciously being funny or not. The next arrival was a tanned, balding man in his forties who'd flown in from Australia just to attend the workshop. He had a ten-thousand-dollar Rolex, a charming accent, and one of the ugliest sweaters I'd ever seen\u2014a thick cable-knit monstrosity with multi-colored zigzags that looked like the aftermath of a finger-painting mishap. He reeked of money and confi\u00ad dence. Yet the moment he opened his mouth to give Sin his score (five), he betrayed himself. His voice trembled; he couldn't look anyone in the eye; and there was something pathetic and childlike about him. His appearance, like his sweater, was just an accident that spoke nothing of his nature. He was new to the community and reluctant to share even his first name, so Mystery christened him Sweater. The three of us were the only students in the workshop. \"Okay, we've got a lot to talk about,\" Mystery said, clapping his hands together. He leaned in close, so the other guests in the hotel couldn't hear. \"My job here is to get you into the game,\" he continued, making pierc\u00ad ing eye contact with each of us. \"I need to get what's in my head into yours. Think of tonight as a video game. It is not real. Every time you do an ap\u00ad proach, you are playing this game.\" My heart began pounding violently. The thought of trying to start a conversation with a woman I didn't know petrified me, especially with these guys watching and judging me. Bungee jumping and parachuting were a Cakewalk compared to this. \"All your emotions are going to try to fuck you up,\" Mystery continued. \"They are there to try to confuse you, so know right now that they cannot be trusted at all. You will feel shy sometimes, and self-conscious, and you must deal with it like you deal with a pebble in your shoe. It's uncomfort\u00ad able, but you ignore it. It's not part of the",
  "9": "equation.\" I looked around; Extramask and Sweater seemed just as nervous as I was. \"I need to teach you, in four days, the whole equation\u2014the sequence of Page 32 20 moves you need to win,\" Mystery went on. \"And you will have to play the game over and over to learn how to win. So get ready to fail.\" Mystery paused to order a Sprite with five slices of lemon on the side, then told us his story. He spoke in a loud, clear voice\u2014modeled, he said, on the motivational speaker Anthony Robbins. Everything about him seemed to be a conscious, rehearsed invention. Since the age of eleven, when he beat the secret to a card trick out of a classmate, Mystery's goal in life was to become a celebrity magician, like David Copperfield. He spent years studying and practicing, and managed to parlay his talents into birthday parties, corporate gigs, and even a couple of talk shows. In the process, however, his social life suffered. At the age of twenty-one, when he was still a virgin, he decided to do something about it. \"One of the world's greatest mysteries is the mind of a woman,\" he told us grandiosely. \"So I set out to solve it.\" He took a half hour bus ride into Toronto every day, going to bars, clothing stores, restaurants, and coffee shops. He wasn't aware of the online community or any other pickup artists, so he was forced to work alone, rely\u00ad ing on the one skill he did know: magic. It took him dozens of trips to the city before he even worked up the guts to talk to a stranger. From there, he tolerated failure, rejection, and embarrassment day and night until, piece by piece, he put together the puzzle that is social dynamics and discovered what he believed to be the patterns underlying all male-female relationships. \"It took me ten years to discover this,\" he said. \"The basic format is FMAC\u2014find, meet, attract, close. Believe it or not, the game is linear. A lot of people don't know that.\" For the next half hour, Mystery told us about what he called group the\u00ad ory. \"I have done this specific set of events a bazillion times,\" he said. \"You do not walk up to a girl who's all by herself. That is not the perfect seduc\u00ad tion. Women of beauty are rarely found alone.\" After approaching the group, he continued, the key is to ignore the woman you desire while winning over her friends\u2014especially the men and anyone else likely to cockblock. If the target is attractive and used to men fawning all over her, the pickup artist must intrigue her by pretending to be unaffected by her charm. This is accomplished through the use of what he called a neg. Neither compliment nor insult, a neg is something in between\u2014an ac\u00ad cidental insult or backhanded compliment. The purpose of a neg is to lower Page 33 21 a woman's self esteem while actively displaying a lack of interest in her\u2014by telling her she has lipstick on her teeth, for example, or offering her a piece of gum after she speaks. \"I don't alienate ugly girls; I don't alienate guys. I only alienate the girls I want to fuck,\" Mystery lectured, eyes blazing with the conviction of his aphorisms. \"If you don't believe me, you will see it tonight. Tonight is the night of experiments. First, I am going to prove myself. You are going to watch me and then we are going to push you to try a few sets. Tomorrow, if you do what I say, you will be able to make out with a girl within fifteen minutes.\" He looked at Extramask. \"Name the five characteristics of an alpha male.\" \"Confidence?\" \"Right. What else?\" \"Strength?\" \"No.\" \"Body odor?\" He turned to Sweater and me. We were also clueless. \"The number one characteristic of an alpha male is the smile,\" he said, beaming an artificial beam. \"Smile when you enter a room. As soon as you walk in a club, the game is on. And by smiling, you look like you're together, you're fun, and you're somebody.\" He gestured to Sweater. \"When you came in, you didn't smile when you talked to us.\" \"That's just not me,\" Sweater said. \"I look silly when I smile.\" \"If you keep doing what",
  "10": "you've always done, you'll keep getting what you've always gotten. It's called the Mystery Method because I'm Mystery and it's my method. So what I'm going to ask is that you indulge in some of my suggestions and try new things over the next four days. You are going to see a difference.\" Besides confidence and a smile, we learned, the other characteristics of an alpha male were being well-groomed, possessing a sense of humor, con\u00ad necting with people, and being seen as the social center of a room. No one bothered to tell Mystery that those were actually six characteristics. As Mystery dissected the alpha male further, I realized something: The reason I was here\u2014the reason Sweater and Extramask were also here\u2014was that our parents and our friends had failed us. They had never given us the Page 34 22 tools we needed to become fully effective social beings. Now, decades later, it was time to acquire them. Mystery went around the table and looked at each of us. \"What kind of girls do you want?\" he asked Sweater. Sweater pulled a piece of neatly folded notebook paper out of his pocket. \"Last night I wrote down a list of goals for myself,\" he said, unfold\u00ad ing the page, which was filled with four columns of numbered items. \"And one of the things I'm looking for is a wife. She needs to be smart enough to hold up her end of any conversation and have enough style and beauty to turn heads when she walks into a room.\" \"Well, look at you,\" Mystery said. \"You look average. People think if they look generic, then they can seduce a wide array of women. Not true. You have to specialize. If you look average, you're going to get average girls. Your khaki pants are for the office. They're not for clubs. And your sweater\u2014burn it. You need to be bigger than life. I'm talking over the top. If you want to get the 10s, you need to learn peacock theory.\" Mystery loved theories. Peacock theory is the idea that in order to at\u00ad tract the most desirable female of the species, it's necessary to stand out in a flashy and colorful way. For humans, he told us, the equivalent of the fanned peacock tail is a shiny shirt, a garish hat, and jewelry that lights up in the dark\u2014basically, everything I'd dismissed my whole life as cheesy. When it came time for my personal critique, Mystery had a laundry list of fixes: get rid of the glasses, shape the overgrown goatee, shave the expen\u00ad sively trimmed tumbleweeds on my head, dress more outrageously, wear a conversation piece, get some jewelry, get a life. I wrote down every word of advice. This was a guy who thought about seduction nonstop, like a mad scientist working on a formula to turn peanuts into gasoline. The archive of his Internet messages was 3,000 posts long\u2014more than 2,500 pages\u2014all dedicated to cracking the code that is woman. \"I have an opener for you to use,\" he said to me. An opener is a prepared script used to start a conversation with a group of strangers; it's the first thing anyone who wants to meet women must be armed with. \"Say this when you see a group with a girl you like. 'Hey, it looks like the party's over here.' Then turn to the girl you want and add, 'If I wasn't gay, you'd be so mine.'\" A flash of crimson burned up my face. \"Really?\" I asked. \"How is that going to help?\" Page 35 23 \"Once she's attracted to you, it won't matter whether you said you were gay or not.\" \"But isn't that lying?\" \"It's not lying,\" he replied. \"It's flirting.\" To the group, he offered other examples of openers: innocent but in\u00ad triguing questions like \"Do you think magic spells work?\" or \"Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?\" Sure, they weren't that spec\u00ad tacular or sophisticated, but all they are meant to do is get two strangers talking. The point of Mystery Method, he explained, is to come in under the radar. Don't approach a woman with a sexual come-on. Learn about her first and let her earn the right to be hit on. \"An amateur hits on a woman right away,\" he decreed as he rose to leave the",
  "11": "hotel. \"A pro waits eight to ten minutes.\" Armed with our negs, group theory, and camouflage openers, we were ready to hit the clubs. Page 36 We piled into the limo and drove to the Standard Lounge, a velvet-rope- guarded hotel hotspot. It was here that Mystery shattered my model of real\u00ad ity. Limits I had once imposed on human interaction were extended far beyond what I ever thought possible. The man was a machine. The Standard was dead when we walked in. We were too early. There were just two groups of people in the room: a couple near the entrance and two couples in the corner. I was ready to leave. But then I saw Mystery approach the people in the corner. They were sitting on opposite couches across a glass table. The men were on one side. One of them was Scott Baio, the actor best known for playing Chachi on Happy Days. Across from him were two women, a brunette and a bleached blonde who looked like she'd stepped out of the pages of Maxim. Her cut-off white T-shirt was suspended so high into the air by fake breasts that the bottom of it just hovered, flapping in the air above a belly tightened by fastidious exercise. This woman was Baio's date. She was also, I gathered, Mystery's target. His intentions were clear because he wasn't talking to her. Instead, he had his back turned to her and was showing something to Scott Baio and his friend, a well-dressed, well-tanned thirty-something who looked as if he smelled strongly of aftershave. I moved in closer. \"Be careful with that,\" Baio was saying. \"It cost forty-thousand dollars.\" Mystery had Baio's watch in his hands. He placed it carefully on the table. \"Now watch this,\" he commanded. \"I tense my stomach muscles, in\u00ad creasing the flow of oxygen to my brain, and....\" As Mystery waved his hands over the watch, the second hand stopped ticking. He waited fifteen seconds, then waved his hands again, and slowly the watch sputtered back to life\u2014along with Baio's heart. Mystery's audi\u00ad ence of four burst into applause. \"Do something else!\" the blonde pleaded. Mystery brushed her off with a neg. \"Wow, she's so demanding,\" he said, turning to Baio. \"Is she always like this?\" Page 37 25 We were witnessing group theory in action. The more Mystery per\u00ad formed for the guys, the more the blonde clamored for attention. And every time, he pushed her away and continued talking with his two new friends. \"I don't usually go out,\" Baio was telling Mystery. \"I'm over it, and I'm too old.\" After a few more minutes, Mystery finally acknowledged the blonde. He held his arms out. She placed her hands in his, and he began giving her a psychic reading. He was employing a technique I'd heard about called cold reading: the art of telling people truisms about themselves without any prior knowledge of their personality or background. In the field, all knowledge\u2014however esoteric\u2014is power. With each accurate sentence Mystery spoke, the blonde's jaw dropped further open, until she started asking him about his job and his psychic abilities. Every response Mystery gave was intended to accentuate his youth and enthusiasm for the good life Baio said he had outgrown. \"I feel so old,\" Mystery said, baiting her. \"How old are you?\" she asked. \"Twenty-seven.\" \"That's not old. That's perfect.\" He was in. Mystery called me over and whispered in my ear. He wanted me to talk to Baio and his friend, to keep them occupied while he hit on the girl. This was my first experience as a wing\u2014a term Mystery had taken from Top Gun, along with words like target and obstacle. I struggled to make small talk with them. But Baio, looking nervously at Mystery and his date, cut me off. \"Tell me this is all an illusion,\" he said, \"and he's not actually stealing my girlfriend.\" Ten long minutes later, Mystery stood up, put his arm around me, and we left the club. Outside, he pulled a cocktail napkin from his jacket pocket. It contained her phone number. \"Did you get a good look at her?\" Mystery asked. \" That is what I'm in the game for.",
  "12": "Everything I've learned I used to\u00ad night. It's all led up to this moment. And it worked.\" He beamed with self- satisfaction. \"How's that for a demonstration?\" That was all it took. Stealing a girl right from under a celebrity's nose- has-been or not\u2014was a feat even Dustin couldn't have accomplished. Mys\u00ad tery was the real deal. As we took the limo to the Key Club, Mystery told us the first command- Page 38 26 ment of pickup: the three-second rule. A man has three seconds after spotting a woman to speak to her, he said. If he takes any longer, then not only is the girl likely to think he's a creep who's been staring at her for too long, but he will start overthinking the approach, get nervous, and probably blow it. The moment we walked into the Key Club, Mystery put the three- second rule into action. Striding up to a group of women, he held out his hands and asked, \"What's your first impression of these? Not the big hands, the black nails.\" As the girls gathered around him, Sin pulled me aside and suggested wandering the club and attempting my first approach. A group of women walked by and I tried to say something. But the word \"hi\" just barely squeaked out of my throat, not even loud enough for them to hear. As they continued past, I followed and grabbed one of the girls on the shoulder from behind. She turned around, startled, and gave me the withering what- a-creep look that was the whole reason I was too scared to talk to women in the first place. \"Never,\" Sin admonished me in his adenoidal voice, \"approach a woman from behind. Always come in from the front, but at a slight angle so it's not too direct and confrontational. You should speak to her over your shoulder, so it looks like you might walk away at any minute. Ever see Robert Redford in The Horse Whisperer? It's kind of like that.\" A few minutes later, I spotted a young, tipsy-looking woman with long, tangled blonde curls and a puffy pink vest standing alone. I decided that approaching her would be an easy way to redeem myself I circled around until I was in the ten o'clock position in front of her and walked in, imagin\u00ad ing myself approaching a horse I didn't want to frighten. \"Oh my God,\" I said to her. \"Did you see those two girls fighting out\u00ad side?\" \"No,\" she said. \"What happened?\" She was interested. She was talking to me. It was working. \"Um, two girls were fighting over this little guy who was half their size. It was pretty brutal. He was just standing there laughing as the police came and arrested the girls.\" She giggled. We started talking about the club and the band playing there. She was very friendly and actually seemed grateful for the conversa\u00ad tion. I had no idea that approaching a woman could be this easy. Sin sidled up to me and whispered in my ear, \"Go kino.\" Page 39 27 \"What's kino?\" I asked. \"Kino?\" the girl replied. Sin reached behind me, picked up my arm, and placed it on her shoul\u00ad der. \"Kino is when you touch a girl,\" he whispered. I felt the heat of her body and was reminded of how much I love human contact. Pets like to be petted. It isn't sexual when a dog or a cat begs for physical affection. People are the same way: We need touch. But we're so sexually screwed up and ob\u00ad sessed that we get nervous and uncomfortable whenever another person touches us. And, unfortunately, I am no exception. As I spoke to her, my hand felt wrong on her shoulder. It was just resting there like some disem\u00ad bodied limb, and I imagined her wondering what exactly it was doing there and how she could gracefully extricate herself from under it. So I did her the favor of removing it myself \"Isolate her,\" Sin said. I suggested sitting down, and we walked to a bench. Sin followed and sat behind us. As I'd been taught, I asked her to tell me the qualities she finds attractive in guys. She said humor and ass. Fortunately, I have one of those qualities. Suddenly, I felt Sin's breath on my ear. \"Sniff her hair,\" he was instruct\u00ad ing. I smelled her hair, although I",
  "13": "wasn't exactly sure what the point was. I figured Sin wanted me to neg her. So I said, \"It smells like smoke.\" \"Nooooo!\" Sin hissed in my ear. I guess I wasn't supposed to neg. She seemed offended. So, to recover, I took another whiff \" But under\u00ad neath that, there's a very intoxicating smell.\" She cocked her head to one side, furrowed her brow ever so slightly, scanned me up and down, and said, \"You're weird.\" I was blowing it. Fortunately, Mystery soon arrived. \"This place is dead,\" he said. \"We're going somewhere more target- rich.\" To Mystery and Sin, these clubs didn't seem to be reality. They had no problem whispering in students' ears while they were talking to women, dropping pickup terminology in front of strangers, and even interrupting a student during a set and explaining, in front of his group, what he was do\u00ad ing wrong. They were so confident and their talk was so full of incompre\u00ad hensible jargon that the women rarely even raised an eyebrow, let alone suspected they were being used to train wanna-be ladies' men. I bid my new friend good-bye as Sin had taught me, pointing to my Page 40 28 cheek and saying, \"Kiss good-bye.\" She actually pecked me. I felt very alpha. On the way out, as I stopped to use the bathroom, I found Extramask standing there, twirling an unwashed lock of hair in his fingers. \"Are you waiting for the toilet?\" I asked. \"Sort of,\" he replied nervously. \"Go ahead.\" I gave him a quizzical look. \"Can I tell you something?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" \"I have a lot of trouble peeing beside guys in urinals. When there's an\u00ad other guy standing there, I can't fucking pee. Even if I'm peeing already and a guy walks up, I stop. And then I just stand there all nervous and shit.\" \"No one's judging you.\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I remember about a year ago, a guy and I were trying to piss in these urinals that were right next to each other, but we both just ended up standing there. We stood there for around two minutes, recog\u00ad nizing each other's pee-shyness, until I zipped up and went to another bathroom.\" He paused. \"The guy never thanked me for changing bathrooms that day.\" I nodded, walked to the urinal, and discharged my duties with a dis\u00ad tinct lack of self-consciousness. Compared to Extramask, I was going to be an easy student. As I left the bathroom, he was still standing there. \"I always liked urinal dividers,\" he said. \"But you only seem to find them at the classy places.\" Page 41 I was in high spirits in the limo to the next bar. \"Do you think I could have kissed her?\" I asked Mystery. \"If you think you could have, then you could have,\" he said. \"As soon as you ask yourself whether you should or shouldn't, that means you should. And what you do is, you phase-shift. Imagine a giant gear thudding down in your head, and then go for it. Start hitting on her. Tell her you just no\u00ad ticed she has beautiful skin, and start massaging her shoulders.\" \"But how do you know it's okay?\" \"What I do is, I look for IOIs. An IOI is an indicator of interest. If she asks you what your name is, that's an IOI. If she asks you if you're single, that's an IOI. If you take her hands and squeeze them, and she squeezes back, that's an IOI. And as soon as I get three IOIs, I phase-shift. I don't even think about it. It's like a computer program.\" \"But how do you kiss her?\" Sweater asked. \"I just say, 'Would you like to kiss me?'\" \"And then what happens?\" \"One of three things,\" Mystery said. \"If she says, 'Yes,' which is very rare, you kiss her. If she says, 'Maybe,' or hesitates, then you say, 'Let's find out,' and kiss her. And if she says, 'No,' you say, 'I didn't say you could. It just looked like you had something on your mind.'\" \"You see,\" he grinned triumphantly. \"You have nothing to lose. Every contingency is planned for. It's foolproof. That is the Mystery kiss-close.\" I furiously scribbled every word of the kiss-close in my notebook. No one had ever told me how to kiss a girl before. It was just one of those things men were",
  "14": "supposed to know on their own, like shaving and car re\u00ad pair. Sitting in the limo with a notebook on my lap, listening to Mystery talk, I asked myself why I was really there. Taking a course in picking up women wasn't the kind of thing normal people did. Even more disturbing, I wondered why it was so important to me, why I'd become so quickly ob\u00ad sessed with the online community and its leading pseudonyms. Page 42 30 Perhaps it was because attracting the opposite sex was the only area of my life in which I felt like a complete failure. Every time I walked down the street or into a bar, I saw my own failure staring me back in the face with red lipstick and black mascara. The combination of desire and paralysis was deadly. After the workshop that night, I opened my file cabinet and dug through my papers. There was something I wanted to find, something I hadn't looked at in years. After a half hour, I found it: a folder labeled \"High School Writing.\" I pulled out a piece of lined notebook paper covered from top to bottom with my chicken scratching. It was the only poem I've ever at\u00ad tempted in my life. It was written in eleventh grade, and I never showed it to anyone. However, it was the answer to my question. SEXUAL FRUSTRATION BY NEIL STRAUSS The only reason you go out, The only objective in mind, A glimpse of a familiar pair Of legs on a busy street or A squeeze from a female who You can only call your friend. A scoreless night fosters hostility. A scoreless weekend breeds animosity. Through red eyes all the world is seen, Angry at friends and family for no Reason that they can perceive. Only you know why you are so mad. There is the 'justfriends' one who you've Known for so long, who respects you So much that you can't do what you want. And she no longer bothers to put on her False personality and flirt because she thinks You like her for who she is when what you Liked about her was her flirtatiousness. Page 43 31 When your own hand becomes your best lover, When your life-giving fertilizer is wasted In a Kleenex and flushed down the toilet You wonder when you are going to stop Thinking about what could have happened That night when you almost got somewhere. There is the coy one who smiles And looks like she wants to meet you, But you can't work up the nerve to talk. So instead she will become one of your nighttime Fantasies, where you could have but didn't. Your hand will be substituted for hers. When you neglect work and meaningful activities, When you neglect the ones who really love you, For a shot at a target that you rarely hit. Does everyone get lucky with women but you, Or do females just not want it as bad as you do? In the decade since I'd written that poem, nothing had changed. I still couldn't write poetry. And, more important, I still felt the same way. Per\u00ad haps signing up for Mystery's workshop had been an intelligent decision. After all, I was doing something proactive about my lameness. Even the wise man dwells in the fool's paradise. Page 44 On the last night of the workshop, Mystery and Sin took us to a bar called the Saddle Ranch, a country-themed meat market on the Sunset Strip. I'd been there before\u2014not to pick up women, but to ride the mechanical bull. One of my goals in Los Angeles was to master the machine at its fastest set\u00ad ting. But not today. After three consecutive nights of going out until 2:00 A.M. and then breaking down approaches with Mystery and the other stu\u00ad dents far beyond the allotted half-hour, I was wiped out. Within minutes, however, our tireless professor of pickup was at the bar, making out with a loud, tipsy girl who kept trying to steal his scarf. Watching Mystery work, I noticed that he used the exact same openers, rou\u00ad tines, and lines\u2014and got a phone number or a tonguedown nearly every time, even if the woman was with a boyfriend. I'd never seen anything like it. Sometimes a woman he was talking to was even moved to tears. As I walked toward the mechanical bull ring, feeling",
  "15": "foolish in a red cowboy hat Mystery had insisted I wear, I saw a girl with long black hair, a formfitting sweater, and tan legs sticking out of a ruffled skirt. She was talk\u00ad ing animatedly to two guys, bouncing around them like a cartoon character. One second. Two seconds. Three. \"Hey, looks like the party's over here.\" I spoke to the guys, then turned to face the girl. I stuttered for a moment. I knew the next line\u2014Mystery had been pushing it on me all weekend\u2014but I'd been dreading using it. \"If... if I wasn't gay, you'd be so mine.\" A huge smile spread across her face. \"I like your hat,\" she screeched, grabbing the brim. I guess peacocking did work. \"Hey, now,\" I told her, repeating a line I had heard Mystery use earlier. \"Hands off the merchandise.\" She responded by throwing her arms around me and telling me I was fun. Every ounce of fear evaporated with her acceptance. The secret to meet\u00ad ing women, I realized, is simply knowing what to say, and when and how to say it. \"How do you all know each other?\" I asked. Page 45 33 \"I just met them,\" she said. \"My name is Elonova.\" She curtseyed clumsily. I took that as an IOI. I showed Elonova an ESP trick Mystery had taught me earlier that ever ning, in which I guessed a number she was thinking between one and ten (hint: it's almost always seven), and she clapped her hands together glee\u00ad fully. The guys, in the presence of my superior game, wandered off. When the bar closed, Elonova and I moved outside. Every AFC we walked past gave me the thumbs up and said, \"She's hot\" or \"You lucky bas\u00ad tard.\" What idiots. They were fucking up my game\u2014that is, if I could figure out a way to tell Elonova I was straight. Hopefully, she'd figured it out on her own by now. I remembered Sin telling me to kino, so I put my arm around her. This time, however, she backed away. That was definitely not an IOI. As I took a step toward her to try again, one of the guys she'd been with in the bar ar\u00ad rived. She flirted with him as I stood there stupidly. When she turned back to me a few minutes later, I told her we should hang out sometime. She agreed, and we exchanged numbers. Mystery, Sin, and the boys were all in the limo, watching the whole ex\u00ad change go down. I climbed inside, thinking I was hot shit for number- closing in front of them all. But Mystery wasn't impressed. \"You got that number-close,\" he said, \"because you forced yourself on her. You let her play with you.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"Have I ever told you about cat string theory?\" \"No.\" \"Listen. Have you ever seen a cat play with a string? Well, when the string is dangling above its head, just out of reach, the cat goes crazy trying to get it. It leaps in the air, dances around, and chases it all over the room. But as soon as you let go of the string and it drops right between the cat's paws, it just looks at the string for a second and then walks away. It's bored. It doesn't want it anymore.\" \"So...\" \"So that girl moved away from you when you put your arm around her. And you ran right back to her like a puppy dog. You should have punished her\u2014turned away and talked to someone else. Let her work to get your at\u00ad tention back. After that, she made you wait while she talked to that dork.\" Page 46 34 \"What should I have done?\" \"You should have said, Til let you two be alone,' and started to walk away, as if you were giving her to him\u2014even though you knew she liked you more. You have to act like you are the prize.\" I smiled. I think I really understood. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Be the dancing string.\" I grew silent and thought about it, kicking my legs up against the bar counter of the limousine and slouching into the seat. Mystery turned to Sin, and they talked amongst themselves for several minutes. It felt like they were discussing me. I tried not to make eye contact with them. I wondered if they were go\u00ad ing to tell me that I'd held the workshop up, that I wasn't yet ready for it, that I should study for another six months and then take it",
  "16": "again. Suddenly, Mystery and Sin ended their huddle. Mystery broke into a wide smile and looked straight at me. \"You're one of us,\" he said. \"You're going to be a superstar.\" Page 47 MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Sex Magic AUHOR Mystery My Mystery Method workshop in Los Angeles kicked ass. I've decided to teach several impressive ways to demonstrate mind power through magic at my next workshop. After all, some of you need something with which to convey your charming personalities. If you are going in without an edge\u2014like if you say, \"Hi, I'm an accountant\"\u2014you will not capture your target's attention and curiosity. So, since the workshop, I've retired the FMAC model and broken down the approach to thirteen detailed steps. Here is the basic format to all approaches: 1. Smile when you walk into a room. See the group with the target and follow the three-second rule. Do not hesitate\u2014approach instantly. 2. Recite a memorized opener, if not two or three in a row. 3. The opener should open the group, not just the target. When talking, ignore the target for the most part. If there are men in the group, focus your attention on the men. 4. Neg the target with one of the slew of negs we've come up with. Tell her, \"Its so cute. Your nose wiggles when you laugh.\" Then get her friends to notice and laugh about it. 5. Convey personality to the entire group. Do this by using stories, magic, an\u00ad ecdotes, and humor. Pay particular attention to the men and the less attractive women. During this time, the target will notice that you are the center of atten- Page 48 36 Hon. You may perform various memorized pieces like the photo routine,2 but only for the obstacles. 6. Neg the target again if appropriate. If she wants to look at the pictures, for example, say, \"Oh my god, she's so grabby. How do you roll with her?\" 7. Ask the group, \"So, how does everyone know each other?\" If the target is with one of the guys, find out how long they've been together. If its a serious relationship, eject politely by saying, \"Pleasure meeting you.\" 8. If she is not spoken for, say to the group, \"I've sort of been alienating your friend. Is it all right if I speak to her for a couple of minutes?\" They always say, \"Uh, sure. If its okay with her.\" If you've executed the preceding steps correctly, she will agree. 9. Isolate her from the group by telling her you want to show her something cool. Take her to sit with you nearby. As you lead her through the crowd, do a kino test by holding her hand. If she squeezes back, its on. Start looking for other IOIs. 10. Sit with her and perform a rune reading, an ESP test, or any other demon\u00ad stration that will fascinate and intrigue her. 11. Tell her, \"Beauty is common but what's rare is a great energy and outlook on life. Tell me, what do you have inside that would make me want to know you as more than a mere face in the crowd?\" If she begins to list qualities, this is a positive IOI. 12. Stop talking. Does she reinitiate the chat with a question that begins with the word \"So?\" If she does, you've now seen three IOIs and can . . . 2 The photo routine involves carrying an envelope of photos in a jacket pocket, as if they've just been developed. Each photo, however, is pre-selected to convey a different aspect of the PUA's personality, such as images of the PUA with beautiful women, with children, with pets, with celebrities, goofing off with friends, and doing something active like roller-blading or skydiving. The PUA should also have a short, witty story to accompany each photo. Page 49 37 13. Kiss close. Say, out of the blue, \"Would you like to kiss me?\" If the setting or circumstances aren't conducive to physical intimacy, then give yourself a time constraint by saying, \"I have to go, but we should continue this.\" Then get her number and leave. \u2014Mystery \u2014 Is that a wig?Oh..well it looks nice anyway. \u2014 I think your hair would look better (up/down). \u2014 What do you call that hairstyle, the waffle? *smile* \u2014 You have eye",
  "17": "crusties. No, don't rub them. l *like* eye crusties :-) \u2014 You have beautiful eyes. Can I touch them? \u2014 You kinda have man hands. How cute... your nose wiggles when you talk! Say something again. *smile* \u2014 Eww... you spit on me! \u2014 You blink a lot. \u2014 Nice nails... are they real? Oh... well they look nice anyway. \u2014 I like that skirt. Those are really popular these days. \u2014 I like that skirt. l just saw a girl wearing it a few minutes ago. \u2014 Those shoes look really comfortable. The Mystery Method course handout Page 50 Sure, there is Ovid, the Roman poet who wrote The Art of Love; Don Juan, the mythical womanizer based on the exploits of various Spanish noblemen; the Duke de Lauzun, the legendary French rake who died on the guillotine; and Casanova, who detailed his hundred-plus conquests in four thousand pages of memoirs. But the undisputed father of modern seduction is Ross Jeffries, a tall, skinny, porous-faced self-proclaimed nerd from Marina Del Rey, California. Guru, cult leader, and social gadfly, he commands an army sixty thousand horny men strong, including top government officials, in\u00ad telligence officers, and cryptographers. His weapon is his voice. After years of studying everyone from master hypnotists to Hawaiian Kahunas, he claims to have found the technology\u2014 and make no mistake about it, that's what it is\u2014that will turn any responsive woman into a libidinous puddle. Jeffries, who claims to be the inspiration for Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia, calls it Speed Seduction. Jeffries developed Speed Seduction in 1988, after ending a five-year streak of sexlessness with the help of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), a controversial fusion of hypnosis and psychology that emerged from the personal development boom of the 1970s and led to the rise of self-help gu\u00ad rus like Anthony Robbins. The fundamental precept of NLP is that one's thoughts, feelings, and behavior\u2014and the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of others\u2014can be manipulated through words, suggestions, and physical gestures designed to influence the subconscious. The potential of NLP to revolutionize the art of seduction was obvious to Jeffries. Over the years, Jeffries has either outlasted, sued, or crushed any com\u00ad petitor in the field of pickup to make his school, Speed Seduction, the dom\u00ad inant model for getting a woman's lips to touch a man's\u2014that is, until Mystery came along and started teaching workshops. Thus, the clamor online for an eyewitness account of Mystery's first workshop was overwhelming. Mystery's admirers wanted to know if the class was worthwhile; his enemies, particularly Jeffries and his disciples, wanted to tear him apart. So I obliged, posting a detailed description of my experiences. Page 51 39 At the end of my review, I issued a call for wings in Los Angeles, asking only that they be somewhat confident, intelligent, and socially comfortable. I knew that in order to become a pickup artist myself, I would somehow have to internalize everything I had seen Mystery do. This would happen only through practice\u2014through hitting the bars and clubs every night until I became a natural like Dustin, or even an unnatural like Mystery. The day my report on the workshop hit the Internet, I received an e-mail from someone in Encino nicknamed Grimble, who identified him\u00ad self as a Ross Jeffries student. He wanted to \"sarge\" with me, as he put it. Sarging is pickup artist jargon for going out to meet women; the term evi\u00ad dently has its origin in the name of one of Ross Jeffries's cats, Sargy. An hour after I sent him my phone number, Grimble called. More than Mystery, it was Grimble who would initiate me into what could only be de\u00ad scribed as a secret society. \"Hey, man,\" he said, in a conspiratorial hiss. \"So what do you think of Mystery's game?\" I gave him my assessment. \"Wow, I like it,\" he said. \"But you have to hang out with Twotimer and me some time. We've been sarging with Ross Jeffries a lot.\" \"Really? I'd love to meet him.\" \"Listen. Can you",
  "18": "keep a secret?\" \"Sure.\" \"How much technology do you use in your sarges?\" \"Technology?\" \"You know, how much is technique and how much is just talking?\" \"I guess fifty-fifty,\" I said. \"I'm up to 90 percent.\" \"What?\" \"Yeah, I use a canned opener, then I elicit her values and find out her trance words. And then I go into one of the secret patterns. Do you know the October Man sequence?\" \"Never heard of it, unless Arnold Schwarzenegger was in it.\" \"Oh, man. I had a girl over here last week, and I gave her a whole new identity. I did a sexual value elicitation, and then changed her whole time\u00ad line and internal reality. Then I brushed my finger along her face, telling her to notice\"\u2014and here he switched to a slow, hypnotic voice\u2014\"how wherever I touch ... it leaves a trail of energy moving through you ... and wherever Page 52 40 you can feel this energy spreading ... the deeper you want to allow your\u00ad self. .. to feel these sensations ... becoming even more ... intense.\" \"And then what?\" \"I brushed my finger along her lips, and she started sucking it,\" he ex- claimed triumphantly. \"Full-close!\" \"Wow,\" I said. I had no idea what he was talking about. But I wanted this technology. I thought back to all the times I'd taken women to my house, sat on the bed next to them, leaned in for the kiss, and been deflected with the \"let's just be friends\" speech. In fact, this rejection is such a universal experience that Ross Jeffries invented not just an acronym for it, LJBF, but a litany of re\u00ad sponses as well.3 I talked to Grimble for two hours. He seemed to know everybody\u2014 from legends like Steve P., who supposedly had a cult of women paying cash for the privilege of sexually servicing him, to guys like Rick H., Ross's most famous student, thanks to an incident that involved him, a hot tub, and five women. Grimble would make a perfect wing. 3 One such response from Jeffries is, \"I don't promise any such thing. Friends don't put each other into boxes like that. The only thing I'll promise is never to do anything unless you and I both feel totally comfortable, willing, and ready.\" Page 53 I drove to Grimble's house in Encino the following night to go sarging. This would be my first time in the field since Mystery's workshop. It would also be my first time hanging out one-on-one with a stranger I'd met online. All I really knew about him was that he was a college student and he liked girls. When I pulled up, Grimble strode outside and flashed a big smile that I didn't quite trust. He didn't seem dangerous or mean. He just seemed slip\u00ad pery, like a politician or a salesman or, I suppose, a seducer. He had the complexion of barley tea, though he was actually German. In fact, he claimed to be a descendent of Otto von Bismarck. He wore a brown leather jacket over a silver floral-print shirt, which was unbuttoned to reveal an eerily hairless chest thrust out further than his nose. In his hands was a plastic bag full of videotapes, which he dumped into the back of my car. He reminded me of a mongoose. \"These are some of Ross's seminars,\" he said. \"You'll really like the DC seminar, because he gets into synesthesia there. The other tapes are from Kim and Tom\"\u2014Ross's ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend. \"It's their New York seminar, Advanced Anchoring and Other Sneaky Stuff\" \"What's anchoring?\" I asked. \"My wing Twotimer will show you when you meet him. Ever experi\u00ad enced condiment anchoring before?\" I had so much to learn. Men generally don't communicate to one air other with the same level of emotional depth and intimate detail as most women. Women discuss everything. When a man sees his friends after get\u00ad ting laid, they ask, \"How'd it go?\" And in return, he gives them either a thumbs up or a thumbs down. That's how it's done. To discuss the experi\u00ad ence in detail would mean giving your friends mental images they don't re\u00ad ally want to have. It is a taboo among men to picture their best friends naked or having sex, because then they might find",
  "19": "themselves aroused\u2014and we all know what that means. So, ever since I'd first started harboring lustful thoughts in sixth grade, I'd assumed that sex was something that just happened to guys if they went Page 54 42 out a lot and exposed themselves to chance\u2014after all, that's why they called it getting lucky. The only tool they had in their belt was persistence. Of course, there were some men who were sexually comfortable around women, who would tease them mercilessly until they had them eating out of their hands. But that wasn't me. It took all of my courage to simply ask a woman for the time or where Melrose Avenue was. I didn't know anything about anchoring, eliciting values, rinding trance words, or these other things Grimble kept talking about. How did I ever get laid without all this technology? It was a quiet Tuesday night in the Valley, and the only place Grimble knew to go was the local T.G.I. Friday's. In the car, we warmed up\u2014listening to cassette tapes of sarges by Rick H., practicing openers, faking smiles, and dancing in our seats to get energetic. It was one of the most ridiculous things I'd ever done, but I was entering a new world now, with its own rules of behavior. We walked in the door of the restaurant\u2014confident, smiling, alpha. Un\u00ad fortunately, no one noticed. There were two guys at the bar watching a base\u00ad ball game on television, a group of businesspeople at a corner table, and a mostly male bar staff We strutted to the balcony. As we pushed the door open, a woman appeared. Time to put what I'd learned to the test. \"Hey,\" I said to her. \"Let me get your opinion on something.\" She stopped and listened. She was about four foot ten, with short, frizzy hair and a marshmallow body, but she had a nice smile; she would be good practice. I decided to use the Maury Povich opener. \"My friend Grimble there just got a call today from the Maury Povich show,\" I began. \"And it seems they're doing a segment on secret admirers. Evidently, someone has a little crush on him. Do you think he should go on the show or not?\" \"Sure,\" she answered. \"Why not?\" \"But what if his secret admirer is a man?\" I asked. \"Talk shows always need to put an unexpected twist on everything. Or what if it's a relative?\" It's not lying; it's flirting. She laughed. Perfect. \"Would you do the show?\" I asked. \"Probably not,\" she answered. Suddenly, Grimble stepped in. \"So you would make me go on the show, but you wouldn't do it yourself,\" he teased her. \"You're not adventurous at all, are you?\" It was great to watch him work. Where I would have let the Page 55 43 conversation wane into small talk, he was already leading her somewhere sexual. \"I am,\" she protested. \"Then prove it to me,\" he said, smiling. \"Let's try a little exercise. It's called synesthesia.\" He took a step closer to her. \"Have you ever heard of synesthesia? It will enable you to find all kinds of resources to accomplish and feel the things you want in life.\" Synesthesia is the nerve gas in the arsenal of the speed seducer. Liter\u00ad ally, it is an overlapping of the senses. In the context of seduction, however, synesthesia refers to a type of waking hypnosis in which a woman is put into a heightened state of awareness and told to imagine pleasurable imp ages and sensations growing in intensity. The goal: to make her uncontrol\u00ad lably aroused. She agreed and closed her eyes. I was finally going to get to hear one of Ross's secret patterns. But as soon as Grimble began, a stocky, red-faced jock wearing a pocket undershirt marched up to him. \"What are you doing?\" he asked Grimble. \"I was showing her a self-improvement exercise called synesthesia.\" \"Well, that's my wife.\" I had forgotten to check for a wedding ring, though I doubted minor inconveniences like marriage mattered to Grimble. \"Go disarm the guy,\" Grimble turned to me and hissed, \"while I work on the girl.\" I had no idea how to disarm him. He didn't seem quite as laid-back as Scott Baio. \"He can show you the exercise, too,\" I",
  "20": "said wanly. \"It's really cool.\" \"I don't know what the fuck you're talking about,\" the guy said. \"What is this thing supposed to do to me?\" He took a step closer and leaned his face into mine. He smelled like whiskey and onion rings. \"It tells you whether... whether...\" I stammered. \"Never mind.\" The guy lifted his hands and pushed me backward. Though I tell girls I'm five feet and eight inches, I'm actually five foot six. The top of my head just reached his shoulders. \"Stop it,\" his wife, our former sarge, said. She turned to us. \"He's drunk. He gets like this.\" \"Like what?\" I asked. \"Violent?\" She smiled sadly. Page 56 44 \"You seem like a great couple,\" I said. My attempt to disarm him had clearly failed, because he was about to disarm me. His red drunken face was two inches from mine and yelling about ripping something. \"Pleasure meeting you both,\" I squeaked, slowly backing away. \"Remind me,\" Grimble said as we retreated to the car, \"to teach you how to handle the AMOG.\" \"The AMOG?\" \"Yes, the alpha male of the group.\" Oh, I see. Page 57 Four days later, as I sat at home alone on a Saturday afternoon watching the videos Grimble had given me, he called with good news. He and his wing, Twotimer, were going to meet Ross Jeffries at California Pizza Kitchen for an expedition to the Getty Museum, and I was invited. I arrived fifteen minutes early, selected a booth, and read through printouts of seduction board posts until Ross, Grimble, and Twotimer ar\u00ad rived. Twotimer had black hair gelled to the texture of a licorice vine, a matching leather jacket, and a snake-like quality. With his round, babyish face, he looked like a Grimble clone who'd been inflated by a bicycle pump. As I stood up to introduce myself, Ross cut me off. He was not the most polite person I'd ever met. He wore a long wool overcoat, which flowed loosely around his legs when he walked. He was thin and gawky with gray stubble and greasy skin. His hairline was a receding mop of short, unkempt, ash-colored curls, and the hook in his nose was so pronounced he could have hung his overcoat on it. \"So what did you learn from Mystery?\" Ross asked with a sneer. \"A lot,\" I told him. \"Like what?\" \"Well, one of my sticking points was knowing when a girl was attracted to me. Now I know.\" \"And how do you know?\" he asked. \"When I get three indicators of interest.\" \"Name them.\" \"Let's see. When she asks you what your name is.\" \"That's one.\" \"When you take her hands in yours and squeeze them, and she squeezes back.\" \"That's two.\" \"And, uh, I can't remember the rest right now.\" \"Aha.\" He leapt to his feet. \"Then he's not a very good teacher, is he?\" \"No, he was a great teacher,\" I protested. Page 58 46 \"Then name the third indicator of interest.\" \"I can't think of it right now.\" I felt like an animal backed into a corner. \"Case closed,\" he said. He was good. A short waitress with blue nails, a touch of baby fat, and sandy brown hair arrived to take our order. Ross looked at her, and then winked at me. \"These are my students,\" he told her. \"I'm their guru.\" \"Really?\" she asked, feigning interest. \"What would you say if I told you that I teach people how to use mind control to attract any person they desire?\" \"Get out of here.\" \"Yes, it's true. I could make you fall in love with any person at this table.\" \"And how's that? With mind control?\" She was skeptical, but bordering on curious. \"Let me ask you something. When you're really attracted to somebody, how do you know? In other words, what signals do you get from yourself, inside, that allow you to realize\"\u2014and here he lowered his voice, slowly pro\u00ad nouncing each word\u2014\"you're ... really... attracted... to ... this guy?\" The purpose of the question, I would find out later, was to make the waitress feel the emotion of attraction in his presence, and thus associate those feelings with his face. She thought about it for a moment. \"Well, I guess I get a funny feeling in my stomach, like butterflies.\" Ross put his hand, palm up, in",
  "21": "front of his stomach. \"Yes, and I bet that the more attracted you become, the more those butterflies rise up from your stomach\"\u2014he began slowly raising his hand to the level of his heart\u2014 \"until your face begins to flush ... like it is right now.\" Twotimer leaned over and whispered: \"That's anchoring. It's when you associate a feeling\u2014like attraction\u2014with a touch or a gesture. Now, every time Ross raises his hand like that, she gets attracted to him.\" After a few more minutes of Ross's flirtatious hypnospeak, the wait\u00ad ress's eyes began to glaze over. Ross seized the opportunity to toy with her mercilessly. He raised his hands like an elevator from his stomach to his face every few seconds, smiling as it made her blush every time. The dishes she was carrying were forgotten, balancing precariously on her weakening arm. \"With your boyfriend,\" Ross continued, \"were you attracted right away?\" He snapped, freeing her from her trance. \"Or did it take time?\" Page 59 47 \"Well, we broke up,\" she said. \"But it took a while. We were friends first.\" \"Isn't it so much better, though, when you just feel that sense of attraction\"\u2014he moved his hand up like an elevator and her eyes began to glaze again\u2014\"right away for someone.\" He pointed to himself, which I as\u00ad sumed was another NLP trick to make her think he was that someone. \"It's incredible, isn't it?\" \"Yes,\" she agreed, completely oblivious to her other tables. \"What was wrong with your boyfriend?\" \"He was too immature.\" Ross seized the opportunity. \"Well, you should date more mature men.\" \"I was just thinking that, about you, as we were talking.\" She giggled. \"I bet that when you first came to the table, I was the last person you thought you'd be attracted to.\" \"It's strange,\" she said, \"because you're not my usual type.\" Ross suggested they get together for coffee when she wasn't working, and she jumped at the opportunity to give him her phone number. His tech\u00ad nique was so different than Mystery's, but he seemed to be the real deal too. Ross let out a loud, victorious laugh. \"Well, your other customers are probably getting angry. But before you go, I'll tell you what. Why don't we take all those good feelings you're having right now\"\u2014raising his hands again\u2014\"and put them into this pack of sugar\"\u2014he picked up a sugar pack and rubbed his raised hand on it\u2014\"so that you can carry them around with you all day.\" He handed her the sugar pack. She put it in her apron and walked away, still beet red. \"That,\" Twotimer hissed, \"is condiment anchoring. After he's gone, the sugar pack will remind her of the positive emotions she felt with him.\" As we left the restaurant, Ross ran the exact same routine on the host\u00ad ess and collected her number. Both women were in their twenties; Ross was in his forties. I was floored. We pressed into Ross's Saab and headed to the Getty. \"Anything you want from a woman\u2014attraction, lust, fascination\u2014is just an internal pro\u00ad cess that she runs through her body and her brain,\" he explained as he drove. \"And all you need to evoke that process are questions that make her go into her body and brain and actually experience it in order to answer you. Then she will link those feelings of attraction to you.\" Page 60 48 Sitting in the back seat with me, Twotimer scanned my face for a reac\u00ad tion. \"What do you think?\" he asked. \"Amazing,\" I said. \"Evil,\" he corrected, letting a thin smile creep over his lips. When we arrived at the Getty, Twotimer turned his attention to Ross. \"I wanted to ask you about the October Man sequence,\" he prodded. \"I've been switching around a few of the steps.\" Ross turned to him. \"You understand that these things are very bad?\" As he spoke, Ross wagged a finger at Twotimer's chest, over his heart. He was anchoring again, trying to associate the notion of badness with the for\u00ad bidden pattern. \"There's a reason I don't teach them at my seminars.\" \"Why is that?\" Twotimer asked. \"Because,\" Ross answered, \"it's like giving dynamite to children.\"",
  "22": "Twotimer smiled again. I could tell exactly what he was thinking\u2014 because, in my mind, the word evil was anchored to that smile. \"Darwin talked about survival of the fittest,\" Twotimer explained to me as we walked through the museum's collection of pre-twentieth century art. \"In earlier times, this meant that the strong survived. But strength doesn't help one get ahead in society today. Women breed with seducers, who understand how to trigger, through words and touch, the fantasy parts of the female brain.\" There was something artificial and rehearsed about the way he spoke, the way he moved, the way he looked at me. It felt as if he were sucking my soul into his eyes. \"So the whole idea of survival of the fittest is an anachronism. As players, we stand at the gate of a new era: the survival of the smoothest.\" I liked the idea, though unfortunately I was no smoother than I was strong. My voice was fast and choppy, my movements effete, my body lan\u00ad guage awkward. For me, survival was going to take work. \"Casanova was one of us,\" Twotimer went on. \"But we live a better lifestyle.\" \"Well, it probably took a lot more work to seduce a woman back then because of the morals of the day,\" I said, trying to contribute something useful. \"And we have the technology.\" \"You mean NLP?\" \"Not just that. He had to work alone.\" He grinned as his gaze bore deeper into my eyes. \"We have each other.\" Page 61 49 We lurked through the galleries, gazing at the people gazing at paint\u00ad ings. I watched as Grimble and Twotimer talked to various women. But I was far too scared to approach in front of Ross: It felt like trying to play the cello in front of Yo-Yo Ma. I was afraid he'd criticize everything I did or get upset that I wasn't using enough of his technology. On the other hand, this was a guy who advised students to get over their fear of approaching by walking up to random women and saying, \"Hi, I'm Manny the Martian. What's your favorite flavor of bowling ball?\" So I really didn't have to worry about looking foolish in front of him. He created fools. At the end of the day, Ross had three numbers. Twotimer and Grimble had two each. And I had nothing. As we took the train downhill to the museum parking lot, Ross slid into the seat next to me. \"Listen,\" he said. \"I have a seminar coming up in a few months. And I will let you sit in and take it for free.\" \"Thanks,\" I said. \"I am going to be your guru. Not Mystery. You'll see that what I am teaching is a hundred times more powerful.\" I wasn't sure how to respond. They were competing over me\u2014an AFC. \"And one more thing,\" Ross said. \"In exchange, I want you to take me to five\u2014no, six\u2014Hollywood parties, with super-hot babes. I need to widen my horizons.\" He smiled and asked, \"Do we have a deal?\" as he rubbed his thumb on his chin. I was sure he was anchoring me.

The prey is going to avoid them. They approach the prey slowly and harmlessly, win its trust, and then attack. At least, that's what Sin told me. He facetiously called it Sin Method. Though Mystery had flown back to Toronto after the workshop, I stayed in touch with Sin. I'd watch as a woman came over to his house for the first time and he'd throw her against the wall by her neck, then release her just before he kissed her, shooting her adrenaline level through the roof with equal parts fear and arousal. Then he'd cook her dinner and never speak a word about it until dessert, when he'd stare at her like a tiger eying its prey and say, in a tone of restrained lust, \"You don't even want to know the things I'm thinking of doing to you right now.\" That was generally the point when I'd",
  "23": "excuse myself to go home. Along with the sneakier Grimble, the more predatory Sin became a faithful wing. But our friendship didn't last long. One afternoon, after a sarging session at the Beverly Center mall, Sin informed me that he'd en\u00ad rolled in the Air Force as an officer. \"The military is a steady paycheck,\" he explained as we sat in a mall cafe. \"And I can live wherever I want. I've been an unemployed computer programmer for too long.\" I tried to talk him out of it. Sin was into astral projection, goth rock, S and M, and pickup. He would have to hide all that if he joined the military. But his mind was made up. \"I was talking to Mystery about you,\" he said, leaning low over the metal latticework of the table. His tone, as always, was deadly serious. \"He wants to schedule his next workshop in December. Since I'm not going to be around to wing him, he wants you to do it.\" As I thought of another weekend with Mystery and all his secrets, like the triple-stacked patterns he used to move girls to tears, I tried to control the excitement in my voice. \"I think I'll be free,\" I said. Out of all the potential pickup artists in the world, I couldn't believe that Mystery was choosing me. He must not know that many people. Page 66 54 There was just one small problem: I wasn't going to be fee in Decem\u00ad ber. I'd booked a flight to Belgrade to visit Marko, the schoolmate who had introduced me to Dustin and his natural ways. It was too late to cancel on Marko, but there was no way I was going to miss the opportunity to wing Mystery either. There had to be a solution. That night, I called Mystery in Toronto, where he was living with his parents, his two nieces, his sister, and her husband. \"Hey, buddy,\" Mystery said when he answered. \"I'm bored out of my mind here.\" \"I find that hard to believe.\" \"Well, it's raining and I want to go out. But I have no one to go out with and no clue where to go.\" He paused to tell his nieces to shut up. \"I'll prob\u00ad ably just get some sushi alone.\" I'd assumed that the great Mystery would have girls lined up every night of the week and a wait-list of sargers eager to take him out clubbing. Instead, he was stagnating at home. His father was sick. His mother was overburdened. And his sister was separating from her husband. \"Can't you go out with Patricia?\" I asked. Patricia was Mystery's girl\u00ad friend, the one pictured in her negligee in his pickup resume. \"She's mad at me,\" he said. Mystery had met Patricia four years ago, when she was fresh off the boat from Romania. He tried to mold her into his ideal girl\u2014he talked her into getting a boob job, giving him blow jobs (which she'd never done before), and taking a job as a stripper\u2014but she drew the line at bisexuality. For Mystery, this was a dealbreaker. Everyone has their own reason for getting into the game. Some, like Ex- tramask, are virgins who want to experience what it's like to be with a woman. Others, like Grimble and Twotimer, desire new girls every night. And a few, like Sweater, are searching for the perfect wife. Mystery had his own specific goal. \"I want to be loved by two women,\" he said. \"I want a blonde 10 and an Asian 10, who will love each other as much as they love me. And Patricia's heterosexuality is affecting my sex life with her, because unless I imagine another girl there, I can't always keep my boner.\" He moved the phone to another room because his sister and her husband were arguing, and contin\u00ad ued, \"I'd just break up with Patricia, but there aren't any 10s in Toronto. No outrageous glitter girls. It's all 7s, at best.\" Page 67 55 \"Move to LA,\" I urged. \"This is where all the peacocky girls you like live.\" \"Yeah, I really need to get out of here,\" he sighed. \"So I want to schedule a bunch of workshops. I've got people interested in Miami, Chicago, and New York.\" \"How about Belgrade?\" \"What? Isn't there a war going on there?\" \"No, the war's over. And I have to visit an old friend. He said it's safe. We can stay with him for free,",
  "24": "and Slavic women are supposed to be the most beautiful in the world.\" He hesitated. \"And I have a free companion ticket.\" Silence. He was considering it. I pushed further. \"What the hell. It's an adventure. At the very worst, you'll have a new picture for your photo routine.\" Mystery thought like a flowchart. And if he agreed to something, his as\u00ad sent was given instantly and always with the same word, which he spoke next: \"Done.\" \"Great,\" I said. \"I'll e-mail you the flight times.\" I couldn't wait for the six hour plane ride. I wanted to vacuum every piece of knowledge\u2014every magic trick, every pickup line, every story\u2014out of his head. I wanted to mimic exactly what I'd seen him do, word for word, trick for trick, simply because it worked. \"But wait,\" he said. \"There's something else.\" \"What?\" \"If you're going to be my wing, you can't be Neil Strauss,\" he said with the same air of finality with which he had spoken the word done. \"It's time for you to change, to just snap and become someone else. Think about it: Neil Strauss, writer. That isn't cool. Nobody wants to sleep with a writer. They're at the bottom of the social ladder. You must be a superstar. And not just with women. You are an artist in need of an art. And I think your art is actually the social skills you're learning. I watched you in the field; you adapted quickly. That's why Sin and I picked you. Hold on a minute.\" I heard him rustling through some papers. \"Listen,\" he said. \"These are my personal development goals. I want to raise the money for a touring il\u00ad lusion show. I want to live in posh hotels. I want a limo to and from shows. I want specials on TV with big illusions. I want to levitate over Niagara Page 68 56 Falls. I want to travel to England and Australia. I want jewelry, games, a model airplane, a personal assistant, a stylist. And I want to act in Jesus Christ Superstar\u2014as Jesus.\" At least he knew what he wanted in life. \"What I'm really after,\" he fi\u00ad nally said, \"is for people to be envious of me, for women to want me and men to want to be me.\" \"You never got much love as a child, did you?\" \"No,\" he replied sheepishly. At the end of the conversation, he said he was going to e-mail me the password to a secret online community called Mystery's Lounge. He had created Mystery's Lounge two years before, after an enterprising bartender he'd slept with in Los Angeles found an Internet post he'd written about her on a public seduction newsgroup. After spending a weekend poring through the rest of his online archive, she e-mailed Mystery's girlfriend, Pa\u00ad tricia, and told her about her boyfriend's extracurricular activities. The fall\u00ad out nearly destroyed his relationship, and in the process taught him that there was a downside to being a pickup artist: getting caught. Unlike the other seduction boards I had been reading, where hundreds of newbies were constantly begging for advice from just a few experts, Mys\u00ad tery had cherry-picked the best pickup artists in the community for his pri\u00ad vate forum. Here they not only shared their secrets, stories, and techniques, but also posted pictures of themselves and their women\u2014even, on occasion, video and audio recordings of their exploits in the field. \"But remember,\" Mystery said sternly. \"You are no longer Neil Strauss. When I see you in there, I want you to be someone else. You need a seduc\u00ad tion name,\" He paused and reflected: \"Styles?\" \"How about Style?\" That was one thing I prided myself on: I may never have been socially comfortable, but at least I knew how to dress better than those who were. \"Style it is. Mystery and Style.\" Yes, it was Mystery and Style giving a workshop. It had a nice ring to it. Style the pickup artist\u2014teaching lovable losers how to meet the women of their dreams. But as soon as I hung up, I realized something: First, Style needed to teach himself. After all, it had only been a month since my workshop with Mystery. I still had a long way to go. It was time for a motherfucking change.",
  "25": "Page 69 One of my teenage heroes was Harry Crosby. He was a poet from the 1920s, and, frankly, his poetry sucked. But his lifestyle was legendary. The nephew and godson of J. P. Morgan, he hobnobbed with Ernest Hemingway and D. H. Lawrence, was the first person to publish parts of Joyce's Ulysses, and became a decadent symbol of the lost generation. He lived a fast, opium- enhanced life, and swore he would be dead by the age of thirty. When he was twenty-two, he married Polly Peabody, the inventor of the strapless bra, and persuaded her to change her name to Caresse. For their honeymoon, they locked themselves in a bedroom in Paris with stacks of books and just read. At the age of thirty-one, when he realized that his lifestyle hadn't killed him yet, Crosby shot himself. I didn't have a Caresse to lock up with me, but I shut myself in the house for a week Harry Crosby-style, reading books, listening to tapes, watching videos, and studying the posts in Mystery's Lounge. I immersed myself in seduction theory. I needed to shed Neil Strauss and rewire myself to become Style. I wanted to live up to Mystery and Sin's faith in me. To do so, I'd have to change not just the things I said to women, but the way I acted around them. I needed to become confident, to become inter\u00ad esting, to become decisive, to become graceful, to become the alpha male I was never raised to be. I had a lot of lost time to make up for\u2014and six weeks to do it in. I bought books on body language, flirting, and sexual technique. I read anthologies of women's sexual fantasies, like Nancy Friday's My Secret Gar- den, in order to internalize the idea that women actually want sex as much as\u2014if not more than\u2014men; they just don't want to be pressured, lied to, or made to feel like a slut. I ordered books on marketing, like Robert Cialdini's seminal Influence, from which I learned several key principles that guide the majority of peo\u00ad pie's decisions. The most important of these is social proof, which is the no\u00ad tion that if everyone else is doing something, then it must be good. So if you are in a bar with a beautiful female friend on your arm (a pivot, as they Page 70 call it in the community), it's much easier to meet women than if you're hanging out alone. I watched the videos Grimble had given me and took notes on each, memorizing affirmations (\"if a woman enters my world, it will be the best thing that can ever happen to her\") and patterns. There is a difference be\u00ad tween a line and a pattern. A line is basically any prepared comment made to a woman. A pattern is a more elaborate script, specifically designed to arouse her. Men and women think and respond differently. Show a man the cover of Playboy, and he's ready to go. In fact, show him a pitted avocado and he's ready to go. Women, according to the speed seducers, aren't persuaded as easily by direct images and talk. They respond better to metaphor and sug\u00ad gestion. One of Ross Jeffries's most famous patterns uses a Discovery Channel show about roller coaster design as a metaphor for the attraction, trust, and excitement that are often necessary preconditions for sex The pattern de\u00ad scribes the \"perfect attraction,\" which provides a feeling of excitement as the roller coaster rises to a summit and then whooshes down in a rush; then it offers a feeling of safety, because it was designed to allow you to have this experience in a comfortable, safe environment; finally, as soon as the ride is over, you want to climb back on and ride it again and again. Even if it seems unlikely that a pattern like this will turn a girl on, at least it's better than talking about work. It wasn't enough, though, for me just to study Ross Jeffries. A lot of his ideas are simply applications of neuro-linguistic programming. So I went to the source and bought books by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, the University of California professors who developed and popularized this fringe school of hypnopsychology in the 1970s. After NLP, it",
  "26": "was time to learn some of Mystery's tricks. I spent one hundred and fifty dollars at magic stores, buying videos and books on levi\u00ad tation, metal bending, and mind reading. I'd learned from Mystery that one of the most important things to do with an attractive woman was to demonstrate value. In other words, what makes me any different from the last twenty guys who approached her? Well, if I can bend her fork by looking at it or guess her name before even speaking to her, that's a little different. To further demonstrate value, I bought books on handwriting analy\u00ad sis, rune reading, and tarot cards. After all, everyone's favorite subject is themselves. Page 71 59 I took notes on everything I studied, developing routines and stories to test in the field. I neglected my work, my friends, and my family. I was on an eighteen-hour-a-day mission. When I finally crammed as much information in my brain as it could hold, I started working on body language. I signed up for lessons in swing and salsa dancing. I rented Rebel Without A Cause and A Streetcar Named Desire to practice the looks and poses of James Dean and Marlon Brando. I stud\u00ad ied Pierce Brosnan in the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black, Mickey Rourke in Wild Orchid, Jack Nicholson in The Witches of Eastwick, and Tom Cruise in Top Gun. I looked at every aspect of my physical behavior. Were my arms swing\u00ad ing when I walked? Did they bow out a little, as if trying to get around mas\u00ad sive pectorals? Did I walk with a confident swagger? Could I stick my chest out further? Hold my head up higher? Swing my legs out further, as if try\u00ad ing to get around massive genitalia? After correcting what I could on my own, I signed up for a course on Alexander Technique to improve my posture and rid myself of the round- shouldered curse I'd inherited from my father's side of the family. And be\u00ad cause no one ever understands a word I say\u2014my voice is too fast, quiet, and mumbly\u2014I started taking weekly private lessons in speech and singing. I wore stylish jackets with bright shirts and accessorized as much as I could. I bought rings, a necklace, and fake piercings. I experimented with cowboy hats, feather boas, light-up necklaces, and even sunglasses at night to see which received the most attention from women. In my heart, I knew most of these gaudy accouterments were tacky, but Mystery's peacock the\u00ad ory worked. When I wore at least one item that stood out, women who were interested in meeting me had an easy way to start a conversation. I went out with Grimble, Twotimer, and Ross Jeffries nearly every night and, chunk by chunk, learned a new way to interact. Women are sick of generic guys asking the same generic questions: \"So where are you from?... What do you do for work?\" With our patterns, gimmicks, and routines, we were barroom heroes, saving the female of the species from certain ennui. Not all women appreciated our efforts, of course. Though I was never hit, yelled at, or doused with a drink, stories of spectacular failures circled constantly in the back of my mind. There was the story of Jonah, a twenty- three-year-old virgin in the seduction community who was hit in the back of the head\u2014twice\u2014by a drunk girl who took his negs the wrong way. And there was Little Big Dick, a sarger from Alaska, who was sitting at a table Page 72 60 talking to a girl when her boyfriend came up from behind, yanked him out of his seat, threw him to the ground, and kicked him in the head for two minutes straight, fracturing his left eye socket and leaving boot marks on his face. But they were the exceptions, I hoped. These beat-downs were foremost in my mind as I drove my car to West- wood, home to UCLA, for my first attempt at sarging during the daytime. Despite the cheat sheet of my favorite openers and routines in the back pocket of my jeans, I was petrified as I roamed the streets, trying to select someone for my first approach. As I walked past an Office Depot, I saw a woman",
  "27": "with brown glasses and short blonde hair that danced on her shoulders. She was thin, with smooth, gentle curves, jeans that were just tight enough, and a beautiful complexion, like burned butter. She looked like the undiscovered treasure of the campus. She walked into the store, and I decided to move on. But then I saw her again through the window. She looked like a cool intellectual whose inner bombshell hadn't blossomed yet, someone I could talk with about Tarkovsky movies and then take to a monster truck rally. Maybe this would be my Caresse. I knew that if I didn't approach her, I'd chastise myself af\u00ad terward and feel like a failure. So I decided to attempt my first daytime pickup. Besides, I told myself, she probably wasn't that good-looking up close anyway. I walked into the store and found her in an aisle looking at mailing envelopes. \"Hey, maybe you can help me settle a debate I'm having,\" I told her. As I recited the Maury Povich opener, I noticed that she was even more beauti\u00ad ful at close range. I had stumbled across a genuine 10. And I had to follow protocol and neg her. \"I know this is wrong to say,\" I blurted, \"but I grew up on Bugs Bunny cartoons as a child, and you have the most adorable Bugs Bunny overbite.\" I was worried I'd gone too far. I'd made the neg up on the spot and was probably about to get slapped. But she actually grinned. \"After all those years of braces, my mom's going to be mad,\" she replied. She was flirting back with me. I performed the ESP routine, and fortunately she picked seven. She was amazed. I asked her what she did for work, and she said she was a model Page 73 61 and hosted a show on TNN. The longer we talked, the more she seemed to enjoy the conversation. But as I noticed the material working, I became ner\u00ad vous. I couldn't believe that a woman who looked like this was into me. Everyone in Office Depot was staring at us. I couldn't go on. \"I'm late for an appointment,\" I told her. My hands were shaking from nerves. \"But what steps can we take to continue this conversation?\" This was Mystery's number-close routine. A pickup artist never gives a girl his phone number, because she might not call. A PUA must make a woman comfortable enough to give him her number. He must also avoid asking for it directly, because she could always say no, and instead lead her to suggest the idea herself. \"I could give you my number,\" she offered. She wrote down her name, followed by her number and e-mail address. I couldn't believe it. \"I don't go out much, though,\" she warned, as an afterthought. Maybe she was already having regrets. When I returned home, I pulled the scrap of paper out of my pocket and placed it in front of the computer. Since she was supposedly a model, I wanted to look for a picture of her online. She had only given me her first name, Dalene, but fortunately her e-mail address contained her last name, Kurtis. I typed the words into Google, and nearly a hundred thousand re\u00ad sults came up. I had just number-closed the reigning Playmate of the Year. Page 74 I sat in front of my phone and stared at Dalene Kurtis's number every eve\u00ad ning. But I couldn't bring myself to call. I wasn't confident and good- looking enough for this perfect specimen of femininity. I mean, what was I going to do on a date with her? I remember meeting a girl named Elisa for lunch at a summer job when I was seventeen. I was so nervous, I couldn't stop my hands from shaking or my voice from quavering. And the more awkward I became, the more urn comfortable she grew. By the time the food arrived, I was too self-conscious even to chew in front of her. It was a disaster\u2014and it wasn't even a date. So what hope did I have with the Playmate of the Year? There's a word for this: unworthiness. I felt unworthy. So I waited three days to call, then put it off to the next day, and then decided that calling on the weekend would sound like I had no social life, so I figured I'd call her Monday. And by then a week had passed.",
  "28": "She'd proba\u00ad bly forgotten about me. We'd talked for ten minutes at most, and it had been, admittedly, a soft close. I was just some weird, interesting guy she had met in an office-supply store. There was no reason this woman, who could have her choice of any man in the hemisphere, would want to see me again. So I never called. I was my own worst enemy. My first legitimate success didn't come until a week later. Extramask, from Mystery's workshop, dropped by my apartment in Santa Monica unannounced one Monday night. He was very excited because he'd just made a fascinating discovery. \"I always used to think jerking off and pain came hand in hand,\" he an\u00ad nounced the moment I opened the door. Extramask looked different. He had dyed and spiked his hair, pierced his ears, and bought rings, a necklace, and punk-looking clothes. He actor ally appeared cool. In his hands, he had an Anthony Robbins book, Unlim\u00ad ited Power. We were clearly on the same path. \"What are you talking about?\" I asked. Page 75 63 \"Okay. I beat oft; clean up, and then pull up my underwear, right?\" He walked inside and flopped onto my couch. \"I guess I follow.\" \"But what I didn't realize until yesterday was that I still had cum in my penis hole. So I'd go to sleep, and the cum would harden in my cockhole. Then I'd wake up in the morning and take a pee, but the pee wouldn't come out.\" He put a hand on his crotch and wiggled it to illustrate the point. \"So I'd push harder and a chunk of jizz would fly out of my penis and smash into the wall or some shit.\" \"You're out of your mind.\" I'd never experienced or even heard of this phenomenon before. Extramask was the strange result of a repres\u00ad sive Catholic education and an expansive stand-up comedy ambition. I could never tell if he was experiencing serious angst or just trying to en\u00ad tertain me. \"It hurt like a fucker,\" he continued. \"It was so bad I even stopped jerk\u00ad ing off for a week because I didn't want the pain. But last night I squeezed that shit right out of the cock as soon as I blew a load.\" \"And now you can masturbate to your heart's delight?\" \"Exactly,\" he said. \"And I haven't even told you the good news yet.\" \"I thought that was the good news.\" He raised his voice excitedly. \"I can pee beside people now! It's all about confidence. So the stuff I learned in Mystery's workshop isn't just for chicks after all.\" \"That's true.\" \"It's used for pissing too.\" We drove to La Salsa for burritos. At a table nearby, there was an attrac\u00ad tive but slightly unkempt woman stuffing receipts into a bulging Filofax. She had long, curly brown hair; tiny ferret-like features; and immense breasts that refused to be concealed by her sweatshirt. I broke the three- second rule by about two hundred and fifty seconds but finally worked up the confidence to approach. I didn't want to look like an AFC in front of Extramask. \"I've been taking a course in handwriting analysis,\" I told her. \"While we're waiting for our food, do you mind if I practice on you?\" She looked at me skeptically but then decided I was harmless and consented. I handed her my notebook and told her to write a sentence in it. \"Interesting,\" I said. \"Your handwriting has no slant. It's straight up Page 76 64 and down, which means you're a self-sufficient person and don't always need to be around others to feel good about yourself.\" I made sure she was nodding in agreement, and then continued. This was a technique I had learned from a book on cold-reading that exposed the truisms and body-language-reading techniques that sham psychics use. 'You don't have a great organizational system to your writing, which means that in general you're not good at keeping yourself organized and sticking to a schedule.\" With each tidbit I told her, she leaned in closer and nodded her head more vigorously. She had a wonderful smile and was easy to talk to. She'd just finished a comedy class nearby, she said, and offered to read me some jokes from her notebook. \"I open my shows with",
  "29": "this one,\" she said after my analysis. \"I just got back from the gym, and boy are my arms tired.\" This was her opener. She had it on a cheat sheet that she kept in her back pocket. Picking up women, I realized, was a lot like stand-up comedy or any other performing art. They each require openers, routines, and a memorable close, plus the ability to make it all seem new every time. She said she was spending the night at a hotel in town, so I offered to drive her there. As I dropped her off, I pointed to my cheek and said, \"Kiss goodbye.\" She kissed my cheek. Extramask kicked the back of my seat excit\u00ad edly. Then I told her I had work to do, but that I'd call her for a drink when I was finished. \"Do you want to go out clubbing with Vision and me tonight?\" Extra- mask asked after she left. \"No, I should see this girl.\" \"Well, I'm going out anyway,\" he said. \"But when I get home afterward, I'm going to pound out the biggest batch thinking about that girl who just kissed you.\" Before leaving to pick her up that night, I printed one of the forbidden Ross Jeffries patterns Grimble had e-mailed me. I was determined to make up for my recent mistake. We went to a dive bar and had a drink. She had changed into a frayed blue sweater and saggy jeans, which made her look somewhat dumpy. Nonetheless, I was happy to be on an actual date with a woman I'd picked up. Finally, I had an opportunity to experiment with more advanced material. \"There's a way,\" I told her, \"that you can bring better focus to your goals and your life.\" I felt like Grimble in T.G.I. Friday's. Page 77 65 \"What is that?\" she asked. \"It's a visualization exercise. A friend taught it to me. I don't know it by heart, but I can read it to you.\" She wanted to hear it. \"Good.\" I said, as I unfolded the paper with the pattern on it and began reading. \"Maybe you can try to remember the last time you felt happiness or pleasure. As you feel it now, where in your body are those feelings?\" She pointed to the center of her chest. \"And how good does it feel on a scale of one to ten?\" \"Seven.\" \"Okay, now, as you focus in on this feeling right here, notice that you can begin now to see a color flowing from this feeling. What is the color?\" \"Purple,\" she said, as she closed her eyes. \"Good, now what would it be like if you were to allow all of the purple flowing from that spot to fill with warmth and intensity? With each breath that you take, I want you to let the purple grow just a little bit brighter.\" Her body began to relax; I could see her chest rise and fall through her sweater. I was doing it now\u2014evoking a response like the one I had seen Ross Jeffries get at California Pizza Kitchen. I continued with the pattern more confidently, making the color expand and grow in intensity inside her as she fell deeper into trance. I imagined Twotimer mouthing the word evil in the background. \"How do you feel now, on a scale of one to ten?\" I asked. \"Ten,\" she said. I guess it was working. Then I had her shrink the color to a tiny purple pea that contained all the power and intensity of the pleasure she was feeling. I had her place the imaginary pea in my hand. Then I traced my hand all along her body, first at a distance and then lightly touching it. \"Notice how my touch can become like a paintbrush, transferring those colors and that sensation up your wrist, through your arm, and to the surface of the face.\" To be honest, I had no idea whether this was turning her on or not. She was listening, and she seemed to be enjoying it, but she didn't start sucking my fingers like the girl in Grimble's story. In fact, I felt not only a little stu\u00ad pid but also lecherous using the pretext of hypnosis to touch her. I didn't like these forbidden patterns. I got into the game to learn confidence, not mind control. I stopped and asked her what she thought. \"It felt good,\" she said, and Page 78 66 smiled her ferret smile. I couldn't tell whether she was humoring me or not, but I suppose most people are",
  "30": "willing to try something new if it seems safe. I folded the piece of paper, put it in my pocket, and drove her back to her hotel. But instead of dropping her off, I pulled into the garage. We climbed out of the car, and I followed her to her room. I was too scared to say a word, afraid she might suddenly turn on me and ask, \"Why are you following me?\" But she seemed to have mentally consented: It looked like we were going to have sex tonight. I couldn't believe my luck. After all that practice, I was finally getting results. According to Mystery, it takes roughly seven hours for a woman to be comfortably led from meet to sex These seven hours can take place all in one night, or over several days: approaching and talking for an hour; speak\u00ad ing on the phone for an hour; meeting for drinks for two hours; talking on the phone for another hour; and then, on the next meeting, hanging out for two more hours before going to bed together. Waiting seven hours or more is what Mystery calls solid game. But oc\u00ad casionally a woman either goes out with the specific intention of taking someone home, or can be easily led to sex in a shorter amount of time. Mys\u00ad tery calls this fool's mate. I had spent an hour with this girl at La Salsa and two hours at the bar. I was about to experience my first fool's mate. She put the card key in the lock of her room and the green light appeared\u2014an omen, I felt, of the night of passion to come. She opened the door, and I followed her inside. She sat on the foot of the bed\u2014just like in the movies\u2014and pulled her shoes off First the left, then the right. She was wearing white socks, which I found rather endearing. She flexed the toes of both feet upward, then curled them downward as she collapsed backward on the bed. I took a step toward her, prepared to fall on her in an embrace. But sud\u00ad denly the foulest smell I have ever encountered assailed my nostrils. It liter\u00ad ally pushed me backward. It was the exact rancid-cheese smell that homeless alcoholics on New York subways have. The kind that clears the whole subway car. No matter how many steps back I took, the intensity of the smell did not diminish. It filled the entire room, every available space. I looked at her, lying back on the bed, wanton, oblivious. It was her feet. Her feet were stinking up the room. I had to get out of there. Page 79 Every night after outings and dates, seduction students and masters post online breakdowns of their experiences, called field reports. The goals in chronicling their adventures vary: Some want help with mistakes, others want to share new techniques, and a few just want to brag. The day after my misadventure with the stinky-footed comedian, Extramask posted afield report online. Evidently, he had experienced his own odd adventure that same night. His time in the seduction community had already paid off. He could pee in toilet stalls next to other men; he could masturbate without hurting himself, and, now, at the age of twenty-six, he had finally lost his virginity\u2014 though not in the way he expected. MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014I F-closed a Girl! AUTHOR: Extramask I, Extramask, have f-closed a girl for the first time\u2014eliminating my virgin status (even though I didn't blow my load). I'll start from the beginning. On Monday, I went sarging with Vision. We went to this three-story club that had about fifteen rooms, each with its own individual bar. We pretty much sarged the whole place. Overall for the night, I was feeling out of state, and it was reflecting in my sarges. I wasn't doing as well as I normally do. I went to the second floor and found Vision. Some girl was wearing his scarf and he couldn't find her. So I was talking to him about this, and then this girl, WideFace, walked by and gave me serious eye contact. She said, \"Hi.\" Chicks rarely open me, so I said to her, \"Hey, have you seen this guy's scarf?\" I just talked bullshit. I knew it didn't matter what I said by the look on her wide face.",
  "31": "After scarf chat: Page 80 68 WIDEFACE: You are very beautiful [spoken with a quarter Chinese/quarter English/quarter rich Chinese/quarter Zsa Zsa Gabor accent] EXTRAMASK: Is that rights Thank you WIDEFACE: So, when did you get here2 As you can see, the conversation was lame, but I knew it was on I knew if I ran my routines on her, then I'd be going backward in the sarge We talked about standard shit work, what we did tonight, brief history of ourselves, etc We moved to a location that wasn't as crowded (She requested the move ) As we stood around chatting, Vision gave me social proof by occasionally walking by and patting me on the shoulder and shit like that It all helps WIDEFACE: What are you looking for tonights EXTRAMASK: (Thinking Holy Shit\u2014I think I'm gonna get laid ) EXTRAMASK: I don't know What are you looking for? WIDEFACE: I am looking for excitement EXTRAMASK: Yeah, I'm looking for excitement too (spoken casually) WIDEFACE: Would you like to come with my friend and me2 EXTRAMASK: Sure, |ust let me tell my friend that I'm leaving WIDEFACE: Okay, I'll be right over there I went looking for Vision EXTRAMASK: Dude, its on I think I'm gonna get laid VISION: Go, go Get out of here Okay, so I found WideFace and her Serbian girlfriend We held hands and walked to her car, which was about fifteen minutes away I was pretty nervous about the whole thing Then I calmed the fuck down What did we talk about on the way to her car2 Nothing much, |ust lame talk about how cold it was, what I do, and other general chitchat It was so implied that this was a one-night stand We got to her car and her friend said she wanted pizza Here's what Extramask was thinking EXTRAMASK: FUCK PIZZA, YOU STUPID BITCH I'M A VIRGIN AND I WANT TO GET LAID FUCKING NOW GO TAKE YOUR OWN CAR AND GET YOUR OWN FUCKING PIZZA Page 81 69 Conveniently, WideFace forgot about the pizza and accidentally passed by the store We dropped her friend off, and I moved to the front seat I was looking at her mediocre body thinking, \"This is cool I'm gonna get to touch all of that shit\" Again, the conversation in the car wasn't about sex It was lame chitchat When I previously asked her what course she was taking in school, she said, \"I'll tell you later\" I asked her this about three times, and each time she got more frustrated with me I didn't care It fucking bugged me that this was the only thing she wouldn't tell me She ended up telling me when we were alone in her car It was some lamo general college course It was a nonissue Then she told me her \"dream |ob \" I asked her about it, even though I didn't give a shit WIDEFACE: I want to be a police officer EXTRAMASK: (Thinking You'd be the worst police officer on the planet You'll never be a police officer) EXTRAMASK: Why don't you pursue your dream2 WIDEFACE: Blah blah blah, drivel drivel drivel, jibber jabber jibber jabber We got to her place She lives in the penthouse of this big fucking condo with a roommate Her room was fucking huge She had this big Trinitron TV in it She told me to choose some music, because she was going to the bathroom for a bit I put on some hip hop channel since she said she liked that kind of stuff earlier She came out in her pajamas I pinned her to the ground and bukkaked her! No, seriously she came out in her pa|amas and told me I could go use the bathroom. I didn't need to, but I figured this was part of the whole sex thing, so I went. Remember, brothers, I was virgin at this point\u2014 I had no clue So I went to the bathroom and just kinda stood there. I didn't wash my cock or anything The only thing I thought of doing was calling Vision to tell him that I was about to fuck her, but I thought that would be lame So, I was thinking, should I walk out totally nude? Hmm. I decided to walk out the same way I went in, which was wearing everything except for my dress shirt Imagine if I walked out totally nude with a throbbing boner |ust pulsating in the air? The lights were off She was lying on the bed. I",
  "32": "walked over and started making out with her I kissed her neck and her earlobes Then she took my Page 82 70 hand and put it on her right boobie! So I started rubbing that while kissing her. Then somehow I started rubbing her vagina (over her pajamas). She was moaning and shit. So I took my pants off, but I left my underwear on. I bet you fuckers didn't think I'd be writing this much detail, did you? So I was kissing her and rubbing her poon down. This was pretty hard. I couldn't concentrate on kissing her and rubbing her at the same time. I was doing my best though. She started rubbing my cock, and it felt pretty cool. LOL WIDEFACE: Fuck me Extramask. EXTRAMASK: Okay. So I tore off my fucking underwear. I kneeled there on her bed with my rock-hard boner pulsating, throbbing\u2014you know it. WIDEFACE: Put on a condom. I have one. EXTRAMASK: I have one of my own. I didn't want to use hers. I was freaked out about it for some reason, like she would sabotage it or some shit. WIDEFACE: What brand? EXTRAMASK: Sheik. Again, I was a virgin at this point and I didn't know how to properly put a condom on. EXTRAMASK: Put the condom on, it turns me on. WIDEFACE: Okay. She couldn't get the condom on, so she went to get hers. As she went and got hers, I ended up getting my own on. Then I fucked her! I fucked her and fucked her and fucked her and fucked her and fucked her and fucked her. About fifteen minutes into the whole thing, I was thinking, \"This fucking sucks. This is fucking sex? I hate this. I want to leave.\" I legitimately wanted to leave. I was thinking, \"I busted my fucking balls for months for this?\" Page 83 71 I was sitting there pumping this girl missionary style for fifteen minutes getting no feeling. She was all moaning and shit, and I'm just pumping away like a tool. So I decided to move her around and try some positions\u2014just like in the porno movies! I had her on top. I had always fantasized about this. So she was on top of me and I was thinking, \"Holy shit, this fucking hurts. My cock is gonna fucking snap off.\" After about two minutes, I changed positions because it hurt so much. I got her into doggy-style position. I thought this would be interesting. So I had her from behind and I was trying to find the slot, but I couldn't. I was sitting there fishing around her ass and upper legs looking for the entry. It was horrible, just like the sex. I couldn't find the hole. She started to whine because of the long delay. I was thinking, \"You're whining? Calm it down, China\u2014seriously.\" I wasn't getting any arousal out of this deal. I got it in for two strokes, then it popped out. Then she started whining again. So I switched positions and, for some reason, I went to the her-on-top position again. Dumb move, Extramask. I feared my cock would break right the fuck off. After about four minutes of that, we went back to missionary, and I slammed her hard. Hey, she said she wanted it. I was saying shit like: 'You like that?\" \"Say my name!\" 'You like it hard?\" Keep in mind, I was bored out of my mind during this whole experience. I was pretty disappointed. LOL After thirty minutes: WIDEFACE: Change your condom. EXTRAMASK: (Thinking: I guess this is something you do after a half hour of sex. But overall I was pissed that the sex wasn't over.) So I took my condom off and opened a new one. WIDEFACE: What are you doing? EXTRAMASK: I'm putting on another condom. Page 84 72 WIDEFACE: Why? EXTRAMASK: I thought you said you wanted me to? WIDEFACE: No. I didn't care. I was happy with that. So then we just lay naked together and kissed a bit. She wanted to cuddle. I didn't really want to, but I did. This was a mistake on my part. After sex I should have ripped my condom off, sat on her bed, and jerked off until completion. I should have wacked my load all over the place, her face, and her Trinitron TV set. WIDEFACE: Lie down and rest for five minutes. Then I will call a cab. EXTRAMASK: What? Five minutes? Why are you trying to rush me out of here?",
  "33": "WDEFACE: No, I didn't mean it like that. Its just good to rest after sex for five minutes. EXTRAMASK: What's with the five minutes thing? WDEFACE: No. Just relax. EXTRAMASK: But why five minutes? Five minutes later she called a cab. She was on hold with the cab company, and she started getting all frustrated because she had to wait, which was annoying. So I got ready to leave. I chatted with her a bit more. She said she noticed in the club that I had lots of energy. She liked it. WDEFACE: What are you going to do now? [It was 3:30 AM.) EXTRAMASK: I'm going to another club to hook up with my friends. [I got even more energetic. I jumped around.) She totally didn't like that I said I was going out again. And I really wasn't. I just lied to her. I did it because I was pissed that she was trying to get rid of me so quickly. Overall, I wanted to leave her place immediately\u2014I just wanted to leave on my terms. So the cab arrived and I left her place. We kissed about three times before my exit. I didn't get her number because: Page 85 73 1. I didn't want to fuck her again. 2. It was obvious this was a one-night stand. Just to be on the safe side, I made sure I wrote down her exact address when I left\u2014just in case I forgot shit there. I would rather have it than not have it. So that's it. I stuck my junk in a chick. I lost my virginity. The sex was horrible. I felt a bit dirty and used after the act. Overall, I don't feel any different compared to when I was a virgin. However, I believe this will help me subconsciously in my sarges. I mean, I've had sex now. I know this. So from here on in, any girl I chat with, I'll be even more like, \"Who gives a fuck? I don't need what you got.\" \u2014Extramask Page 86 How do you kiss a girl? The distance between you and her is just three inches. It's not a long stretch, by any standard. You barely even have to move your body to bridge the gap. Yet it is the most difficult three inches a man has to move in his life. It is the moment when the male must concede all the privileges that are his birthright; put his pride, ego, esteem, and hard work aside; and just hope- hope that she doesn't deflect it with her cheek or, even worse, the let's-just- be-friends speech. As I went out every night training to wing Mystery's workshop, I soon developed a routine that worked\u2014at least to a point. Rejection wasn't an option. I knew how to open a group, respond to most contingencies, and leave with a phone number and a plan to meet again. Every time I went home, I reviewed the events of the night, looking for parts of a sarge that I could have done better. If the approach didn't work, I thought of ways to improve it\u2014angles of advance, backturns, takeaways, time constraints. If I didn't get the phone number, I didn't blame it on the girl for being cold or bitchy, as so many other sargers did. I blamed myself and analyzed every word, gesture, and reaction until I pinpointed a tactical error. I had read in a book called Introducing NLP that there is no such thing as failure, only learning lessons. I wanted the learning lessons to take place in my head, so that in the field I was flawless. I would have to prove myself to Mystery's students, just as Sin had proven himself to me. And one public failure would discredit everything. The students would post reviews saying that Style was an imposter, a joke. But there was still one problem I couldn't work through. Though an opener, a neg, and a demonstration of higher value were enough to get any\u00ad one's phone number, I had no idea what to do next. No one had taught me. I mean, I technically knew the words of the Mystery kiss-close: \"Would you like to kiss me?\" But I was too petrified to actually speak them. After spending so much time bonding with a girl (whether for a half hour in a Page 87 75 club or several hours at our next meeting), I was too scared to break the rap\u00ad port and trust I had built. Unless she gave me a clear indication that she was sexually interested in me, I",
  "34": "felt like trying to kiss her would disappoint her and she'd think I was just like all the other guys. It was such stupid AFC thinking. There was still a nice guy lurking in my head that I had to get rid of But, unfortunately, there wasn't going to be time to do so before Belgrade. Page 88 I'd learned several sleights of hand, a principle of magic called equivoque, the fundamentals of rune reading, and a way to make lit cigarettes disap\u00ad pear. It had been the most productive plane trip of my life. And now Mystery and I were in Belgrade at probably the worst time of the year. Ice and slush lay heavy on the street as Marko drove us to his apartment in a silver 1987 Mercedes that had a habit of stalling every time he put it into second gear. Mystery, hair unwashed and held back in a greasy ponytail, fumbled through his backpack in the front seat, producing a long black overcoat. He had cut away the bottom third of the coat and sewn in its place black fabric covered with stars. It looked like something one would wear to a Renais\u00ad sance fair. Mystery had made his ring himself, too, painting an eyeball on the plastic surface. He was clearly more of a geek than I had ever been. His greatest illusion was transforming himself into a good-looking player every night he went out. \"You're going to have to shave your head,\" he said as he looked at me. \"No thanks. What if I have a strange-shaped skull, or weird marks on my head like my dad?\" \"Look at you. You're wearing glasses because your vision sucks. You have a hat on to cover a huge bald spot. You're ghostly white. And you look like you haven't seen the inside of a gym since grade school. You're doing well because you're smart and you're a fast learner. But looks count too. You're Style, so start being Style. Just snap: shave your head, get Lasik, join a gym.\" He was a very persuasive geek. He turned to Marko: \"Is there a barbershop around here?\" Unfortunately, there was. Marko pulled in front of a small building, and we walked inside to find an elderly Serbian man presiding over an empty shop. Mystery sat me in a chair, told Marko to instruct the barber to remove my tumbleweeds, and then supervised the procedure to make sure the barber shaved down to the skull. \"Balding is not a choice, but bald is a choice,\" he said. \"If anyone asks Page 89 77 you why your head is shaved, tell them, 'I used to have it down past my ass, but then I realized I was covering up my best feature.'\" He laughed. \"Or you could say, 'Well, most Greco-Roman wrestlers shave their heads.\" I made a mental note to add both replies to my cheat sheet. When the barber finished, I looked in the mirror and saw a chemo pa\u00ad tient staring back at me. \"It looks good,\" Mystery said. \"Let's see if there's a tanning salon around here. We'll have you looking like a thug in no time.\" \"Okay. But I'm not getting Lasik in Serbia.\" My first thought once I was shaven-headed and tan was: What took me so long? I looked much better. I had transformed from a 5 to a 6.5 on the at\u00ad tractiveness scale. This trip was turning out to be a good idea. Marko looked as if he could use a makeover himself. A big-boned six foot three, he was much stockier than most Serbians, with an olive com\u00ad plexion and the out-of-proportion head of a Peanuts character. He wore an overcoat that was one size too big, a thick gray Brooks Brothers sweater with flecks of white, and a cream-colored turtleneck that actually made him look like a turtle. Marko had been unable to live his dream of being a high-society so\u00ad cialite after graduating from college in America, so he'd moved to a smaller pond, Serbia, where his father was a well-known artist. He drove us to his one-bedroom apartment, which contained only a cot and a twin bed. Because there was no sleeping bag or even a couch, we agreed to take turns sharing the larger bed. While Mystery showered, Marko pulled me aside. \"What are you doing with this guy?\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, he's totally superficial. We went",
  "35": "to the Latin School of Chicago. We went to Vassar College. This is not the kind of guy who can fit in at these places. He's not one of us.\" \"I know. I know. You're right. But trust me, this guy will change your life.\" \"Well,\" Marko said. \"We'll see. I met a girl last month who's different than all the rest, and I want to do it right. So make sure Mystery doesn't ruin it with all his pickup tricks and embarrass me.\" Marko hadn't dated a single woman since he'd moved to Belgrade. But a few months ago, through friend of his, he'd met a girl named Goca, and Page 90 78 he was sure she was the one. He took her out on dates, bought her flowers, treated her to dinner, and dropped her off at home afterward, like a perfect gentleman. \"Have you slept with her yet?\" I asked him. \"No. I haven't even kissed her.\" \"Dude, you're behaving like a total AFC. One day a guy is going to walk up to her in a club, say, 'Do you think magic spells work?' and take her home. She wants an adventure. She wants to have sex All girls do.\" \"Well,\" Marko said, \"she's different from all those girls. People have more class here than they do in LA.\" The PUAs have a name for this: They call it one-itis. It's a disease AFCs get: They become obsessed with a girl they're neither dating nor sleeping with, and then start acting so needy and nervous around her that they end up driving her away. The cure for one-itis, PUAs like to say, is to go out and have sex with a dozen other girls-and then see if this flower is still so special. Page 91 The prop bag I wore to the Belgrade workshop was black, Armani, and the size of a hardcover novel, with a single shoulder strap so that it could be slung artfully across my torso. With so many magic tricks, gimmicks, and other tools of the trade necessary to use in the field, it was impossible to fit everything into just four pants pockets. So nearly every PUA in the game had a prop bag. The contents of mine were as follows: 1 PACK OF GUM, WRIGLEY'S BIG RED No matter how good your game is, you're not going to get a kiss- close if your breath reeks. 1 PACK OF CONDOMS, TROJAN, LUBRICATED Necessary not only in case you have sex but also for the psycho\u00ad logical boost of knowing you're prepared to. 1 PENCIL, 1 PEN For writing down phone numbers, taking notes, performing magic tricks, and analyzing handwriting. 1 PIECE OF DRYER LINT For the lint opener: Walk up to a woman, stop, wordlessly remove lint (hidden in the palm of your hand) from her clothing, ask, \"How long has that been there?,\" then hand her the piece of lint. 1 ENVELOPE OF PRESELECTED PHOTOS For Mystery's photo routine. 1 DIGITAL CAMERA For Mystery's digital photo routine: First take a photo of yourself and a girl smiling, then another one striking a serious pose, and, Page 92 80 finally, one kissing (on the cheek or lips). Afterward, look through the photos with her. At the final photo, say, 'We make a good cou\u00ad pie, don't we?\" If she agrees, you're in. 1 BOX OF TIC TACS For the Tic Tac routine: Put two Tic Tacs in your hand. Eat one very slowly. Then feed the second one to her. If she accepts it, say, \"There's something I forgot to tell you. I'm an Indian giver. I want my Tic Tac back.\" Then kiss her. LIP BALM, COVERUP, EYELINER, BLOTTING PAPER Optional male makeup. CHEAT SHEET, THREE PAGES One page of favorite routines for quick reference. Two pages of new routines and lines to practice. 1 SET OF WOODEN RUNES IN CLOTH BAG For rune readings. 1 NOTEBOOK For phone numbers, notes, magic tricks, and Ross Jeffries's crappy sketch artist opener, in which you very seriously draw a portrait of a girl, tell her \"your beauty has inspired me to high art,\" and then show her a stick figure with a title like, \"Semipretty Girl in Coffee Shop, 2005.\" 1 KRYPTOLIGHT NECKLACE Glow in the dark necklace, for peacocking. 2 SETS OF FAKE EAR AND LIP PIERCINGS Optional body adornment. 1 SMALL DIGITAL RECORDER For surreptitiously recording sarges to play back and critique afterward. Page 93 81 2",
  "36": "SPARE CHEAP NECKLACES, 2 SPARE THUMB RINGS To give to girls as gifts after a number-close. Ask, \"You're not a thief are you?\" Then slowly remove your necklace or thumb ring, put it on her, kiss her, and say, \"This is still mine. It's something to remember me by. I want it back next time I see you.\" After she leaves, replace your jewelry with a spare from the bag. 1 SMALL BLACKLIGHT For pointing out lint and dandruff on girls' clothing\u2014a neg. 4 SAMPLE BOTTLES OF DIFFERENT COLOGNES For smelling good. And for the cologne opener: Spritz a different cologne on each wrist. Then have a girl smell your wrists and choose a favorite. Afterward, mark her choice on the appropriate wrist with a pen. Tally the results at the end of the night to find the best scent for yourself. VARIOUS MAGIC TRICKS For bending forks, making cigarettes vanish, and levitating beer bottles. Yes, I was bringing out the big guns. It was an important night\u2014my first workshop as a wing\u2014and I needed to prove myself I had neglected to tell Mystery that his standard workshop fee was half the annual salary of the average Serbian, so most of our students were from out of the country. They met us at Ben Akiba, a lounge just off the central square in Belgrade. Exoticoption was an American who had taken a train from Florence, Italy, where he was going to school; Jerry was a ski instructor from Munich, Germany; and Sasha was a local who had been studying in Austria. Strangers size each other up in seconds: a hundred tiny details, from dress to body language, combine to create a first impression. Mystery's task\u2014and now mine\u2014was to fine-tune the details and make PUAs out of these three. Exoticoption was cool; in fact, he was trying so hard to be cool that it was going to work against him. Jerry had a great sense of humor but came off on first impression as boring. And Sasha\u2014well, he was badly in need of Page 94 82 repair. Just socializing was going to be a challenge for him: He looked like a big baby goose with acne. This time, it was my turn to go around the table and ask, \"What's your score?\" and \"What are your sticking points?\" and \"How many girls would you like to sleep with?\" Exoticoption, who was twenty, had been with two women. \"I have the balls to approach, and I did pull some hons in the past,\" he began, draping his left arm casually over a neighboring seat. \"But my sticking point is the at\u00ad tract phase. Even when I get vibes that I attract them, I still don't close.\" Jerry, who was thirty-three, had been with three women. \"I can work coffee shops and most other low-noise environments, but I'm uncomfort\u00ad able in clubs.\" And Sasha, who was twenty-two, said he had been with one woman, though we suspected he was exaggerating by one. \"I'm into the game be\u00ad cause it's like Dungeons and Dragons. When I learn a neg or a routine, it's like getting a new spell or a staff that I can't wait to use.\" One by one, they placed their fears, and their voice recorders, on the table. My job was to get them into the game. I needed to get what was in my head into theirs. The teaching portion of the workshop was easy. All I had to do was keep Mystery on track\u2014he loved the sound of his own voice\u2014and give them material. The challenge was going to be the demonstration part. As we spoke, we sent the boys on missions to various tables. We had them open sets,4 watched their body language and the responses of the women, then gave them feedback: \"You were leaning into the set, which showed neediness. Stand up straight and rock on your back foot as if you might walk away at any moment.\" \"You were making them uncomfortable by hovering over them for so long. You should have sat down and given yourself a time constraint. Say, 1 can only stay for a couple minutes because I have to rejoin my friends soon.' This way they won't worry that you're going to sit there all night.\" A set is a group of people in a public place. A two-set is a group of two people; a three-set is three people, and so on. Page 95",
  "37": "83 Sasha did the worst. He fumbled through his openers, stared at his shoes, and lacked even a modicum of confidence. Girls listened to him only out of politeness. At the bar, I noticed a delicate black-haired girl and a tall blonde with a perfect fake tan, deep dimples, and hair in Bo Derek braids. They radiated err' ergy and confidence. This was not going to be an easy set. So I gave it to Sasha. \"Go into the two-set over there,\" I instructed him. It didn't take any game to send guys into sets. \"Tell them you're showing some friends from America around and want suggestions for good clubs to take them to.\" It was a crash-and-burn mission. Sasha meekly approached them from behind and tried several times to get them to notice him. Once he had their attention, it was a struggle for him to keep it. Like many guys, he didn't communicate with energy. All those years of insecurity and social ostracism had chased his spirit and joy of life deep within his body. Whenever he opened his mouth, there was no need for anyone to strain to make out his faint mumblings. The message was clear: \"I was built to be ignored.\" \"Go in,\" Mystery said to me as he watched Sasha flounder with the Bo Derek blonde. \"What?\" \"Go in. Help him out. Show the boys how it's done.\" Fear seizes hold in your chest first. It clamps gently to the top of the heart, like a vice made of rubber. Then you really feel it. Your stomach churns. Your throat closes. And you swallow, desperately trying to avoid the dryness and hoping that when you open your mouth, a confident, clear voice will emerge. Even after all my training, I was terrified. Women, by and large, are much more perceptive than men. They can instantly spot insincerity and bullshit. So a great pickup artist must either be congruent with his material\u2014and really believe it\u2014or be a great actor. Anyone talking to a woman while simultaneously worrying about what she thinks of him is going to fail. Anyone caught thinking about getting into a woman's pants before she starts thinking about what's in his pants is going to fail. And most men fall into this category. Sasha does. I do. We can't help it: It's our nature. Mystery calls it dynamic social homeostasis. We are constantly buffeted about by, on one hand, our overwhelming desire to have sex with a girl and, on the other, the need to protect ourselves when approaching. The reason this fear exists, he says, is because we are wired evolutionarily for a tribal ex\u00ad istence, where everyone in the community knows when a man is rejected by Page 96 84 a woman. He is then ostracized and his genes, as Mystery puts it, are un- apologetically weeded out of existence. As I approached, I tried to push the fear out of my chest and rationally assess the situation. Sasha's problem was his body position. Both women were facing the bar, and he had approached from behind. So they had to turn around to respond. But if they wanted to get rid of him, all they had to do was to turn back toward the bar, and he'd be shut out. I looked back. Mystery and the other two students were watching me as I approached. I had to work the angles right. So I came in from the left side of the bar, next to the black-haired girl\u2014the obstacle, as Mystery would say. Page 97 85 \"Hi,\" I rasped. I cleared my throat. \"I'm the friend Sasha was telling you about. So what clubs did you recommend?\" I could sense a silent sigh of relief from all parties that someone had come in to make things less awkward. \"Well, Reka is a fun place for dinner,\" the black-haired girl said. \"And along the waterfront there are some great boats, like Lukas, Kruz, and Exil. Underground and Ra are fun too, though they're not the kinds of places I go to.\" \"Hey, as long as we're talking, I want to get your opinion on some\u00ad thing.\" I was on familiar ground now. \"Do you think spells work?\" By now, I was getting used to telling the spells opener\u2014a story about a friend who fell in love with a woman after she surreptitiously cast an attrac\u00ad tion",
  "38": "spell on him. So while my mouth moved, my brain thought strategy. I needed to reposition myself next to the Bo Derek blonde. Yes, I was going to steal my student's girl. It's not like he had a chance with her anyway. When I finished, I said, \"I'm asking because I never believed in that stuff before, but I had an amazing experience recently. Here\"\u2014I addressed the blonde\u2014\"let me show you something.\" I maneuvered myself around to the other side of their stools, so that I was next to my target. Page 98 86 Now that I was one-on-one with her, I still needed to sit down; other\u00ad wise she'd eventually get uncomfortable with me lurking over her. However, there weren't any open stools, so I'd have to improvise. \"Give me your hands,\" I told her, \"and stand up for a moment.\" As soon as she stood, I wheeled around behind her and slid into her seat. Now I was finally in the set, and she was lurking awkwardly on the out\u00ad side. This was the science of approaching perfectly executed, like a good game of chess. \"I just stole your chair,\" I laughed. She smiled and punched me teasingly in the arm. The game had begun. \"I'm just kidding,\" I continued. \"Stay close. We'll try an ESP experiment. But I can only stay for a moment. Then you can have your chair back.\" Even though I guessed her number wrong (it was ten), she still enjoyed the process. As we talked afterward, Mystery walked up to Sasha and told Page 99 87 him to keep the black-haired woman occupied so she wouldn't pull my tar\u00ad get away. Marko was right: The girls were gorgeous here. They were also extremely bright and, much to my relief, spoke better English than I did. I truly en\u00ad joyed listening to this girl; she was captivating, well-read, and had an MBA. When it came time to leave, I told her it would be great to see her again before I left. She pulled a pen from her purse and gave me her phone num\u00ad ber. I could feel Mystery's approval\u2014and the students' acceptance. Style was the real deal. Sasha was still talking to the black-haired girl, so I whispered in his ear, \"Tell her we have to go, and ask for her e-mail.\" He did and, lo and behold, she gave it to him. We rejoined the group and left the cafe. Sasha was a new man. Flushed with excitement, he skipped down the street like a little boy, singing in Ser\u00ad bian. He was being, in his own awkward way, himself. He'd never gotten a girl's e-mail address before. \"I'm so happy,\" Sasha raved. \"This is probably the best day of my life.\" As anyone who regularly reads newspapers or true-crime books knows, a significant percentage of violent crime, from kidnappings to shooting sprees, is the result of the frustrated sexual impulses and desires of males. By socializing guys like Sasha, Mystery and I were making the world a safer place. Mystery threw his arm around my neck and pulled my face into his wiz\u00ad ard's overcoat. \"You've done me proud,\" he said. \"It's not just about getting the girl. It's about the students seeing it happen and believing it can be done.\" It was then that I realized the downside to this whole venture. A gulf was opening between men and women in my mind. I was beginning to see women solely as measuring instruments to give me feedback on how I was progressing as a pickup artist. They were my crash-test dummies, identifi\u00ad able only by hair colors and numbers\u2014a blonde 7, a brunette 10. Even when I was having a deep conversation, learning about a woman's dreams and point of view, in my mind I was just ticking off a box in my routine marked rapport. In bonding with men, I was developing an unhealthy attitude to\u00ad ward the opposite sex. And the most troubling thing about this new mind\u00ad set was that it seemed to be making me more successful with women. Marko drove us to Ra, an Egyptian-themed nightclub guarded by two concrete statues of Anubis. Inside, it was nearly empty. There were just se- Page 100 88 curity guards, bartenders, and a group of nine noisy Serbians clustered on barstools around a small circular table. We were about to",
  "39": "leave when Mystery spied, among the group of Ser\u00ad bians, a lone girl. She was young and slender with long black hair and a red dress that showed off a set of perfectly tapered legs. It was an impossi\u00ad ble set: She was surrounded by stocky guys with crewcuts. These were men who had clearly been in the military during the war, men who had proba\u00ad bly killed before, maybe even with their bare hands. And Mystery was go\u00ad ing in. The pickup artist is the exception to the rule. \"Here,\" he told me. \"Clasp your hands together. And when I say so, act as if you can't open them.\" He pretended, through the art of illusion, to seal my hands together. I pretended to be amazed. The commotion attracted the attention of the bouncers in the club, who asked him to try the feat with their hammy fists. Instead, Mystery per\u00ad formed his watch-stopping illusion for them. Soon, the club manager was giving him free drinks and the table of Serbians had halted their conversa\u00ad tion and were gawking at him, including his target. \"If you can make a girl envy you,\" Mystery told the students, \"you can make a girl sleep with you.\" Two principles were at work. First, he was generating social proof by earning the attention and approval of the club staff. And, second, he was pawning\u2014in other words, he was using one group to work his way into an\u00ad other, less approachable group nearby. For his coup de grace, Mystery told the club manager he would levitate a beer bottle. He approached the table of Serbians, asked to borrow an empty bottle, and made it float in the air in front of him for a few seconds. Now he was in his target's group. He performed a few illusions for the guys and ignored the girl for the requisite five minutes. Then he relented, started talking to her, and isolated her to a couch nearby. He had pawned the entire club just to meet her. Since the girl spoke only a little English, Mystery used Marko as a translator. It was a longer set than usual, because Mystery needed to con\u00ad vince her that he wasn't practicing any form of witchcraft or black magic. \"Everything you've seen tonight is fake,\" Mystery finally told her, via Marko. \"I created all this to meet you. It's a social illusion.\" Page 101 89 The two finally exchanged numbers\u2014\"I can't promise you anything other than good conversation,\" Mystery instructed Marko to tell her\u2014and we collected the students to leave the club. However, on our way out, an AMOG from the table blocked Mystery's path. He wore a tight black T-shirt, exposing a physique that made Mystery's doughy body look femi\u00ad nine in comparison. \"So you like Natalija, magic man?\" he asked. \"Natalija? We're going to be seeing each other. Is that okay with you?\" \"She's my girlfriend,\" the AMOG said. \"I want you to stay away from her.\" \"That's up to her,\" Mystery replied, taking a step closer to the AMOG. Mystery wasn't backing down. He was an idiot. I looked at the AMOG's hands and wondered how many Croatian necks he had snapped in his day. The AMOG lifted his waistband, exposing the black handle of a pistol. \"So, magic man, can you bend this?\" This was no invitation; it was a threat. Marko turned to me, panicked. \"He's going to get us killed,\" he said. \"Most of the guys at these clubs are ex-soldiers and mobsters. Killing some\u00ad one over a girl is nothing for them.\" Mystery waved his hand over the AMOG's forehead. 'You saw me move that beer bottle without touching it,\" he said. \"It weighs eight hundred grams. Now imagine what I could do to one tiny brain cell in your head.\" He snapped his fingers to indicate the pop of a brain cell. The AMOG looked Mystery in the eyes to see if he was bluffing. Mys\u00ad tery held his eye contact. One second passed. Two seconds. Three. Four. Five. It was killing me. Eight. Nine. Ten. The AMOG lowered his shirt back over the gun. Mystery had the advantage here: No one in Belgrade had ever seen a magician perform live before. They'd only been exposed to magic on televi\u00ad sion. So when Mystery disproved in an instant",
  "40": "the belief that magic was just camera tricks, an older belief replaced it: the superstition that just maybe magic is real. The AMOG stood there, silent, as Mystery walked out unscathed. Page 102 Some girls are different. That's what Marko thought. After everything he'd seen during Mys\u00ad tery's workshop, he was in no way a convert. Goca wasn't like those other girls, he insisted. She came from a good family, she was well-educated, and she had morals, unlike that materialistic club trash. I'd heard it all before from dozens of guys. And I'd heard just as many intelligent women say, \"That wouldn't work on me,\" when I told them about the community. Yet minutes or hours later, I'd see them exchanging phone numbers\u2014or saliva\u2014with one of the boys. The smarter a girl is, the better it works. Party girls with attention deficit disorder generally don't stick around to hear the routines. A more perceptive, worldly, or educated girl will listen and think, and soon find herself ensnared. And so it was that Mystery and I found ourselves out on New Year's Eve with Marko and his one-itis, Goca. Marko put on a gray suit, picked her up at 8:00 P.M., ran around and opened the car door for her, and handed her a dozen roses. She seemed like a bright, successful, well-bred girl. She was short with long chestnut hair, gentle eyes, and a smile that arced just a little wider on one side. Marko was right: She did look like the marrying kind. The restaurant was traditional Serbian fare, heavy on the red peppers and red meat. And the music was pure anarchy: Four brass bands wandered the rooms, blaring a cacophony of overlapping parade marches. I watched Marko and Goca carefully all night, curious to see if this whole dating thing worked. They sat next to each other awkwardly. Their interaction consisted only of the necessary formalities of the evening: the menu, the service, the at\u00ad mosphere. \"Ha ha, wasn't that funny when the waiter gave you my steak?\" The tension was killing me. It wasn't as if Marko was a natural. In grade school he'd never been that popular, largely on account of being foreign, having the nickname Pump\u00ad kinhead, and joining the Young Republican Club. By the time he had grad\u00ad uated, he was probably worse off than I was: At least I'd kissed a girl. Page 103 91 In college, he began taking steps toward relations with the opposite sex He purchased a leather jacket, invented an aristocratic background for himself, put Terence Trent D'Arby braids in his hair, and bought his first Mercedes-Benz. The effort earned him some attention, even a few female friends. But it wasn't until junior year that he was finally comfortable enough around women to start removing clothes with them, thanks largely to a younger student he befriended: Dustin. The taste of those first small victories was so sweet that Marko stayed in college for three more years, basking in his hard-won popularity. One of Marko's more peculiar habits is that he takes hour-long show\u00ad ers every night. No one has ever come up with a plausible explanation of what he does in there, because nothing makes sense\u2014masturbating, for ex\u00ad ample, doesn't take that long. If you have any theories, please send them to: ManOfStyle@gmail.com. After watching Marko sit uselessly next to Goca for an hour, I cracked. I grabbed my camera and ran Mystery's digital photo routine on the pair. I asked them to take a picture smiling, then one looking serious, and finally a passionate picture\u2014kissing, for example. Marko stuck his neck out toward her, chicken-like, and pecked. \"No, a real kiss,\" I insisted, concluding the routine as the two would- be betrothed's lips bumped in what was the clumsiest first kiss I had ever witnessed. After dinner, Mystery and I terrorized the two-room restaurant, danc\u00ad ing with the old men, performing magic tricks for the waiters, and flirting indiscriminately with the married women. When we returned to the table glowing, Goca's eyes met mine; for a moment they seemed to sparkle,",
  "41": "as if searching for something in my gaze. I could swear it was an IOI. That night, I was awoken by a warm body climbing under the covers. It was my turn to share the bed with Marko, but this wasn't Marko. It was a woman's body. I felt a pair of warm hands caress my newly shaven skull. \"Goca?!\" \"Shh,\" she said, and sucked my upper lip into her mouth. I pulled loose. \"But what about Marko?\" \"He's in the shower,\" she said. \"Did you and he...?\" \"No,\" she said with a contempt that surprised me. Goca and I had hit it off that night; so had Goca and Mystery. She had Page 104 92 made a pass at Mystery earlier, and he'd pretended not to notice. But it was harder not to notice her when she was in my bed, in my nostrils, in my mouth. Sure, she'd had a few drinks, but alcohol has never caused anyone to do something they didn't want to. It only enables them to do what they've always wanted but repressed. And right now it looked like Goca wanted to be with a man who possessed all six of the five characteristics of an alpha male. Logically, it's easy to say that it's wrong to sleep with a girl your friend is pursuing. But when her body is pressed against yours so submissively, and you can smell the conditioner in her hair (strawberry), and that storm cloud of passion created by her desire has begun gathering around the two of you, try saying no. It's just too ... right there. I ran my hands beneath her hair and slowly dragged my fingernails up\u00ad ward along her scalp. A shiver of pleasure ran through her body. Our lips met, our tongues met, our chests met. I couldn't do this. \"I can't do this.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of Marko.\" \"Marko?\" she asked, as if she'd never heard the name before. \"He's sweet, but he's just a friend.\" \"Listen,\" I said. \"You should go. Marko will probably be out of the shower soon.\" Fifty minutes later, Marko was out of the shower. I heard him and Goca arguing in Serbian in the hallway. A door slammed. Marko walked wearily into the room and collapsed onto his half of the bed. \"Well?\" I asked. He was never one to show much emotion. \"Well, I want to take Mystery's next workshop.\" Page 105 I couldn't bridge the fucking gap. There she was, my Bo Derek blonde with an MBA, sitting next to me on a couch at a cafe. Her thigh was grazing mine. She was playing with her hair. And I was wussing out. The great Style, the apprentice PUA whose magnetism was so strong that it made Marko look like an AFC to his own true love, was still too scared to kiss a girl. I had great opening game, but no follow through. I should have taken care of the problem before Belgrade. But it was too late. I was blowing it. I was scared of rejection, and of feeling uncomfortable afterward. Mystery, in the meantime, was getting along just fine with Natalija, who was thirteen years his junior. They had nothing in common, not even a language. But there they were, sitting together. His legs were crossed and he was leaning back, letting her work to get his attention. She was leaning into him, with her hand on his knee. I walked my date back to her house after coffee. Her parents weren't even home. All I had to say was, \"Can I use the bathroom?,\" and I could have been upstairs. But my mouth wouldn't speak the words. Countless success\u00ad ful approaches had helped reduce my fear of social rejection and made me seem like a promising pickup artist to others, but inside I knew I was just an approach artist. To become a PUA, there was a far-more-devastating mental obstacle I still needed to overcome: my fear of sexual rejection. In the course of my seduction research, I'd read Madame Bovary by Gus- tave Flaubert. And I remembered how much work and persistence it had taken the aristocratic dandy Rodolphe Boulanger de la Huchette to get just a kiss from the unhappily married Madame Bovary. But once he persuaded her to submit the first time, it was all over. She was obsessed. One of the tragedies of modern life is that women as a whole do not hold a lot of power in society,",
  "42": "despite all the advances made in the last cerr tury. Sexual choice, however, is one of the only areas where women are in\u00ad disputably in control. It's not until they've made a choice, and submitted to it, that the relationship is inverted\u2014and the man is generally back in a posi\u00ad Page 106 94 tion of power over her. Perhaps that is why women, to the frustration of men everywhere, are so cautious about saying yes. In order to excel at anything, there are always hurdles, obstacles, or challenges one must get past. It's what bodybuilders call the pain period. Those who push themselves, and are willing to face pain, exhaustion, hu\u00ad miliation, rejection, or worse, are the ones who become champions. The rest are left on the sidelines. To seduce a woman successfully, to inspire her to take the risk of saying yes, I would have to grow some balls and be willing to leave my comfort zone. And it was by watching Mystery win over Natalija that I learned this lesson. \"I just got a haircut,\" he told her as they left the cafe. \"I have itchy hairs on my neck. I want to take a bath. Come wash me.\" Natalija, predictably, said that seemed like a bad idea. \"Oh, okay,\" he told her. \"I gotta get going, because I need to take a bath. Bye.\" As he walked away, her face fell. The thought that she might never see him again seemed to flash through her mind. This is what Mystery calls a false takeaway. He wasn't really leaving; he was just letting her think he was. Mystery took five steps\u2014counting as he went\u2014then turned around and said, \"I've been living in a shitty apartment for the past week. I'm going to get a hotel room right there and take a bath.\" He pointed to the Hotel Moskva down the street. \"You can come with me or just get an e-mail from me in two weeks when I return to Canada.\" Natalija hesitated for a moment, then followed him. And that's when I realized the mistake I'd been making my whole life: to get a woman, you have to be willing to risk losing her. When I returned to the house, Marko was packing. \"I'm in shock,\" Marko said. \"I tried to do everything right. Goca was my last hope for all women.\" \"So what are you doing? Moving to a monastery?\" \"No, I'm driving to Moldova.\" \"Moldova?\" \"Yeah, all the most beautiful girls in Eastern Europe come from Moldova.\" \"Where's that?\" \"It's a tiny country that used to be part of Russia. Everything there is dirt-cheap. Just being American is enough to get you laid.\" My philosophy is, if someone wants to go to a country I've never heard Page 107 95 of and there's not a bloody revolution in progress there, I'm game. Life is short and the world is large. Between us, we didn't know a single person who'd ever been to Moldova or could even pronounce the name of its capital, Chisinau. So I couldn't think of a better reason to drive there. I like the idea of filling in a colored shape on a map with real fact, feeling, and experience. And traveling with Mystery would be a perk. We would have adventures everywhere, the kind I'd always dreamed about. Page 108 There are few moments in life as shot through with potential as that of hav\u00ad ing a car, a full tank of gas, a map of an entire continent spread out in front of you, and the best pickup artist in the world in your back seat. You feel like you can go anywhere you want. What are borders, after all, but check\u00ad points letting you know that you've reached a new stage in your adventure? Well, all this may be true most of the time, but let's say you're working at Rand McNally, finishing the latest edition of your map of Eastern Eu\u00ad rope. And let's say there's a tiny country bordering Moldova\u2014perhaps a renegade Communist state\u2014but no other government recognizes this country diplomatically, or in pretty much any other way. What do you do? Do you include the country on your map or not? A magician, a faux aristocrat, and I were driving across Eastern Europe when we quite accidentally discovered the answer to this question. It had been a fruitless drive so far. Mystery was",
  "43": "slumped in the back seat under\u00ad neath a blanket, unable to conjure his way out of a fever. Oblivious to the dramatic snowy Romanian landscape that passed by each day, he covered his eyes with his hat and complained. Every so often, he'd leap to alertness and disgorge the contents of his mind. And every time the contents of his mind were another map of sorts. \"My plan is to tour North America and promote my shows in strip clubs,\" he said. \"I just need to come up with a good illusion for strippers. You can be my assistant, Style. Imagine that: You and I touring strip clubs and taking all the girls to the show the next day.\" After a couple of uneventful days in Chisinau\u2014where the only beauti\u00ad ful women we saw were on magazine covers and billboards\u2014we figured, \"Why stop there?\" Odessa was so close. Maybe the adventure we were seek\u00ad ing lay further ahead. So we left Chisinau on a cold, snowy Friday and drove northeast to the Ukrainian border. The snow-blanketed roads out of the city were recogniz\u00ad able only by icy tire tracks stretching into the horizon. The vista looked like a scene from an epic Russian romance, with tree branches coated with crys\u00ad Page 109 97 tallized ice and frozen wine groves running along the hilly landscape. The car reeked of Marlboro smoke and McDonald's grease; every time it stalled, it became trickier to restart. But soon, all of that was the least of our problems. What looked on the map like a forty-five-minute trip to Odessa ended up taking nearly ten hours. The first sign that something unusual was afoot came when we reached a bridge over the Dniester River and found a military checkpoint complete with several army and police vehicles, camouflaged bunkers on either side of the road, and an immense tank with its barrel pointing in the direction of oncoming traffic. We stopped in a line of ten cars, but a military officer directed us around the queue and waved us through the checkpoint. Why? We will never know. Mystery wrapped himself tighter in his blanket in the back seat. \"I have a version of the knife-through-body illusion I want to do. Style, do you think you can dress up as a clown and heckle me from the audience? Then I'm going to bring you onstage and push you into a chair. I'll play 'Stuck In the Middle With You' from Reservoir Dogs while I put my fist straight through your stomach. I'll wiggle my fingers when they reach the other side. Then I'm going to lift you straight up, out of the chair, impaled on my arm. I need you to do that with me.\" The second sign that something was not quite right came when we stopped by a gas station to stock up on snack food. When we offered them Moldovan lei, they told us they didn't accept that currency. We paid in American dollars, and they gave us change in what they said were rubles. When we examined the coins, we noticed that each had a large hammer- and-sickle on the back. Even stranger, they had been minted in 2000: nine years after the Soviet Union had supposedly collapsed. Mystery pulled his hat down to just above his mouth, which was mov\u00ad ing with the grandiosity of a carnival barker. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he an\u00ad nounced from the back seat as Marko worked to start the car, \"he levitated over the Niagara Falls, he jumped off the Space Needle and survived... pre\u00ad senting superstar daredevil illusionist, Mystery!\" I guess his fever was breaking. As we drove on, Marko and I began to see Lenin statues and commu\u00ad nist posters through the car window. One billboard depicted a tiny sliver of land with a Russian flag on its left and, on its right, a red and green flag Page 110 98 with a slogan beneath. Marko, who spoke some Russian, translated it as a call for a Soviet Re-union. Where were we? \"Imagine this: Mystery the superhero.\" Mystery wiped his nose with a shredded tissue. \"There could be a Saturday morning cartoon, a comic book, an action figure, and a feature film.\" Suddenly, a police officer (or at least someone dressed as one) stepped into the road in",
  "44": "front of the car with a radar detector in his hand. We'd been driving ninety kilometers an hour, he told us\u2014ten over the speed limit. Af\u00ad ter twenty minutes and a two-dollar bribe, he let us go. We slowed down to seventy-five, but a few minutes later we were pulled over again. This officer also told us we were speeding. Though there were no signs, he claimed that the speed limit had changed half a kilometer back. Ten minutes and two dollars later, we were on our way again, crawling at fifty-five just to be safe. In short order, we were pulled over and told we were driving below the minimum speed. Wherever we were, it was the most corrupt country on earth. \"I need to figure out my ninety-minute show. It will begin with a raven flying into the audience and landing on the stage. Then\u2014boom\u2014it will turn into me.\" When we finally reached the border, two armed soldiers asked for our papers. We showed our Moldovan visas, and that was when we were told that we were no longer in Moldova. They showed us the local passport\u2014an old Soviet document\u2014and yelled something in Russian. Marko translated: They wanted us to drive back to the military checkpoint on the bridge we had crossed three police bribes ago and obtain the proper documents. \"I will dress as Mystery, with platform boots and the works. I won't wear suits anymore. I will be goth and club cool. I will tell the audience how as a child I'd play with my brother in the attic and dream about being a ma\u00ad gician. Then I'll go back in time and turn into a child.\" When Marko told a border guard there was no way we were going back to the bridge, he pulled out his gun and pointed it at Marko. Then he asked for cigarettes. \"Where are we?\" Marko asked. With pride, the guard answered back, \"Pridnestrovskaia.\" If you've never have heard of Pridnestrovskaia (or Trans-Dniester, in English), don't worry: neither had we. Trans-Dniester is neither recognized diplomatically nor mentioned in any of the guide books or maps we carried. Page 111 99 But when there's a border guard pressing a pistol into your waist, well, sud\u00ad denly Pridnestrovskaia seems very real. \"I'll do a science experiment where I transport a lab technician over the Internet. Then the finale will be a bank heist and cage vanish. So I need a male kid, a raven, you, someone to play the lab technician, and a couple people to be bank guards.\" Marko gave the guard his entire pack of Marlboros and started arguing with him. The guard didn't lower his gun once. After a long exchange, Marko yelled something and thrust out his hands as if asking to be hand\u00ad cuffed. Instead, the guard turned and disappeared into an office. When Marko returned to the car, I asked him what he had said. \"I said, 'Listen, just arrest me. I'm not going back.'\" This was getting ugly. Mystery thrust his head over the seat partition. \"Imagine this. A poster of just my hands, with black nails, and the word Mystery at the bottom. How amazing would that be?\" For the first time, I lost it with him. \"Dude, this is not the fucking time. Open your eyes.\" \"Don't tell me what to do,\" he snapped. \"We're about to get thrown in jail. No one wants to hear your shit right now. Does nothing exist except for you and your fucking magic show?\" \"Listen, if you want to go at it, I'll go at it,\" he thundered. \"I'll take you down right now. Just step out of the fucking car, and I'll deal with you.\" The guy was a foot taller than me, and the border crossing was full of armed soldiers. There was no way I was going to tangle with him. But I was angry enough to consider it. Mystery had been dead weight this entire trip. Maybe Marko was right: Mystery wasn't one of us. He hadn't gone to the Latin School of Chicago. I took a deep breath and stared straight ahead, trying to contain my rage. The guy was a narcissist. He was a flower that bloomed with attention\u2014 be it positive or negative\u2014and wilted when ignored. Peacock theory wasn't just to attract girls. It existed first and foremost to attract",
  "45": "attention. Even picking a fight with me was just another plea for attention, because I'd been ignoring him for the past hundred miles. When I glanced at the rearview mirror and saw him pouting in the back seat with his hat pulled over his eyes, however, I actually began to feel bad for him. \"I didn't mean to snap at you,\" I told him. Page 112 100 \"I don't like it when someone tells me what to do. My dad used to tell me what to do. And I hate him.\" \"Well, I'm not your dad,\" I said. \"Thank God for that. He ruined my life and my mom's life.\" He pulled his hat up. Tears lay over his eyes like contact lenses, unable to escape on their own. \"I used to lie in bed at night, thinking of ways to kill my dad. When I got really depressed, I'd imagine going to his bedroom with a shovel, smashing his head in, and then killing myself.\" He paused and wiped his eyes with the back of his gloved hand. \"When I think of my father, I think of violence,\" he continued. \"I remember seeing him punch people in the face when I was really young. When we had to kill our dog, he took a gun out and blew its head off right in front of me.\" The border guard emerged from an office and motioned for Marko to step out of the car. They spoke for several minutes; then Marko handed him several bills. While we waited to see if our bribe of forty dollars\u2014the equiva\u00ad lent of one month's salary in Trans-Dniester\u2014was effective, Mystery opened up to me. His father, he said, was an alcoholic German immigrant who verbally and physically abused him. His brother, who was fourteen years older than him, was gay. And his mother blamed herself for smothering his brother with love to make up for her husband's abuse. So, to compensate, she was emotionally distant from Mystery. When he was still a virgin at age twenty- one, he began to worry that maybe he was gay. So, in a bout of depression, he began formulating what would become the Mystery Method, dedicating his life to pursuing the love he never received from his parents. It took two more bribes of equivalent sum, spread between two other officials, to grease our way across the border. It was never enough for them just to accept the money. Each separate bribe took an hour and a half of dis\u00ad cussion. Maybe they were just trying to give Mystery and I more time to get to know each other. When we finally reached Odessa, we asked our hotel clerk about Trans- Dniester. She explained that the country was the result of a civil war in Moldova, triggered largely by former communist apparatchiks, military elite, and black berets who wanted to return to the glory days of the Soviet Union. It was a place with no rules\u2014the Wild West of the Eastern bloc and a country few foreigners dared to visit. When Marko told her about our experience at the border, she said, \"You shouldn't have asked them to arrest you.\" Page 113 101 \"Why?\" he asked. \"Because they don't have jails there.\" \"Then what would they have done with us?\" She shaped her fingers into a gun, pointed them at Marko, and said, \"Pow.\" When we returned to Belgrade, driving some five hundred miles out of our way to avoid Trans-Dniester, Marko's voice mail was full. Mystery's seventeen-year-old, Natalija, had left a dozen messages. Mystery phoned her back, but the call was intercepted by her mother, who cussed him out for hi\u00ad jacking her daughter's mind. Natalija continued to call Marko after Mystery and I flew home, asking when he was going to come back for her. Finally, Marko put her out of her misery. \"He was a wizard,\" he told her. \"He put a spell on you. Get some help and stop calling me.\" Marko e-mailed me constantly in the months that followed, asking for a password to Mystery's Lounge. He had tasted the forbidden fruit and wanted more.

For some reason, transitioning to the kiss is a big hurdle for me. I'll feel the window open, and then instantly I start thinking all the \"what-ifs\"\u2014\"what if she rejects me,\" \"what if I ruin the rapport we have,\" \"what about that thing she said about her ex-boyfriend.\" Then either I build up too much anxiety and go for it tentatively (and fuck up), or the window closes and I miss if and get pissed at myself.

Here is my routine. 1. I have her come over to pick me up and only let her stay a couple minutes.This is because it's a lot easier to get a woman back to your house at the end of the night if you've already had her over and nothing has happened. 2. At the end of the date, I invite her back to my place and pour drinks. 3. If she notices my guitar (it is prominently placed], I pick it up and play her a song. 4. We play with my puppy. 5. I show her the rooftop. 6. I bring her back to the apartment and show her the Winamp music program on my computer while I sit her down on my lap. While she's playing with the visualizations in Winamp, I kiss her on the cheek. 7. She either turns and kisses me on the lips, or she continues playing with Winamp. If she hesitates, I just show her more things on the computer and then kiss her on the cheek again. She wants to be directed and ordered about. That is what almost all women want. 8. You can figure out the rest. \u2014Maddash Page 116 104 MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Re: Sticking Point AUTHOR: Grimble One of my favorite closing routines is massage.

I waited a few seconds, then turned back and repeated, \"Bite me right here.\" This time, she did. It was cat-string theory in action. 5. However, her bite was lame. So I told her, \"That's not how you bite. Come here.\" Then I swept her hair aside, gave her a good bite on the neck, and instructed her to try again. This time, she did a great job. 6. I smiled approvingly and said, very slowly, \"Not bad.\" Then we finally kissed. We had a few more drinks, then I took her to my place. After a brief tour, I did a Maddash move and had her sit on my lap while showing her a video on the computer. I massaged and kissed the back of her neck until she turned around and started making out with me. Then she asked if she could lie on the floor for a second.

Or Mystery and the Mystery Method, in which social dynamics are ma\u00ad nipulated to snag the most desirable woman in a club. Or David DeAngelo and Double Your Dating, in which he advocates keeping the upper hand over a woman through a combination of humor and arrogance that he calls cocky funny. Or Gunwitch and Gunwitch Method, in which the only thing students have to do is project animalistic sexuality and escalate physical contact un\u00ad til the woman stops them. His crude motto: \"Make the ho say no.\" Or there's David X, David Shade, Rick H., Major Mark, and Juggler\u2014 the newest guru on the scene, who appeared online one day claiming he could pick up women better and faster than any other PUA simply by read\u00ad ing his grocery list. Then there are the inner-circle teachers, like Steve P. and Rasputin, who reveal their techniques only to those they deem worthy. Yes, there are plenty of mentors to choose from, each with his own methods and disciples, each operating under the belief that his way is the way. And the giants do battle constantly\u2014threatening, name-calling, de\u00ad bunking, competing. My goal was to feed from all of them. I've never been a true believer in anything. I've preferred to combine teaching and wisdom from various sources, find what applies to me, and discard what doesn't. The problem is that when you drink from the source of knowledge, there is a price. And that price is faith. Every single teacher wanted to know that he was the best, that his students were the most loyal, that the competition wasn't getting laid. Yet every single student wanted to absorb as much information from as many different experts as possible. It is a crisis that's specific not to the com\u00ad munity but to humanity: Power is retained by attracting loyalty, and subju\u00ad gation is guaranteed by giving it. Though I had enjoyed teaching in Belgrade, I didn't want followers. I Page 124 110 wanted more teachers. I still had a lot to learn. I found that out when Ex- tramask took me to a party at the Argyle hotel on Sunset Boulevard. I was dressed rakishly, in a black sport coat with long tails and a thin, shaped goatee. Extramask, meanwhile, looked better and more outrageous every time I saw him. He now had his hair cut and spiked into a four-inch Mohawk. At the party, I noticed a pair of heavily peacocked twins sitting on a couch like alabaster statues. Though their well-coiffed hair and matching vintage dresses earned them admiring looks; the girls didn't say a word to anyone all night. \"Who are they?\" I asked Extramask, who was talking to a petite moon\u00ad faced woman who seemed very interested in him. \"They're the Porcelain TwinZ,\" he said. \"They do a goth burlesque show together. They're also well-known groupies. They double-team band members. I've masturbated with my penis about them and blown spectacular loads.\" \"Introduce me.\" \"But I don't know them.\" \"That's okay. Introduce me anyway.\" Extramask walked over to the girls and said, \"This is Style.\" I shook their hands. They were surprisingly warm hands for girls who looked half-dead. \"We were just having a discussion about magic spells,\" I told them. \"Do you think spells work?\" I knew this was the perfect opener, because it was clear they believed in spells\u2014for some reason, most girls who strip or exploit their sexuality for a living do. Then I transitioned into the ESP number-guessing routine. \"Entertain us more,\" they cooed. I'd gone too far. \"I'm not a dancing monkey,\" I replied. \"Besides, I'm a guy. I need a few minutes to recharge.\" It was a line of Mystery's. They laughed on cue. \"I'll tell you what,\" I continued. \"I've shown you a couple of cool things. Why don't you teach me something?\" They had nothing to show me. \"I'm going to talk to some friends,\" I said. \"I'll give you five minutes to think of something.\" I wandered away and struck up a conversation with a",
  "50": "cherubic little punk named Sandy. Ten minutes later, the twins approached. \"We have something to teach you,\" they said proudly. I actually hadn't planned on speaking to them again. I didn't think Page 125 1ll they'd come up with anything. But they stood there and taught me sign lan\u00ad guage for five minutes. IOI. We sat down together and made small talk, which the PUAs refer to somewhat disparagingly as fluffing. The girls were easy to tell apart, be\u00ad cause one had chicken pox scars and the other had punctures in her face from removed piercings. They were visiting from Portland and planned to fly home the next day. They told me about their striptease show, in which they dance on stage and simulate lovemaking together. As we talked, I realized they were just ordinary, insecure girls. That's why they'd been so quiet. Most men make the mistake of believing that an attrac\u00ad tive woman who doesn't talk to or acknowledge him is a bitch. Most of the time, however, she's just as shy or insecure as the less attractive women he's ignoring\u2014if not more so. What made the Porcelain TwinZ different is that they tried to compensate for their inner plainness with outer ostentatious- ness. They were just sweet girls looking for a friend. And now they had found one. As we exchanged numbers, I felt the window open. But I didn't know whether to go for one twin, the other, or both. I couldn't figure out how to separate them, but I didn't know what to do to seduce them simultaneously either. I was stuck. So I excused myself and went to find to Sandy. As I talked to Sandy, she sidled up next to me. She seemed like she wanted something. So I did the evolution phase-shift routine, then pulled her into the bathroom to make out. I wasn't really attracted to her: I was just excited about being able to kiss women so easily now. I was already abusing my newfound power. When we emerged ten minutes later, the twins had left the party. I'd blown it once again by taking the easy road rather than pushing myself. I returned to my apartment in Santa Monica empty-handed. Mystery was sleeping on my couch, and I told him about my failure with the twins. Fortunately, the next day, I received a message from the girls. Their plane had been canceled, and they were stuck at a Holiday Inn near the airport. I still had a chance to redeem myself. \"What should I do?\" I asked Mystery. \"Invite yourself over. Just say, I'm coming over.' Don't give them any option.\" \"Then what happens when I'm in this weird hotel room with them? How do I get things started?\" \"Do what I always do. As soon as you walk in, run yourself a bath. Then Page 126 112 take off your clothes, get in, call the girls in to scrub your back, and take it from there.\" \"Wow. That's pretty ballsy.\" \"Trust me,\" he said. So I called the twins back that evening and told them I was coming over. \"We're just lying around in our sweats watching TV,\" they warned. \"No problem. I haven't showered or shaved in a month.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"No.\" So far, everything was going according to plan. I drove to the hotel, rehearsing every move in my head. When I walked in the room, they were lying on adjacent twin beds watching The Simpsons. \"I need to take a bath,\" I told them. \"My hot water at home isn't work\u00ad ing.\" It's not lying; it's flirting. I made small talk while the water ran. Then I turned the corner into the bathroom, left the door open, removed my clothes, and sat in the tub. I didn't want to use soap yet because it would make the water dirty. So I sat naked in the bathwater, trying to work up the courage to call the girls in. I felt so vulnerable sitting there pale, skinny, and naked. I needed to take Mystery's advice and start working out. A minute passed. Five minutes. Ten minutes. I could still hear The Simp\u00ad sons coming from the television set. The girls probably thought I'd drowned by now. I had to make my move. I'd hate myself if I didn't. I sat there for five more minutes until I finally mustered the courage to",
  "51": "stutter: \"Hey, can you help me sort of wash my back?\" One of the girls yelled something. There was silence, then whispering. I sat in the bathtub panicking, worried they wouldn't even come in. What a dumb thing to say. The only thing more embarrassing would be if they ac\u00ad tually came in, and saw me sitting here naked with my dick floating in the water like a lily pad. I thought of my favorite line from Ulysses, when sexually frustrated Leopold Bloom imagines his impotent manhood in the bath\u00ad water and calls it the limp father of thousands. And then I thought, if I was smart enough to quote James Joyce in the bathtub, why did I feel so stupid in front of these girls? Finally, one of the twins walked in. I'd been hoping for both, but beg\u00ad gars can't be choosers. With my back to her, I reached over the side of Page 127 113 the tub and handed her the soap. I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye. I straightened my spine so it didn't look too much like the dinosaur scales of Mr. Burns. She rubbed the soap in circles on my back. It wasn't erotic; it was workmanlike. I knew she wasn't turned on, and I hoped she wasn't grossed out. Then she wet the washcloth in the tub and wiped the soap off. My back was clean. Now what? I thought sex was supposed to automatically happen afterward. But she was just kneeling there, doing nothing. Mystery hadn't told me what I was supposed to do after asking them to wash my back. He'd just said take it from there, so I assumed the whole sex thing would unfold organically. He hadn't told me how to transition from a back scrub to a hand job. And I had no idea. The last woman to wash my back was my mother, and that was when I was small enough to fit in the sink. But now was the moment. Something had to be done. \"Urn, thanks,\" I told her. She walked out of the bathroom. Fuck. I'd blown it. I finished washing myself, climbed out of the bath, toweled off, and put my dirty clothes back on. I sat on the edge of the bed of the girl who had washed me, and we talked. I decided to try to adapt the evolution phase-shift pattern to a party of two. I told the other sister to sit on the bed with us. \"Mmm, you both smell so good,\" I began. Then I pulled their hair si\u00ad multaneously and bit each of their necks. But it still didn't get anything go\u00ad ing. They were both so passive. I had them each massage one of my hands as we talked about their stage show. I wasn't going to leave the room a failure. \"You know what's funny,\" one of them said. \"We get all our physicality out on stage. We never even touch or hug each other in real life. We're prob\u00ad ably more distant than most sisters.\" I left their hotel room, a failure. On the way home, I stopped by Extra- mask's house, where he lived with his parents. \"I'm confused,\" I told him. \"I thought you said they did guys together.\" \"Yeah, but I was just joking around. I thought you knew.\" Extramask had a date the following week with the moon-faced woman he'd been talking to at the party. Women with wide faces seemed to find him attractive. Page 128 114 We lay on the floor for two hours talking about the game and our progress. Since adolescence, whenever I'd had the opportunity to make a wish (on an eyelash, a digital clock at 11:11, an ever-increasing number of birthday candles), thrown in with the usual pleas for world peace and per\u00ad sonal happiness, I'd ask for the ability to attract any woman I wanted. I had fantasized about an incredible seductive energy entering my body like a lightning bolt, suddenly making me irresistible. But instead it was coming in a slow drizzle and I was running around underneath it with a bucket, working to catch each drop. In life, people tend to wait for good things to come to them. And by waiting, they miss out. Usually, what you wish for doesn't fall in your lap; it falls somewhere nearby, and you have to recognize it, stand up, and put in the time and work it takes to get to it. This isn't because the universe is cruel. It's because the",
  "52": "universe is smart. It has its own cat-string theory and knows we don't appreciate things that fall into our laps. I would have to pick up my bucket and work. So I took Mystery's advice. I got Lasik surgery, shedding my nerdy glasses once and for all. I paid to get my teeth laser-whitened. And I joined a gym and took up surfing, which was not only a cardiovascular workout but also a way to get tan. In some respects, surfing reminded me of sarging. Some days you go out and catch every wave and think you're a champ; other days you don't get one good wave and you think you suck. But no matter what, every day you go out and you learn and you improve. And that's what keeps you coming back. However, I hadn't joined the community just to get a makeover. I needed to complete my mental transformation, which I knew would be much more difficult. Before Belgrade, I had taught myself the words, skills, and body language of a man of charisma and quality. Now I needed to de\u00ad velop the confidence, self-worth, and inner game to back it up. Otherwise, I'd just be a fake, and women would sense it instantly. I had two months off until my next workshop with Mystery in Miami, and I wanted to really blow away the students there. I aimed to outdo Mys\u00ad tery's sarge at Club Ra in Belgrade. So I gave myself an assignment: to meet, in the next few months, every top PUA there was. I planned to make myself a seducing machine, designed from pieces of all the best PUAs. And now that I had some status in the community as Mystery's new wing, it would be easy to meet them. Page 129 The first person I wanted to learn from was Juggler. His posts intrigued me. He advised AFCs to overcome their shyness by trying to talk a homeless person into giving them a quarter or by calling people randomly out of the phone book to ask for movie recom\u00ad mendations. He told others to challenge themselves and intentionally make pickups more difficult by saying they worked as trash collectors and drove '86 Impalas. He was an original. And he had just announced his first workshop. The cost: free. One of the reasons Juggler rose so quickly in the community, besides his competi\u00ad tive pricing was his writing: His posts had flair. They weren't the disorganized scrawl- ings of a high school senior in perpetual conflict with his testosterone. So when I called Juggler to discuss using afield report of his in the book, he asked if he could write some\u00ad thing new instead: the story of the day he surged me at his first workshop in San Fran\u00ad cisco. FIELD REPORT\u2014THE SEDUCTION OF STYLE BY JUGGLER I clicked off the cell phone. \"Style talks really fast,\" I said to my housemate's cat, who understands these things and was my longstanding partner in crime when it came to getting girls to the house. (The offer of, \"Want to come back to my place and watch the cat do back flips?\" hardly ever failed.) That was my first impression of Style's real life persona. Two weeks later I sat in a restaurant in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf waiting for Style to arrive, mentally tallying a list of crazy things that could be wrong with him. I ignored the waiter who was trying to upgrade my beer and made a prayer to myself. \"Please, goddess of seduction and patron saint of pickup artists and guys trying to get nookie everywhere, please do not let Style be weird.\" Talking too fast is usually a sign of a deep lack of confidence. People who feel that others aren't interested in what they think talk fast for fear of losing the attention of their audience. Others are so in love with perfection that they have a difficult time editing it all down and continuously speed up in hopes of getting it all in. Such people usually become writers. That was it: weirdo or Page 130 116 writer. I hoped it was the latter. I needed a friend and equal in this world of seduction, not another student. I'd first heard of Style on the Internet. We had come to admire each other's postings on a website dedicated to the art of seduction. He wrote",
  "53": "with grace and eloquence. He seemed to be a positive guy who was focused on sharing. What he saw in my posts I can only guess. Style entered the room with a galloping lope. Were those platform shoes he was wearing? He made easy eye contact, beamed with a beautiful smile, and was a touch nervous in just the right amount to make him endearing\u2014an effect I'm sure was deliberate. With his relatively short stature, baby-like shaved head, and soft-spoken voice, no one would ever suspect him of being a pickup artist. I perked up. This guy could be good. I liked Style right away. He was obviously very practiced at making people like him. He made me feel important. He had a way of summing up many of my more clunkily expressed ideas into simple, beautiful statements\u2014all the while attributing the eloquence back to me. He was the perfect accomplice for an up-and-coming guru. And yet I wasn't sure what his weakness was. We all do that as we get to know someone. Like a tabloid editor, we search for both greatness and weakness, jotting notes in our heads for future exploitation. We are never comfortable with those who have no visible flaw. Style's softness was not real weakness. My only guess as to Style's flaw was a pride in his ability to get others to open up and reveal themselves. Pretty lame as far as a weakness goes but that was all I had to go on. He was a cool guy. But he had a lack of confidence that made no sense, as if he felt there was something missing about himself\u2014a piece that would make him complete. I was pretty sure he was searching for it outside when he would eventually find it inside. After lunch, we did exactly what all hot pickup artists on the make do in San Francisco. We went to the Museum of Modern Art. We walked downstairs and spread out\u2014commandoes of seduction. I turned a corner in the dimly lit new media section and noticed a cute twenty-year-old. She was small. I love petite women. There is something about their inherent weakness that turns me on. I joined her at a video projection on the floor. The scene looped every minute or so\u2014white petals falling delicately off seasoned branches. Height can be intimidating. I am the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz\u2014tall Page 131 117 and thin with bits of prickly straw sticking out of my sleeves. I sat down on the bench there. She relaxed. Our eyes touched\u2014hers almond green, mine blood\u00ad shot from jet lag. The best seductions happen when the woman seduces you. You have to lead to be a good seducer but you also have to follow. In that moment I realized I wanted her to take me by the hand to her secret camp in the woods. I wanted her to show me her goofy magic trick. I wanted her to read me the naughty poems she writes on coffee shop napkins. CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP. Style and his shoes were moving along the backside of the divider that bisected the long room. I didn't want him to join us. It is not that I didn't appreciate Style. He had me at a humble, \"Greetings, I am the one called Style.\" It was just that the vibe between her and me and the never-ending white petals was so . . . mesmerizing. And also because I am a wolf and this little doe separated from her herd was mine. If Style shows up, I might have to bite his face. The first thing you say to a woman matters very little. Some guys tell me they can't think of anything or they need a really good line. I tell them they are thinking too much. You are not that important. I am not that important. We have never thought a thought so great that it needs to be wrapped with so much care. Give up your need for perfection. As far as opening lines go, a grunt or a fart is sufficient. \"How are you?\" I asked. That is one of my usual openers. Just something you hear every day from the grocery store clerk. Ninety-five percent respond with a one-word, noncom\u00ad mittal answer: \"fine\" or \"okay.\" Three percent respond with enthusiasm: \"great\" or \"super.\" Those are the ones you learn to stay away from\u2014they're nuts. And two",
  "54": "percent respond with an honest, \"Terrible. My husband just left me for his yoga teacher's receptionist. How fucking Zen.\" Those are the ones you love. She tells me she is \"fine.\" Her voice is rough for such a small package. She must have been up late screaming at the Courtney Love concert. I am not really into the loud rock scene. I like elevator music. But I forgive her. I don't screen women. That would only limit my adventures. I only screen on how well I get treated. I look at her expectedly. She takes the hint. \"How are you?\" she asks. I ponder a moment. \"I'm an 8.\" I'm always an 8, sometimes an 8.5. There are two paths to move a conversation. You can either ask questions: Page 132 118 \"Where are you from?\"; \"How many ways can you curl your tongue?\"; \"Do you believe in reincarnation?\" Or you can make statements: \"I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan\u2014home to hundreds and hundreds of ice cream shops\"; \"I had a girlfriend who could curl her tongue into a poodle\"; \"My housemate's cat is the reincarnation of Richard Nixon.\" I spent my early twenties trying to get to know girls by asking tons of questions\u2014open-ended questions, smart questions, strange questions, the most heartfelt questions wrapped in beautiful boxes. I thought they would appreciate my interest. All I got was name, rank, serial number, and sometimes the finger. Interrogation is not seduction. Seduction is the art of setting the stage for two people to choose to reveal themselves to each other. Talking in statement form is the way old friends speak to each other. Statements are the mode of the intimate, the confident, and the giving. They invite others to share and make perfect metaphysical sense. Trust me on that\u2014 you do not have to spend nights lying in the grass, staring up into our spread-eagled Milky Way galaxy figuring it all out. I have done it for you. \"This video makes me feel peaceful,\" I said. \"Like raking leaves into a big pile and falling into them. But if they had some actual leaves here that we could play in\u2014now that would be art.\" She smiled. \"I got thrown in the leaves a lot by my older brothers when I was growing up.\" I chuckled. The thought of this tiny girl being tossed gleefully into a huge pile of leaves was funny. 'You know,\" I said, \"I have a friend who swears he can figure out a person's personality based on the age and sex of their siblings.\" \"Like having older brothers makes me butch?\" She adjusted her Harley- Davidson belt buckle. \"That is so much bullshit.\" You can't lead without being able to follow. \"Crazy bullshit,\" I agreed. \"The guy is completely wigged out. Of course, he did read me exactly.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, he knew I had one older sister. Just like that.\" \"How did he know?\" \"He said I was needy.\" \"Are you?\" 'Yes, of course. All my girlfriends have to write me love notes and give me backrubs. I'm high maintenance.\" Page 133 119 She laughed musically. It was like the soundtrack to falling leaves. CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP. Focus is passe. In the modern world we want to feel everything all the time. There is no point in just taking a walk in the park when we can also listen to headphones, munch on a hot dog, crank up our vibrating soles to the maximum, and check out the passing carnival of humanity. Our choices shout the creed of a new world order: stimulation! Thought and creativity have be\u00ad come subservient to the singular goal of saturating our senses. But I'm old school. If you are not prepared to focus on me when you are with me\u2014 conversation, touch, our momentary entwining of souls\u2014then get out of my face and go back to your 500 channels of surround-sound life. \"Look, I can't talk to you anymore.\" \"Why not?\" \"I am enjoying this but you either have to commit to talking with me or go look at art. And, besides, with you standing there I'm going to get a crick in my neck.\" She smiled and joined me on the bench. Ah. CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP. \"I'm Juggler.\" \"I'm Anastasia.\" \"Hi Anastasia.\" Her",
  "55": "tiny hand felt calloused. Her nails were trimmed short. They were the hands of a worker bee. I needed to investigate fully. I pulled her closer. She came willingly. CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP. Style entered the scene. His perfume wisped and his Italian fabric rustled. Did he flourish? It felt like he flourished. What was wrong with him? Couldn't he see I was enjoying an intimate moment with this girl? Was he so focused on some sort of entertainment phase of seduction that he couldn't see we were beyond that? My moment with this girl evaporated. A growl built deep in my chest. \"Do I know you?\" I asked him. \"Does anyone truly know anyone?\" Style retorted. He made me laugh. Damn him to hell\u2014in that moment I hated Style for his mischievous timing but loved him for his way with words. I decided not to bite his face\u2014this day. I could tell Style was eager to demonstrate himself in action. I introduced Page 134 120 the two of them. Then something freaky happened. Style's eyes rolled back in his head, and he became someone else. My best guess as to whom he was channeling was Harry Houdini\u2014a fast-talking Harry Houdini. He performed tricks. He had her punch him in the stomach. He mentioned sleeping on a bed of nails. She was enjoying herself. Her phone number appeared out of thin air. That was good enough for Harry. We left her where I found her. There is pride involved in being a pickup artist. It is a challenge. I have performer friends who can explode on stage (ike samurai and kill five hundred people, but they are afraid to approach a girl in a bar. I don't blame them. Most audiences are horny to be fucked. They want it hard and deep. But the girl sitting on the barstool is more difficult. She is scarier. She is the five hundred pound gorilla in a little black dress. And she can bust you up, if you let her. But she is also horny to be fucked. We are all horny to be fucked. San Francisco was my first group workshop. I had booked six guys. We met up with them at a restaurant near Union Street. Style helped me quickly check their credentials. They were six members in good standing of the community. We spent dinner making up conversation starters, such as the pretend- someone-is-a-movie-star opener. On the way back from the restroom, I ap\u00ad proached a good-looking middle-aged couple at a nearby table. \"I hope I am not interrupting,\" I said to the woman, \"but I just had to tell you that I loved you in that one with the boy and the lighthouse. It made me cry for three days. I stayed up late watching if with my housemate's cat. He used to be the president.\" They nodded and smiled amicably \"You . . . thank . . . very much,\" the woman responded in broken English. \"It is great.\" \"Where are you from?\" I asked. \"Czechoslovakia.\" I gave her a hug and shook the man's hand. \"Welcome to America.\" Pickup artists are the only real diplomats left in the world. I didn't start out as a pickup artist. I began as a small boy obsessed with taking things apart. I carried a screwdriver everywhere. I had a burning desire to know firsthand how things worked. Toys, bicycles, coffee makers\u2014 everything comes apart if you know where the screws are. My dad would go to cut the grass, but the lawnmower would be in pieces. My sister would switch on the television . . . and nothing. All the vacuum tubes were under my bed. I was much better at taking things apart than putting them back together. My family was reduced to living in the Stone Age. Page 135 121 Later my research shifted toward understanding people and myself. I became a variety act\u2014juggler, street performer, comedian. It's the backwater of entertainment, but a great place to learn about human interaction. As a side effect, I became good with women. By my twenty-third birthday, I had slept with only one woman. By my twenty-eighth, I could sleep with as many as I wanted. My approach became subtle and efficient, my game graceful and compact. Then I found the community. Although",
  "56": "my interest was much broader than just seduction, their dedication to understanding human interaction was like coming home. Then I met Style and felt a kinship on an entirely new level. Style listened. Most people don't listen because they are afraid of what they might hear. Style had no preconceived notions. He was cool with however anyone wanted to be. He didn't find bitchy girls who had to be broken. He found feisty girls who were fun to play with. He didn't see a path of random obstacles. He saw an opportunity to explore new territory. Together we were the Lewis and Clark of seduction. When the workshop ended at 3:00 A.M., Style and I decided to share a hotel room with some of his family who were in town. We talked in hushed voices so as not to wake them. I teased Style's fashion sense. He made fun of my midwestern sensibilities. We shared stories from our experiences with the community and counted up the loot\u2014a couple of kisses for Style, a couple of telephone numbers for me. The mood was giddy. We felt on the edge of something. \"It's really amazing, man,\" Style said. \"I can't wait to see where all this leads.\" He was so full of wide-eyed optimism in the power of pickup, in the benefits of self-improvement, in the belief that we\u2014the community\u2014had the answer to the problems that had plagued him his whole life. I wanted to tell him that the answer he was seeking lay elsewhere. But I never got around to it. We were having too much fun. Page 136 When I returned home from San Francisco, where the only person I spent the night with was Juggler, I received a phone call from Ross Jeffries. \"I'm having a workshop this weekend,\" he said. \"If you want, you can come sit in for free. It's at the Marina Beach Marriott hotel on Saturday and Sunday.\" \"Sure,\" I told him. \"I'd love to go.\" \"There's just one thing: You owe me parties. Good Hollywood parties with hot chicks. You promised me.\" \"Got it.\" \"And, before we hang up, you can wish me a happy birthday.\" \"It's your birthday?\" \"Yes, your guru of gash is forty-four. And my youngest this year was twenty-one.\" I had no idea he was inviting me to his seminar not as a student, but as a conquest. I arrived on Saturday afternoon to find a standard hotel conference room, the kind that's so brightly lit and mustard yellow it seems designed as a habitat more for salamanders than for human beings. Rows of men sat behind white rectangular tables, facing the front of the room. Some were greasy-haired students, others were greasy-haired adults, and a few were greasy-haired dignitaries\u2014top-ranking officials at Fortune 500 companies and even the Justice Department. In the front was our porous, bony guru of gash, talking into a headset. He was telling the students about the hypnotic technique of using quotes in a conversation. An idea is more palatable, he explained as he paced the room, if it comes from someone else. \"The unconscious thinks in terms of content and structure. If you introduce a pattern with the words, 'My friend was telling me,' the critical part of her mind shuts off. Do you follow me?\" He looked around the room for a response. And that was when he no\u00ad ticed me, sitting in the back row between Grimble and Twotimer. He stopped speaking. I felt the heat of his glare on me. \"Brothers, this is Style.\" Page 137 123 I smiled wanly. \"He has seen what Mystery has to offer and decided to be\u00ad come my disciple. Isn't that right, Style?\" Every greasy head in the room turned to look at me. The reviews of Mys\u00ad tery's Belgrade workshop had hit the Internet, and my skills in the field had been soundly praised. People were curious to meet Mystery's new wing\u2014or, in Ross's case, to own him. I stared at the thin black headset coiling around his face like a spider. \"Something like that,\" I said. That was not enough for him. \"Who is your guru?\" he asked. It was his room. But it was my mind. I didn't know what to say. Since the best way to deflect pressure is with humor, I tried to think of a joke re\u00ad",
  "57": "sponse. I couldn't come up with one. \"I'll get back to you on that,\" I answered. I could see that he wasn't happy with my response. After all, this wasn't just a seminar he was running. It was a cult. When the meeting broke for lunch, Ross pulled me aside. \"Why don't you join me for some Italian?\" he asked, twirling his ring, a replica of the one worn by the superhero Green Lantern. \"I wasn't aware that you were still a big supporter of Mystery,\" he said over lunch. \"I thought you had come over to the good side of the force.\" \"I don't think your two methods have to be mutually exclusive. I told Mystery what you did with the waitress at California Pizza Kitchen, and he flipped out. I think for the first time, he saw how Speed Seduction could re\u00ad ally be effective.\" Ross's face turned purple. \"Stop!\" he said. It was a hypnosis word, a pattern interrupt. \"Do not share anything with him. I don't want that guy taking my best work, stealing it, and making money off it. This is disturb\u00ad ing.\" He stabbed a fork into his chicken. \"I knew something was wrong. If you're going to be this deeply involved with Mystery, then I'm going to have a problem. If you're going to learn privately with me, I forbid you from telling him the details.\" \"Listen,\" I tried to appease the angry guru. \"I haven't told him anything in detail. I just let him know that you were the real deal.\" \"Fine, then. Just tell him you saw me get a chick hot as hell and wetting her panties just by asking a couple of questions and making some gestures. Let the arrogant fuck figure it out for himself!\" I watched his nostrils flare and the veins in his forehead bulge as he Page 138 124 spoke. He was clearly a guy who'd been beaten down early in life. Not by the brutality of his father like Mystery; Ross's parents were a smart, good- humored Jewish couple. I knew because they'd arrived at the seminar a few minutes after me and instantly started teasing him. Rather, Ross had been beaten down socially, which probably took a great toll on his psyche when combined with the constant teasing and high expectations of his parents. His siblings must have been overwhelmed as well. His two brothers had turned to God and became Jews for Jesus. As for Ross, he had turned to to a religion of his own making. \"You are being led into the inner sanctum of power, my young appren\u00ad tice,\" he warned, wiping the gray stubble on his chin with the back of his hand, \"and the price for betrayal is dark beyond measure of your mortal mind. Keep quiet and keep your promises, and I will keep opening the door.\" Ross's severity and anger, though unconscionable, were understand\u00ad able. The fact was that Ross had built the seduction community almost single-handedly. Sure, there'd always been a stable of men giving pickup ad\u00ad vice, like Eric Weber, whose book How to Pick Up Girls helped start the trend that culminated in the movie The Pick-Up Artist with Molly Ringwald and Robert Downey Jr. But there had never been a community of guys before Ross. The reason was fortuitous timing. As Speed Seduction was develop\u00ad ing, so was the Internet. In his twenties, by all accounts, Jeffries was an angry man. His ambi\u00ad tion was stand-up comedy and screenwriting. One of his scripts, They Still Call Me Bruce, was even produced, but it flopped. So Jeffries drifted be\u00ad tween paralegal jobs, lonely and girlfriendless. That all changed when he was in the self-help section of a bookstore and his hand, he claims, invol\u00ad untarily reached out and grabbed a book. That tome was Frogs Into Princes, the classic book on NLP by John Grinder and Richard Bandler. Ross went on to devour every book on the subject he could find. One of his heroes had always been the Green Lantern, who was en\u00ad dowed with a magic ring able to bring the desires of his will and imagina\u00ad tion to life. After using NLP to end a long streak of involuntary chastity by seducing a woman who'd applied for a job in the law office where he worked, Ross Jeffries believed he had",
  "58": "found that ring. The power and con\u00ad trol that had eluded him his whole life was finally his. His professional pickup career began with a seventy-page self- Page 139 125 published book. The title pretty much summed up where he was coming from emotionally at the time\u2014How to Get the Women You Desire Into Bed: A Down and Dirty Guide to Dating and Seduction for the Man Who's Fed Up With Being Mr. Nice Guy. He sold the book through small classified ads in the back of Playboy and Gallery. When he added seminars to his repertoire, he began marketing on the Internet as well. One of his students, a legendary com\u00ad puter hacker named Louis DePayne, soon created the newsgroup alt.seduc- tion.fast. Out of that forum, an international cabal of PUAs gradually came into being. \"When I first came out with this stuff, I was savagely ridiculed,\" Ross said. \"I was called every name in the book and accused of the worst things. I was really angry for a while. Very pissed off. But gradually the argument went from 'Is this real?' to 'Should they be doing it?'\" And that is why every guru owes at least a pledge of allegiance to Ross Jeffries. He laid the groundwork. It's also why every time new teachers pop up, Ross tries to shoot them down; in a few cases, he has even threatened to reveal a young competitor's online seduction activities to his parents or school administration. Worse than Mystery, in his mind, was a former Speed Seduction stu\u00ad dent named David DeAngelo. Originally, DeAngelo called himself Sisonpyh\u2014hypnosis spelled backward\u2014and worked his way into the Speed Seduction hierarchy. But the two of them had a falling out when Ross supposedly hypnotized a girlfriend of DeAngelo's into fooling around with him. According to Ross, DeAngelo had brought the girl to him to seduce. It wasn't uncommon, he said, for students to bring him women as a sacrifice of sorts. According to DeAngelo, Ross was in no way given permission to touch the girl. Whatever the case, the result was that the two stopped speaking and DeAngelo set up a rival business called Double Your Dating. It was based not on NLP or any other form of hypnosis, but rather on evo\u00ad lutionary psychology and DeAngelo's principle of cocky funny. \"You know, my cheapjack imitator David DeAnushole is having his first seminar in L.A.,\" Ross said. \"The guy is so fucking good-looking and well-connected in the nightclub scene it just astounds me that people think he could ever understand their situation and the difficulties they encounter in dealing with women.\" I made a mental note to sign up for the seminar. Page 140 126 \"There's a certain view of women that David DeAnushole, Gun Bitch, and Misery have,\" Ross continued, working himself into a rage. \"These guys are focusing on the worst tendencies of some of the worst women out there and spreading it like a cloud of fertilizer on all women.\" Ross reminded me of an old rhythm-and-blues artist who has been ripped off so much that he trusts no one. But at least there are publishing companies and copyrights in place to protect songwriters. There is no way to copyright a woman's arousal, to declare certain authorship over her choice of a partner. His paranoia, sadly, made sense\u2014especially when it came to Mystery, the only seducer with the ideas and skills to supplant him. The waiter cleared our pasta. \"I am so passionate about this because I care about these kids,\" Ross was saying. \"I think that 20 percent of my stu\u00ad dents have been abused. They have been severely impacted. Not just with women but with all people, male and female. And a lot of problems in soci\u00ad ety come from the fact that we all have such strong drives, but live in a cul\u00ad ture that discourages us from exploring them freely.\" He turned around and noticed three businesswomen eating dessert a few tables away. He was about to freely explore his sex drive. \"How's that berry cobbler?\" Ross yelled at them. \"Oh, it's good,\" one of the woman replied. \"You know,\" Ross said to them, \"people have",
  "59": "signal systems for dessert.\" He was off and running. \"The signals say: This is sugar-free; this melts in my mouth. And the signal system fires up your body's responsive\u00ad ness to get ready for what comes next. It's tracing an energy flow through your body.\" He had the women's attention now. \"Really?\" they asked. \"I teach courses in energy flow,\" Ross told them. The women ooohed in unision. The word energy is the equivalent of the smell of chocolate to most women in Southern California. \"We were just talking about whether men really understand women. And we think we've figured it out.\" In a flash, he was at their table. As he spoke, the women forgot com\u00ad pletely about their dessert and stared at him rapt. I couldn't tell sometimes if his patterns really worked on the sophisticated subconscious level he claimed, or if most conversations were so boring that simply saying some\u00ad thing different and intriguing was enough to trigger attraction. \"Oh my God,\" one of the women said when he finished running a pat- Page 141 127 tern about the qualities women look for in a man. \"I've never heard it said like that before. Where do you teach? I'd love to know more.\" Ross collected her phone number and returned to the table. He turned to me, smiled, and said, \"Now do you see who's teaching the true way?\" Then he rubbed his thumb on his chin. Page 142 In Sin's eyes, I was a pawn. \"Ross is a seductionist and a plotter,\" he said when I called him in Montgomery, Alabama, where he'd been stationed. He was living with a girl he'd met who liked being taken out on the end of a leash and collar. Unfor\u00ad tunately, the military frowned on such perversions, so Sin had to drive all the way to Atlanta to walk her on the downlow. \"You have a special place in Ross's plans,\" he warned. \"You are the mar\u00ad keting tool he's using to attack Mystery. You are Mystery's first and best student, the only guy who's sarging regularly with him. So every time Ross asks you a question like, 'Are you lying to your guru?,' and you answer, the presupposition that he's your guru is affirmed. Every little thing he does is to prove you are a convert and you've disavowed your old religion to em\u00ad brace the true one that actually works. That is his message. So be careful.\" There was a catch to learning NLP, manipulation, and self- improvement. No action\u2014whether yours or another's\u2014was devoid of in\u00ad tent. Every word had a hidden meaning, and every hidden meaning had weight, and every weight had its own special place on the scale of self- interest. However, as much as Ross may have been nurturing a friendship with me in order to crush Mystery, he also had a reputation for befriending younger students just so they'd take him to parties. I invited Ross to his first event the following week. Monica, a struggling but well-connected actress I'd sarged, had invited me to her birthday party at Belly, a tapas bar on Santa Monica Boulevard. I thought it would be a good scene full of beautiful people for Ross to dazzle with his skills. I was wrong. I met Ross at his parents' place, a middle-class red brick house on the west side of L.A. His father, a retired chiropractor, school principal, and self-published novelist, sat on a couch near his mother, who clearly wore the pants in the family. On the wall were a purple heart and a bronze star that Ross's father had won during World War II in Europe. \"Style's very successful,\" Ross told them. \"He gets a lot of chicks using my material.\" Even pickup artists in their forties still seek the approval of their parents. Page 143 129 I talked to his mother for a while about her son's line of work. \"Some people think if he talks about sex and women, it's terrible,\" his mom said. \"But he's not crude and vulgar. He's a very bright boy.\" She stood up and ambled to a wall of shelving. \"I have a book of poetry he wrote when he was nine years old. Do you want to read some of it? One of them says he's a king and he's on a throne.\" \"No, you don't want to read that,\"",
  "60": "Ross interrupted. \"Jesus Christ, this was a mistake. Let's get going.\" The party was a disaster. Ross couldn't handle himself around classy people. He spent most of the night thinking he was flirting by acting as if he were my gay lover and crawling on all fours behind Carmen Electra, pre\u00ad tending to be a dog sniffing her ass. When I was talking to another girl, he interrupted to brag about a pickup he had just done. At 10:00 P.M., he said he was tired and demanded that I drive him home. \"Next time, we should stay later,\" I said. \"No, next time we have to arrive at the right time,\" he scolded me. \"I can stay out late, provided I get about twelve hours notice so I can take it easy and nap in the afternoon.\" \"You're not that old.\" I made a mental note never again to take Ross anywhere cool. It was an embarrassment. Since I'd started spending so much time with PUAs, I'd lowered my standards for people I hung out with. All my old friends had fallen by the wayside. Now my social life was monopolized by a caliber of nerd I'd never associated with before. I was in the game to have more women in my life, not men. And though the community was all about women, it was also completely devoid of them. Hopefully, this was just part of the process, the way cleaning a house often makes it messier first. For the rest of the drive back to his apartment in Marina del Rey, Ross harangued me about his rivals. Of course, Ross's detractors weren't any kinder to him. They had recently nicknamed him Mine '99, claiming that whenever Ross took someone else's tactic and made it his own, he liked to insist it was something he had developed at his 1999 Los Angeles seminar. \"That traitorous creep David DeAnushole,\" Ross seethed as I dropped him off. \"His seminar is tomorrow, and I just found out some of my stu\u00ad dents are scheduled to speak. They didn't even have the courtesy to let me know.\" I didn't have the heart to tell Ross that I'd be going also. Page 144 Attraction is not a choice. Those were the words David DeAngelo had projected on the wall. The seminar was packed. There were more than a hundred and fifty people in the room. Many of them I recognized from other seminars, including Extramask. It was getting to be an all-too-familiar sight: a person onstage with a headset instructing a group of needy men on how to save themselves from nightly onanism. But there was a difference. DeAngelo was a good-looking guy, like Ross Jeffries had said. He reminded me of Robert DeNiro, if DeNiro had been a mama's boy who'd never been in a fight in his life. DeAngelo stood out from the other gurus precisely because he didn't stand out. He wasn't charismatic or interesting. He didn't have the crazy gleam of a wanna-be cult leader or some gaping hole in his soul that he was trying to fill with women. He didn't even claim to be good at the game. He was very ordinary. But he was dangerous because he was organized. He had clearly spent months working on his seminar. It was not only entirely scripted but cleaned up for mass consumption. It was a school of pickup instruction that could be presented to the mainstream without shocking anyone with its crudeness, its attitude toward women, or the devi- ousness of its techniques\u2014except, that is, for his recommendation of read\u00ad ing the book Dog Training by Lew Burke for tips on handling girls. DeAngelo was a bright guy\u2014and a threat to Ross. Many of the speakers at his seminar were, like himself, Ross's former students: among them Rick H., Vision, and Orion, an uber-nerd who was famous as the first PUA to sell videotapes of himself approaching girls on the street. This video series, Mag\u00ad ical Connections, was considered hard evidence that nerds with hypnosis skills could get laid. \"Seduction,\" DeAngelo read from his notes, \"is defined in the diction\u00ad ary as an 'enticement to wrongdoing, specifically the offense of inducing a woman to consent to unlawful sexual intercourse by enticements which overcome her scruples.'\" \"In other",
  "61": "words,\" he continued, \"seduction implies tricking, being dis\u00ad Page 145 131 honest, and hiding your motives. That is not what I am teaching. I'm teach\u00ad ing something called attraction. Attraction is working on yourself and im\u00ad proving yourself to the point where women are magnetically attracted to you and want to be around you.\" Not once did DeAngelo mention the names of his competitors and ri\u00ad vals. He was too smart for that. He was going to try to take this whole un\u00ad derground world up for air, and he was going to do it by not acknowledging the underground world at all. He had stopped posting online and, instead, let his employees stick up for him when he was flamed. He wasn't a genius or an innovator like Mystery and Ross. But he was a great marketer. \"How do you make someone want something?\" he asked, after making his students practice giving each other James Dean underlooks. \"You give it value. You show that others like it. You make it scarce. And you make them work for it. I want you to think about other ways during lunch.\" I joined DeAngelo and some of his other students for a burger and found out a little more about him. A struggling real estate agent from Eu\u00ad gene, Oregon, he moved to San Diego for a fresh start. Lonely, he yearned to cross that invisible barrier separating two strangers at a club. So he began searching the Web for tips and cultivating friends who were good with women. One of those friends was Riker, a Ross Jeffries protege who turned him onto using America Online to meet women. Sending instant messages was a way for DeAngelo to practice flirting the way his new player friends did, but without risking public embarrassment. \"That was the chi\" he said as students milled about awkwardly, trying to overhear. \"I was learning new ideas, implementing them, and then notic\u00ad ing how women responded on AOL. That's when I learned that busting women's balls and really slamming them immediately didn't have the effect that the intuitive mind would guess it would. So I became cocky and funny. I stole their lines, teased them, accused them of hitting on me, and never gave them a break.\" Flushed with his new findings, DeAngelo delivered a fifteen-page screed to Cliff's List, one of the most established online seduction newslet\u00ad ters. The then-nascent seduction community ate it up: A new guru had ar\u00ad rived. Cliff, the middle-aged Canadian businessman who ran the list by day and hunted for new master PUAs to bring into the community by night, helped convince DeAngelo to spend three weeks turning his manifesto into an e-book, Double Your Dating. Page 146 132 While we were talking, Rick H. joined us. He was one of the friends DeAngelo had cultivated and was now his roommate in the Hollywood Hills. I'd heard a lot about Rick H. He was supposed to be the best, a master PUA who specialized in bisexual women. His garish style of dress, like that of a Vegas lounge lizard, was one of the inspirations for Mystery's peacock theory. Rick H. was short, slightly stocky, and dressed in a large-collared shirt and a red blazer. Trailing behind him were six attraction adepts eager to soak up his wisdom. I recognized two of them: Extramask, whose eyes were swollen nearly shut, and Grimble, who was beginning to have doubts about his application of Speed Seduction. Hypnotizing women into being groped in clubs wasn't getting him any girlfriends. So after spending time with Rick H., Grimble had turned cocky funny. His new approach was to stick his elbow out whenever a woman walked past, bump her, and then yell \"owwww\" loudly, as if she'd hurt him. When she stopped, he'd accuse her of grabbing his ass. It was much more rewarding, he realized, to be funny in a bar than creepy. Rick took a seat at the table and spread himself out comfortably. While students crammed around him, he began holding court. He had two rules for women, he said. The first: No good deed goes unpunished. (A phrase, ironically, that was coined by a woman, Clare Boothe",
  "62": "Luce.) The second: Always have a better answer. One of the corollaries of Rick's second rule was to never give a woman a straight answer to a question. So if a woman asks what you do for a living, keep her guessing: Tell her you're a cigarette lighter repairman or a white slave trader or a professional hopscotch player. The first time I tried this, it didn't go so well. In a five-set in a hotel lobby one night, a woman asked what my job was. I told her the response I had written on my cheat sheet for the night: white slave trader. As soon as the words left my mouth, I realized I probably wasn't going to get a number-close. Everyone in the set was African-American. One thing I noticed as Rick talked was that people who liked the sound of their own voice tended to do better with women\u2014except for soft-spoken Dustin. Cliff, of Cliff's List, called it big mouth theory. \"Why is this shit so fun to talk about?\" Rick H. asked DeAngelo. \"Because we're guys,\" DeAngelo said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Page 147 133 \"Oh, yeah,\" Rick said. \"That's what we do.\" When the gurus left, I sat with Extramask. He was sipping apple juice from a small can. He had a barbell-shaped piercing in the back of his neck now and if it weren't for his swollen eyes, he would have been the coolest looking guy at the seminar. \"What happened to you?\" I asked. \"I went out with that moon-faced girl and got my second lay ever,\" he said. \"But even though we fucked three times, I didn't blow my load again. Either condoms fucking suck or I have mental anxiety and need to calm down\u2014or Mystery's right and I'm a homo.\" \"But what does that have to do with your eyes? Did she punch you?\" \"No, she had a feather pillow or some shit, and I got an eye infection be\u00ad cause of my allergies.\" He said he met her for coffee. They sat together and he ran the ESP test, a psychological game called the cube, and other demonstrations of value. When she started laughing at all his jokes\u2014even the ones that weren't funny\u2014he knew she liked him. They rented the movie Insomnia, went back to her house, and cuddled together on the couch. \"I had a pretty legit boner going on,\" he said, matter-of-factly. \"You know, that kind of rock-hardness where you get the pre-cum dabbing your Underoos.\" \"I know. Do go on.\" \"And it was cool because one of her legs was pressed up against my juicy, rock-hard cock. She definitely felt the hardness. I took off my shirt, and she started kissing me and feeling my chest. It was cool.\" He paused and took a sip of apple juice through a narrow straw. \"Then I took her shirt off, so she was wearing just a bra. I felt her boobies. But when we went to the bedroom, I had a problem.\" \"An erection problem?\" \"No. She still had her bra on.\" \"So what's the problem? Just take it off.\" \"I have no clue how to take off bras. So I just left it on.\" \"I guess unhooking a bra is something you learn from experience.\" \"I have a plan, though. Want to hear it?\" \"Urn, sure.\" \"What I'm going to do is take one of my mom's bras and tie it around a pole or something. Then I'm gonna walk toward the pole blindfolded like in pin the tail on the donkey, reach the bra, and try to undo it.\" Page 148 134 I gave him a funny look. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not. \"I'm dead serious,\" he said. \"It's a legit way to learn, and you know it'll work too.\" \"How was the sex this time?\" \"It was like last time. I fucked her beyond belief, for probably a half hour straight. I was very hard and luscious. But I couldn't spunk a load. I hate this shit. Seriously, I really want to blow it during sex.\" \"You're probably thinking about it too much. Or maybe you're just not into the girls, emotionally.\" \"Or maybe I just adore the tight grip I use for masturbating,\" he said, rubbing his eyes. \"I think I got my first blow job, too. Like, I saw her head near my penis, and I couldn't tell whether she was sucking or not. But it was cool when my balls were licked.\" Grimble walked by and clapped a hand",
  "63": "on my shoulder. \"The seminar's starting again,\" he told me. \"Steve P. and Rasputin are speaking, and you definitely don't want to miss them.\" I stood up and left Extramask at the table, alone with his apple juice. \"You know what else I did?\" he yelled after me as I left. \"I fingered her!\" I turned back to look at him. He made me laugh. He pretended to be so confused and helpless, but maybe he was smarter than all of us. \"The inside of a vagina isn't at all what I thought it would feel like,\" he shouted excitedly. \"It feels very organized.\" Maybe not. Page 149 Though David DeAngelo taught the seminars on cocky funny, the undisputed heavy\u00ad weight of the genre was a forty-year-old Canadian writer known as Zan. Where PUAs like Mystery advocated going under the radar, Zan flaunted the fact that he was a ladies' man. He considered himself a seducer in the tradition of Casanova and Zorro, and enjoyed dressing up as them for costume parties. In four years on the seduction boards, he never once asked for advice; he only gave it. MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Zan's Cocky Funny Waitress Technique AUTHOR: Zan One thing I have going for me is that I am fearless around women. My method is very simple. Every single thing a girl says or does to me is an IOI. Period. She wants me. It doesn't matter who she is. And when you believe that, they start to believe it too. I am a slave to my love of women. They can sense it. The weakness of women is language and words. Fortunately, that is one of my strong points. If they try to repel my advances, I act like they are from Mars and what they are saying doesn't make any sense. I never try to defend myself or apologize for being a womanizer. Why? Because a reputation is attractive to women. It's true. I am the other man who guys worry about when they marry a girl. So with that in mind, I'd like to share with you today my patented cocky funny waitress technique: Usually when a group of guys is confronted with a new and devastatingly pretty waitress, they stare at her ass when she walks by, then talk about her be\u00ad hind her back. But when she comes to their table, they become downright cour\u00ad teous and nice and act like they are not interested in her. Instead, I go cocky funny immediately. I am going to be very detailed in my description of what I do because I think some guys don't really understand cocky funny role-playing. Page 150 136 When I see her conning toward us, I immediately engage a buddy across the table in seemingly deep conversation. I make sure to face my body away from her. When she comes up and asks us what we would like to drink, I ignore her for a few seconds or so. Then I glance in her direction and pretend I am just now seeing her for the very first time. Immediately, I show great interest in her\u2014as if she were a new discovery. I glance quickly at her body, just long enough for her to notice, then turn myself fully around to face her. A big smile and a wink, and the game begins. HER: What can I get for you? ZAN: [Ignoring the question] Hello, I haven't seen you around before. What's your name? HER: My name is Stephanie. What's yours? ZAN: I'm Zan. And I will have a gin and tonic. (Big smile) So far I've broken the ice a bit and, by exchanging names, she has given me the implicit right to be more familiar with her. So the next time she comes around, I smile and wink again. ZAN: You again? Wow, you sure like to hang around us, don't you? HER: [Laughs] (some stuff) ZAN: (Some other stuff) HER: (Some other stuff) ZAN: (As she is leaving) I bet you'll come back again real soon. I can see it in your eyes. HER: (Smiling) Yeah, I can't resist. Now I have established a cocky funny theme\u2014her wanting to hang around us and that is why she keeps coming back to our table. Of course, she has to come back to our table: She's the waitress. And when she does, I smile at her and give the other guys a knowing look in front of her as if to say, \"See, I was right.\" All along, I strive to make the",
  "64": "interaction come off like I have known her for a long time. This establishes a level of familiarity that usually takes several meetings to build. So now, after a while, I will say something like: HER: Can I get you another drink? Page 151 137 ZAN: (Smile, wink) You know what? You're kinda cute. I think I'm going to call you. HER: You think so, huh? You don't have my number. ZAN: Why, you're right! Okay, tell me and I will write it down. HER: [Smiling) Not a good idea. I have a boyfriend. ZAN: (Pretending to write) Whoa, slow down. I didn't quite catch your number there. You better repeat it for me. Lets see . . . 555 . . . HER: (Laughs and rolls her eyes) The absurdity of this exchange is that there is no way she is going to give me her phone number in front of a bunch of my friends. No girl would. But her dig\u00ad its are not the goal just yet. Now she and I have a rapport, in a manner of speaking. And I've made myself memorable enough that the next night we go there, she'll recognize me. This way, I can walk up, put my arm around her, and continue with my usual 'You would make a good girlfriend for me\" talk. And since everything is said in a half-joking manner, she doesn't know if I'm really hitting on her or if I'm just fooling around. So when I return: HER: (Laughing) Oh no! Not you again! ZAN: Stephanie, my sweet! Hey, listen, sorry I didn't return your call last night. You know how it is. I'm just a busy guy. HER: (Playing along) Yeah, I'm really mad about that. This gets the whole table laughing, including her. And its back on again for the evening. Later ZAN: You know what, Stephanie. You're a terrible girlfriend. In fact, I can't even remember the last time we had sex. That's it. We're through. ZAN: (Pointing to another waitress) She's going to be my new girlfriend. HER: (Laughing) ZAN: [Playing with my phone] You are now downgraded from Booty Call #1 to Booty Call # 10. HER: (Laughing) No, please, I'll do anything to make it up to you. And later still: Page 152 13B ZAN: [Motioning for her to come over and pointing at my knee] Stephanie, come and sit down. I'll tell you a bedtime story. [Smile, wink] I have used that last line for years. It is gold. Some of you guys are probably thinking, \"Okay, now what? How do you transition from funny ball-busting to more serious, romantic, sexual talk?\" It's simple, actually. At some point, I just talk to her quietly alone. Remem\u00ad ber to turn on the bedroom eyes. ZAN: [No longer cocky funny] Stephanie, do you want me to call you? HER: You know I have a boyfriend. ZAN: That's not what I asked. Do you want me to call you? HER: Tempting, but I can't. ZAN: Sneak away with me, girl. I'll take you higher up the slopes of Par\u00ad nassus than you have ever been. Etc. Everything you just read actually happened last Thursday and Friday evening with me and a waitress named Stephanie. She was easily the hottest thing around in a long time. The jury is still out on this one, but she has no illusions about my intentions. My friends she views as nice guys, but not me. She knows that any interaction with me is going to be passionate from the start. And now she can choose to accept it or reject it. The truth is, she may very well reject my overtures. But it doesn't matter. She won't soon forget me. And you can bet that the other waitresses know all about the things I said to her. And that is very good, especially since I have said almost the exact same things in the exact same way to all the other wait\u00ad resses there. And I will continue to do so\u2014right in front of Stephanie. The net effect is social proof. When you go in, you own the place. You wave the waitresses over, point to your cheek, and say, \"Hey, girl, where's my sugar?\" No one is intimidated because you treat them all the same way. In this particular restaurant, there are four waitresses who have come home with me, three less attractive waitresses who want to come home with me, and several more who are works-in-progress (including Stephanie).",
  "65": "And you can bet they all know about each other. But, again, that is very good. \u2014Zan Page 153 The highlight of the seminar was an appearance by two people who would give me my much-coveted inner game and more: Steve P. and Rasputin. These were guys I'd heard whispered about in the seduction community since I'd joined\u2014the true masters; leaders of women, not men. The first thing they did when they walked onstage was hypnotize every\u00ad body in the room. They both talked at the same time, telling different stories\u2014one to occupy the conscious mind and the other to penetrate to the subconscious. When they woke us up, we had no idea what they had in\u00ad stalled in our heads. All we knew was that these were two of the most confi\u00ad dent speakers we'd ever seen. Every ounce of fire and charisma that DeAngelo lacked, they possessed in bulk. Wearing a leather vest and an Indiana Jones hat, Steve P. was equal parts Hell's Angel and Native American shaman. Rasputin was a strip club bouncer with mutton-chop sideburns who looked like a steroid-jacked Wolverine. The two had met in a bookstore while both reaching for the same NLP book. Now they worked as a team and were among the most powerful hypnotists in the world. Their advice on seducing women was simply: \"Become an expert in how to feel good.\" Toward that end, Steve P. had figured out a way to get women to pay to have sex with him. For anywhere from several hundred to a thousand dol\u00ad lars, he trained women to have orgasms from a single vocal command; he taught them five different stages of deep throat he had devised; and, most fantastically, he claimed to give hypnotic breast enlargements, which he said could make a woman jump as much as two cup sizes. Rasputin's forte was what he called hypnotic sexual engineering. Sex, he explained, must be viewed as a privilege for the woman, not a favor to you. \"If a woman wants to give me a blow job,\" he elaborated, \"I tell her, 'You only get three sucks. And you may only go down as far as you receive pleasure.'\" His chest stuck out like the top of a Volkswagen. \"Afterward, I tell her, 'Didn't that feel nice? Next time, you get five sucks.'\" \"What if you're scared of getting caught trying to manipulate her?\" Page 154 140 asked a businessman in the front row who looked like a miniature Clark Kent. \"There is no such thing as fear,\" Rasputin replied. \"Emotions are just energy and motion that you trap inside your body because of a thought.\" Mini-Clark Kent stared at him stupidly. \"Do you know how you get over it?\" Rasputin looked at his interlocu\u00ad tor like a wrestler about to break a folding chair in half. \"You don't shower or shave for a month, until you smell like a sewer. Then you walk around for two weeks wearing a dress and a goalie mask with a dildo strapped to the front. That's what I did. And I will never be afraid of public humiliation again.\" \"You have to live in your own reality,\" Steve cut in. \"I had a girl once tell me I was kind of pudgy. I said, 'Well, if that's what you think, you don't get to pat the Buddha belly or ride the jade stalk.'\" He paused, then added as an afterthought, \"But I said it in a gentle fucking way, on the spiritual fucking path.\" Afterward, DeAngelo introduced me to the pair. The top of my head came up to Rasputin's Volkswagen. \"I'd love to learn more about what you do,\" I said. \"You're nervous,\" Rasputin said. \"Well, you two are a little intimidating.\" \"Let me get rid of that anxiety,\" Steve offered. \"Tell me your phone number backward.\" I started saying, \"Five ... four ... nine ... six.\" As I did, Steve snapped his fingers. \"Okay, take a deep breath and now blow out hard,\" he commanded. As I did, Steve traced his fingers up from my navel and made a whoosh\u00ad ing sound. \"Be gone!\" he commanded. \"Now watch that feeling just blow away like a smoke ring on a windy day. Notice how it's gone; it's no more. Take a tour of your body and try and find where it was. Notice how there's a different vibration there. Okay. Open your",
  "66": "eyes. Try really hard to bring any piece of it back. See? You can't.\" I couldn't tell whether it had worked or not, but I was reeling. He'd def\u00ad initely taken my mind and body on some kind of one-minute trip. He took a step back and scanned my face, as if reading a diary. \"A guy named Phoenix offered to pay me two thousand dollars to follow me around for three days,\" Steve P. said. \"And I told him no, because he wants Page 155 141 to make women his slaves. You seem like you may care about women: You don't just want to stuff your meat bat in some hole. You're willing to ex\u00ad plore shit.\" Suddenly, we heard a commotion behind us. Two sisters and their mother had made the mistake of walking down a hotel hallway full of pickup artists, and the vultures were descending on the carrion. Orion the uber-nerd was reading one of the girls' palms; Rick H. was telling the mother that he was Orion's manager; Grimble was moving in on the re\u00ad maining girl; and a crowd of wanna-be PUAs had gathered around, trying to see the masters at work. \"Listen,\" Steve P. said, in a rush. \"Here's my card. Call me if you ever want to learn some inner-circle shit.\" \"I'd love to.\" \"But this is classified,\" he warned. \"If we let you in, you cannot share these techniques with anybody. They're very powerful, and in the wrong hands they could really screw a girl up.\" \"Got it,\" I said. He twisted a piece of white paper into the shape of a rose, then bounded off in the direction of the carrion. He approached the girl Grimble was sarging, told her to smell the flower, and within thirty seconds she was passed out in Steve's arms. This was inner-circle shit. And I was about to learn it. Page 156 And so began the weirdest phase of my education. Every weekend, I'd drive two hours south to San Diego and stay at Steve P.'s small, squalid apartment, where he raised two sons the same way he talked to his students\u2014with compassionate obscenity. His thirteen-year- old was already a better hypnotist than I would ever be. In the afternoons, Steve and I drove to see Rasputin. They'd sit me in a chair and ask what I wanted to learn. I had a list: to believe that I was at\u00ad tractive to women; to live in my own reality; to stop worrying about what other people thought of me; to move and speak with an air of strength, con\u00ad fidence, mystery, and depth; to get over my fear of sexual rejection; and, of course, to attain a sense of worthiness, which Rasputin defined as the belief that one deserves the best the world has to offer. It was easy to memorize routines, but mastering inner game after a life\u00ad time of bad habits and thought patterns was not easy. These guys, however, had the tools to fix me in time for Mystery's next workshop in Miami. \"We're going to reframe you to where you're not glad to have some boopsy sucking your dick,\" Steve explained. \"It will be a privilege for her to get to drink from the nectar of the master.\" At each session, they'd put me under, and Rasputin would tell complex metaphorical stories into one of my ears as Steve P. issued commands to my subconscious in the other ear. They'd leave open loops (or unfinished meta\u00ad phors and stories) in my mind that they'd close a week later. They'd play music designed to elicit specific psychological reactions. They'd put me into trances so deep that hours went by in the blink of an eye. Afterward, I'd go back to Steve's house and read his NLP books while he screamed lovingly at his kids. I have a theory that most naturals, like Dustin, lose their virginity at a young age and consequently never feel a sense of urgency, curiosity, and in\u00ad timidation around women during their critical pubescent years. Those who must learn to meet women methodically, on the other hand\u2014like myself and most students in the community\u2014generally suffer through high Page 157 143 school without girlfriends or even dates. Thus, we're forced to spend years feeling intimidated by and alienated from women, who hold in their sole possession the key to",
  "67": "releasing us from the stigma blighting our young adult lives: our virginity. Steve fit in with my theory on naturals. He was initiated into sex when he was in first grade. An older girl wanted to give him a blow job; he re\u00ad sponded by trying to hit her with a rock. But she eventually convinced him, and the experience set off a lifelong obsession with oral sex. When he was seventeen, he said, a cousin hired him to work in the kitchen of a Catholic girls' school. After he gave oral sex to one of the girls, word spread and he soon became the sexual go-to guy on campus. In addition to giving the girls pleasure, however, he also gave them guilt. And after a few too many con\u00ad fessions that involved the boy in the kitchen, Steve was fired. He ran with a bike gang for a while but left soon after accidentally shooting a guy in the nuts. He now devoted his life to a self-styled mix of sexuality and spirituality. And for all his crude talk, he was at heart a good person. Unlike many of the other gurus I'd met, I trusted him. After Steve's kids went to sleep each night, he taught me inner-circle magic he'd learned from shamans whose names he'd sworn never to pro\u00ad nounce. The first weekend I stayed over, he gave me a lesson in soul-gazing, which is when you look deep into a woman's right eye with your own right eye as you breathe together. \"Once you do this with her, she's going to bond real strong with you,\" he warned. His cautionary speeches were often longer than the actual teach\u00ad ing process. \"When you do this, you become anamchara, which in Gaelic means friend of the soul. A soul friend.\" The following weekend I learned about m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois management, and how to train a woman to eat another woman's pussy by having her put a dried nectarine in her mouth and chew erotically on it during sex. The next weekend he showed me how to throw chi through my hands into a woman's abdomen. And the next weekend he taught me to contain and cy\u00ad cle orgasmic energy, so that a woman can stack one withheld orgasm on top of another\u2014until, as Steve P. put it, she's \"shaking like a dog shitting peach seeds.\" Finally, he shared what he considered to be his greatest skill: guiding any woman, through words and touch, to a powerful orgasm that \" gushes like Niagara Falls.\" This was a whole new level of game. He was giving me super powers. Page 158 144 I was in a whirlwind of learning. I didn't call my friends. I barely talked to my family. I turned down every writing assignment that came my way. I was living in an alternate reality. \"I told Rasputin,\" Steve said one night, \"that more than all the other se\u00ad duction boys out there, I'd like you to become one of our trainers.\" It was an offer I'd have to turn down. The seduction world was a palace of open doors. Walking through one, no matter how tempting the treasures inside, would mean having to shut the rest. Page 159 I returned home one Sunday night from San Diego to find a message on my machine from Cliff, of Cliffs List. He was in town, and he wanted to take me to meet his latest PUA discovery\u2014a biker turned construction worker who called himself David X. Cliff had been in the community since its inception. He was in his for\u00ad ties and was as nice as he was uptight. Though he was conventionally hand some, he was also the living embodiment of the word square. He looked like he'd stepped out of a 1950s family sitcom. He had a closet in his home, he claimed, with more than a thousand pickup books. There were issues of the Pick-Up Times, a short-lived magazine from the seventies; an original edition of Eric Weber's classic How to Pick Up Girls; and misogynist obscurities with titles like Seduction Begins When the Woman Says No. David X was one of half a dozen PUAs Cliff had discovered over the years and promoted on his list, which he'd started in 1999 after Ross criti\u00ad cized him on the Speed Seduction mailing list for discussing a pickup tech\u00ad nique that wasn't related to NLP. Every PUA had a specialty, and",
  "68": "David X's was harem management\u2014juggling relationships with multiple women without lying to them. When we walked into the dim sum restaurant, I was shocked by what I saw waiting for me. David X was quite possibly the ugliest PUA I'd ever met. He made Ross Jeffries look like a Calvin Klein underwear model. He was im\u00ad mense, balding, and toadlike, with warts covering his face and the voice of a hundred thousand cigarette packs. My meal with him was like so many I'd had before. Except the rules were always different. His were: I. Who cares what she thinks? II. You are the most important person in this relationship. His philosophy was to never lie to a female. He prided himself on bed\u00ad ding women by trapping them with their own words. For example, on meet\u00ad Page 160 146 ing a girl at a bar, he'd get her to say that she was spontaneous and didn't have any rules; then, if she was reluctant to leave the bar with him, he'd say, \"I thought you were spontaneous. I thought you did what you wanted.\" He spread out in his chair like a melting shard of Swiss cheese and in\u00ad formed us: \"The only lies I'll ever tell are: 'I won't come in your mouth' and 'I'll just rub it around your ass.'\" It wasn't a pretty visual. His philosophy was in direct contrast to what I had learned from Mys\u00ad tery, and he let me know it\u2014all through dinner. He was evidence of Cliff's big mouth theory, a natural alpha male. \"The best thing is,\" he boasted, \"there are guys like me and guys like you and Mystery out there. While you're still in the bar doing magic tricks, I'm coming back for seconds.\" It was an interesting dinner, and I learned a lot of little pieces of game I would go on to use scores of times. But by the time brunch was over, I'd re\u00ad alized something: I didn't need to meet any more gurus. I had every piece of information I needed to become the greatest pickup artist in the world. I had hundreds of openers, routines, cocky funny comments, ways to demonstrate value, and powerful sexual techniques. And I'd been hypno\u00ad tized to Valhalla and back. It wasn't necessary to learn anything else, unless it was for my own fun and interest. I just needed to be in the field constantly\u2014approaching, calibrating, fine-tuning, and working through sticking points. I was ready for Miami, and all the workshops to follow. As Cliff drove me home, I made a promise to myself: If I ever met a guru again, it would be not as a student but as an equal. Page 161 STEP 5 ISOLATE THE TARGET Page 162 IT IS UNFAIR TO TEAR SOMEBODY APART WHEN HER HEALTH AND EXUBERANCE THREATEN YOU. \u2014 JENNY HOLZER, Benches Page 163 As Mystery and I traveled the world doing workshops, meeting all the players in the game, the seduction community became more than just a bunch of anonymous screen names. It became a flesh-and-blood family. Maddash was no longer seven letters of type but a funny, Jeremy Piven-like entrepreneur from Chicago; Stripped was an uptight book editor from Amsterdam with male-model looks; Nightlight9 was a lovable nerd who worked for Microsoft. Over time, the posers and keyboard jockeys were outed, and the super\u00ad stars were given their due. And Mystery and I were the superstars because we delivered: Miami, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Montreal, San Fran\u00ad cisco, and Chicago. Every workshop made us better, stronger, more driven. All the other gurus I had met clung to the safety of the seminar room. They had never been forced to prove their teachings in the field city after city, night after night, woman after woman. Every time we left a city, a lair sprung up if one didn't exist already, bringing together students eager to practice their new skills. Through word of mouth, the lairs soon doubled, tripled, and quadrupled in size. And all these guys worshipped Mystery and Style: We were living the life they wanted, or so they thought. Each workshop generated more online reviews praising my newly ac\u00ad quired game. Each field report I posted triggered a flood of e-mails from students wanting to",
  "69": "be my wing. The list of sargers in my phone book was actually starting to surpass the number of girls I'd met. Most of the time when my phone rang, it was a guy asking for Style. And, dispensing with introductions, he'd ask, \"When you call a girl, should you block your number or not?\" or \"I was in a three-set, and the obstacle ended up liking me and giving me her phone number. Do I still have a chance with the target?\" The game was consuming my old life. But it was worth it, because it was part of the process of becoming that guy in the club\u2014the one I'd always en\u00ad vied, the one in the corner making out with a girl he'd just met. The Dustin. Before I discovered the community, the only time I'd ever made out with a girl I met in a club was when I first arrived in Los Angeles. But in Page 164 150 the middle of kissing, she pulled away and said, \"Everyone must think you're a producer or something.\" The subtext was that she was otherwise too hot to be making out with a slob like me. It shattered me for months. I was too insecure to handle what was, in retrospect, her own form of neg. But now, when I walked into a club, I felt a rush of power, wondering which woman would have her tongue down my throat within a half hour. For all the self-improvement books I had read, I still wasn't above shallow validation-seeking. None of us were. That's why we were in the game. Sex wasn't about getting our rocks off; it was about being accepted. Mystery, in the meantime, had gone through his own metamorphosis during our travels. He had developed a radical new form of peacocking. It was no longer enough to wear just one item to catch the attention of the opposite sex. Now, all his items were larger-than-life, turning Mystery into a mobile sideshow. He wore six-inch platform boots and a bright red tiger- striped cowboy hat, which combined to make him seven feet tall. He added skintight black PVC pants, futuristic goggles, a plastic-spiked backpack, a mesh see-through shirt, black eyeliner, white eye shadow, and as many as seven watches on his wrists. Every head turned as he walked down the street. He didn't need openers. The women opened him. Girls followed him for blocks. Some grabbed his ass; one older woman even bit his crotch. And all he had to do if he was interested was perform a few magic tricks, which seemed to justify his outlandishness. His new look also served as a great litmus test for women. It repelled the type of girl he wasn't interested in and attracted the type he was. \"I'm dressing for the outrageous club girls, the hot slutty girls, the ones I could never get,\" he explained one night when I accused him of looking like a clown. \"They're playing groupie, so I gotta play rock star.\" Mystery constantly encouraged me to dress as outlandishly as he did. Though I buckled one afternoon and bought a purple fur vest in a Mon\u00ad treal lingerie shop, I didn't get off on the constant gawking and attention. Besides, I was doing well enough without it. My reputation stemmed largely from the Miami workshop, where in a period of thirty minutes I put my previous six weeks of hypnosis, training, and guru-chasing into action. It was a night that would go down in the an\u00ad nals of community history. It was seduction not as wrestling but as ballet: a perfect example of form. It was the night of my official graduation from AFC to PUA. Page 165 It was the perfect sarge. When they walked into the VIP area of Miami's Crobar, everyone no\u00ad ticed. They were both platinum blondes with well-tanned fake breasts and identical outfits\u2014tight white tank tops and tight white pants. How could anyone not notice? They were what the PUAs would call perfect 10's, and they were dressed to turn men into beasts. This was South Beach, where testosterone levels run high, and the pair had been whistled and hollered at all night. The girls seemed to enjoy the attention almost as much as they sa\u00ad vored shooting down the men who gave it to them. I knew what to do\u2014and that was to do",
  "70": "what everyone else wasn't doing. A pickup artist must be the exception to the rule. I had to suppress every evolutionary instinct inside me and pay them no attention whatsoever. With me were Mystery and two of our students, Outbreak and the Matador of Love. The rest of our pupils were sarging on the perimeter of the dancefloor downstairs. Outbreak went in first, complimenting the platinum twins on their outfits. They brushed him off like a gnat. Next, the Matador of Love moved in with the Maury Povich opener. He too crashed and burned. Now it was my turn. This was going to take every bit of confidence and self-esteem that Steve P. and Rasputin had hypnotized into me. If I showed even a flicker of weakness or doubt, they'd eat me alive. \"That tall one isn't a 10,\" Mystery leaned in and whispered to me. \"She's an 11. This is going to take some hardcore negging.\" The girls strolled to the bar, where they began talking to a transvestite in a black tutu. I moved in, not even glancing at them, and greeted the transvestite as if l knew him. I asked if he worked at the club, and he said no. It didn't really matter what I said to him: I was just maneuvering into position, pawning him for the two-set. Now that I was in range, it was time to neg. \"That girl over there is bit\u00ad ing your style,\" I said to the 10, the shorter of the two. \"Look at her.\" I pointed to another platinum blonde in a white outfit. \"She's just got the same hair,\" the 10 replied, dismissively. Page 166 152 \"No, look at her outfit,\" I persisted. \"It's almost the exact same.\" They looked over, and here was the make-or-break moment. If I didn't come up with something good to follow, I'd lose their interest and be branded just another weirdo. So I continued with the negging. \"You know what?\" I told them. \"You both look like strange little snowflakes.\" It was a bizarre, cryptic comment, but now I had their attention. I could sense it, and my heart began to pump faster. I continued with what I knew all along would be my true opener: \"I have to ask you something. Is your hair real?\" The 10 looked shocked, then recovered her composure. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Feel it.\" I pulled it gently. \"Hey, it moved. It's not real.\" \"Pull harder.\" I complied, and yanked it so hard that her neck jerked back. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I believe you. But how about your friend there?\" The 11's face reddened. She leaned over the bar and looked me hard in the eye. \"That is really rude. What if I'm bald underneath here? That could really hurt someone's feelings. It's disrespectful. How would you feel if someone said that to you?\" The pickup is a high stakes game, and to win you have to play hard. All I had done so far was commandeer their attention and provoke an emo\u00ad tional reaction. Sure, it was a negative one, but now we had a relationship. If I could turn her anger around, I'd be in. Fortunately, I happened to be trying to make a point to the students and was wearing a black mod wig and a fake lip piercing\u2014just to show that looks don't matter. It's all game. I leaned over the bar and stared the 11 down. \"Well,\" I told her. \"I actu\u00ad ally am wearing a wig, and I am bald underneath here.\" I paused, and she looked at me with her mouth open. She didn't know how to respond. Now it was time to reel her in. \"And I'll tell you something else. Whether I go out totally bald, in this wig, or in some crazy longhaired wig, it doesn't change the way I'm treated by other people. It's all your atti\u00ad tude. Don't you agree?\" Everything I say in a pickup has an ulterior motive. I needed to let her know that unlike every other guy in the bar, I am not and will not be intim\u00ad idated by her looks. Beauty to me was now a shit test: It weeded out the los\u00ad ers who got dumbstruck by it. Page 167 153 \"I live in Los Angeles,\" I continued. \"It's where the most beautiful women in the country come to try and make it. You look around a club there, and everyone's good-looking. It makes this VIP room look like a dive bar.\" They were words",
  "71": "I'd learned, almost verbatim, from Ross Jeffries. And they were working. I let her look around, then continued: \"And do you know what I've learned? Beauty is common. It's something you're born with or you pay for. What counts is what you make of yourself. What counts is a great outlook and a great personality.\" Now I was in. It was the girls who were dumbstruck now, not me. I had entered their world, as Jeffries once put it to me, and demonstrated author\u00ad ity over it. And, to ensure my position there, I threw in one more neg, but softened with a slight compliment, as if they were winning me over: \"And you know what? You have a great smile. I can tell that underneath all that, you're probably a good person.\" The 10 sidled up to me and said, \"We're sisters.\" A lesser pickup artist would have thought that his work was done, that he had won them over. But no, this was just one more shit test. I looked very slowly at both of them, and then took a chance. \"Bullshit,\" I said, smiling. \"I bet a lot of guys believe you, but I'm a very intuitive person. When I look at you both, I can tell you're very different. Too different.\" The 10 broke into a guilty smile. \"We never tell anyone this,\" she said, \"but you're right. We're just friends.\" Now I'd broken through her programming, moved her away from the auto-pilot responses she gives to men, and demonstrated that I was not just another guy. I took another chance: \"And I'd be willing to bet that you haven't even been friends for that long. Usually, best friends start to have the same mannerisms, and you two don't really.\" \"We've only known each other a year,\" the 10 admitted. Now it was time to back off my game and fluff a little. However, I made sure never to ask questions; instead, as Juggler had taught me, I made open- ended statements that led them to ask me the questions. The 10 told me they were from San Diego, so we fluffed for a while about the West Coast and Miami. As we talked, I kept my back to the 11, as if I were less interested in her. This was classic Mystery Method: I wanted her thinking more about me, wondering why I wasn't giving her the atten\u00ad tion she was so used to. Nothing in the game is an accident. Page 168 154 I think of a woman's interest in me as a fire, and when it starts to die out, it's time to turn around and stoke it. So, just when the 11 was about to walk away to find someone to talk to, I turned around and delivered a beau\u00ad tiful line: \"You know what? When I look at you, I can see exactly what you looked like in middle school. And I'm willing to bet you weren't so outgo\u00ad ing or popular then.\" Sure, it was a truism. But she stared at me flabbergasted, wondering how I could possibly know that. To seal the victory, I laid out one last beauty-neutralizing cold-reading routine. \"I bet a lot of people think you're a bitch. But you're not. You're actually shy in a lot of ways.\" She began to give me the doggy dinner-bowl look, as the PUAs call it. It is the look that is the goal of any approach. Her eyes glazed over, her pupils dilated, and she just watched my lips move, entranced and attracted. I no\u00ad ticed, however, that the more interested the 11 became, the more kino the 10 gave me. \"You're interesting,\" the 10 gushed, pressing her breasts against me. I could see Mystery, Outbreak, and the Matador of Love rooting me on in the background. \"We have to hang out with you in L.A.\" She leaned in and gave me a tight hug. \"Hey, that'll be thirty dollars,\" I told her, disentangling myself. \"This shit ain't free.\" The more you push them away, the more they run toward you. \"I love him,\" she told her friend. Then she asked if she and her friend could stay with me next time they were in L.A. \"Sure,\" I said. But as the words left my mouth, I realized, too late, that I should have made my hospitality more of a challenge. There's so much to remember and juggle during a pickup that it is hard to get everything per\u00ad fect. But no matter. She gave me her phone number, and I gave",
  "72": "her mine. You may have noticed that I haven't been referring to these girls by their names. That's because I never introduce myself during a pickup. As Mystery had taught me at that first workshop, I wait for the woman to in\u00ad troduce herself or ask for my name. That way, I know she's interested. So, as we exchanged numbers, I received my first real IOIs and learned that the 10 was Rebekah and the 11 was Heather. Now it was time to separate the two of them and see if I could get enough IOIs to kiss-close Heather. A guy they knew suddenly showed up and bought three shots\u2014for Heather, Rebekah, and himself. I held out my empty hand and looked around, pretending to be hurt. Heather, who I was slowly realizing was ac- Page 169 155 tually a sweet girl beneath that laboriously wrought exterior, took the bait. \"Don't mind him,\" she said, pointing to their guy friend. \"He's just rude.\" As she called the bartender over and ordered me a shot, Rebekah threw her a dirty look. \"Remember our rule?\" she whined. I knew what their rule was: Girls like this love it when guys buy them drinks. But David X had taught me better: Girls don't respect guys who buy them drinks. A true pickup artist knows never to buy meals, drinks, or gifts for a girl he hasn't slept with. Dating is for tools. \"We promised not to buy any drinks on this trip,\" Rebekah whined. \"But you're not buying a drink for yourself,\" I told them. \"You're buy\u00ad ing one for me. And I'm different from all the other guys.\" I'm not really that arrogant, but in the game there are rules. And the rules must be obeyed, because they work. Suddenly, Mystery walked toward me and whispered in my ear, \"Isolate!\" \"I want to show you something,\" I said to Heather, as I took her by the hand. I led her to a nearby booth, sat her down, and performed the ESP ex\u00ad periment. Behind me, I saw Mystery punching his fist into his open hand in slow motion. It was a code: the signal to phase shift, to slow down and move in for the kill. I told her about soul-gazing and, with house music and dozens of con\u00ad versations blaring around us, we stared into each other's eyes and shared a moment together. In my head, I imagined her as the pudgy middle school student she used to be. If I'd been thinking about how beautiful she really was, I would have been too nervous to sully her with my lips, as I was about to attempt to do. I slowly moved my head toward hers. \"No lips,\" she said, quietly. I held up my index finger, placed it against her lips, and said, \"Shhhh.\" Then I kissed her\u2014on the lips. It would have been the most beautiful kiss of my life. But I was so lost in the seduction that I forgot I was wearing a fake lip ring. Worried that it would fall out (or, even worse, end up on her lip), I pulled back, looked at her again, and then nibbled on her lower lip. Her tongue darted out of her mouth. \"Hey, not so fast,\" I told her, as if she were the one hitting on me. The key to physical escalation, David DeAngelo had said in his seminar, is always two steps forward, one step back. Page 170 156 We made out carefully, and then I returned her to Rebekah at the bar. I had a workshop to wing, so I told them both that it was a pleasure meeting them and I should rejoin my friends. We confirmed our plans to spend a weekend together, and I left with my heart singing. The Matador of Love was the first person to run up to me. He took my hand in his and kissed it. \"In India, we put ourselves prostrate before people like you,\" he said, flapping his arms excitedly. \"You've given me a new mean\u00ad ing on life. It was like watching John Elway do the two-minute drive. You knew he had game before, but in that moment he really proved it. You got the Super Bowl ring.\" For the rest of the night, I was on fire. Women who hadn't even seen me with the platinum non-sisters were opening me. They could smell it. When I ran into Heather again, I asked her, \"You're not a thief, are you?\" \"No,\" she said. I removed my necklace and very slowly put it around",
  "73": "her neck. \"This is still mine,\" I whispered, kissing her lightly. \"It's something to remember to\u00ad night by. But I want it back next time I see you. It's very special to me.\" As I walked away, I knew I'd just made her night. It didn't even matter whether I got laid or not, because this was the game artfully played. It was exactly what I'd been working so hard for. I just didn't realize that I'd ever be able to pull it off so smoothly or that, in the process, I was creating a hunger that could never be satiated. Page 171 After another two months of workshops, I flew back to Los Angeles for a break. But I grew restless sitting at home alone. There were clubs and bars full of sets to be opened, each one a potential new adventure. The compul\u00ad sion to sarge consumed my body like a fever. Fortunately, I received a call from Grimble. He was at the Whiskey Bar and had started talking to Heidi Fleiss, the former Hollywood madam who'd recently been released from jail for pandering and tax evasion. She wanted to meet me. I slipped into a custom-made suit I had recently bought, threw my prop bag over my shoulder, and dabbed a different cologne on each wrist. I had a feeling this was not a casual call. When I arrived, Grimble was standing next to her at the bar. He was wearing the exact same floral-print button-down shirt I had met him in, ex\u00ad cept the silver had faded to gray from so many washings. Three buttons were open, and his hairless chest was thrust further out than ever. Like a baseball player, he seemed to believe it was his lucky shirt. \"This is Style,\" Grimble told her, flashing a shady smile that was a little unnerving to a friend, but to a certain type of girl was no doubt a turn on. \"The guy I was telling you about.\" Heidi was attractive but hard, like only women who've had to fend for themselves in Los Angeles can be. I wondered if he was trying to set me up with her. She seemed like an odd choice. I try to avoid women who've served time. She reached out and shook my hand firmly. \"So,\" she said. \"Show me your stuff.\" \"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"Grimble here says you're a pickup artist. He was telling me about what you teach. Let's see what you've got.\" I flashed Grimble a dirty look. He'd sold me out. \"Why don't you show her?\" I asked Grimble. \"I have a girl here,\" he said, flashing a cruel smile and nodding to a petite Hispanic woman in four-inch heels. \"Besides, she can see me on Elimidate.\" Page 172 158 Grimble had told me months ago that he was going to test his seduc\u00ad tion skills by auditioning for the dating show Elimidate. I just didn't realize he'd gone through with it\u2014and actually been accepted. \"When's it airing?\" I asked. \"Tomorrow night.\" \"Who won?\" \"I'm not allowed to talk about it. You'll have to watch.\" I searched his face for a clue, but he betrayed nothing. \"Well.\" Heidi prodded. \"Go pick up a girl. I bet I can get anyone you can.\" It looked like I would be competing in my own Elimidate that night. I was exhausted from months of travel and constant pickups, but I wasn't going to pass up the challenge. Heidi spun around and approached three girls who were sitting on the patio smoking. The battle had begun. I opened a nearby three-set\u2014two men and a lady who looked like an an- chorwoman in search of a camera\u2014with the cologne opener. Afterward, I asked the usual fact-finding question: \"How do you all know each other?\" Unfortunately, she was married to one of the guys in the set. Just as I was about to eject, Heidi marched in. \"So,\" she asked my former target. \"How do you know Style?\" \"We just met him,\" she said. \"You looked like old friends,\" Heidi told her with an obsequious smile. Then she turned to me and whispered, \"They're boring. Let's move on.\" As we left, I asked how her three-set had gone. \"The girls were all twenty,\" she said. \"I could have turned them out in a half hour.\" Evidently, pickup to Heidi Fleiss meant recruiting girls as escorts. Minutes later, she was in another group. I had to",
  "74": "give her credit: She had no fear of approaching. I decided it was time to humble her with the awesome power of my newfound game. She was kneeling on the ground in front of two women with gold glit\u00ad ter lightly dusting their cheeks, talking about local restaurants. I walked in with a new opinion opener I had made up about a friend whose new girl\u00ad friend won't let him talk to his ex-girlfriend from college. \"Is she being fair?\" I asked. \"Or is she being too possessive?\" The point was to get the glitter girls talking amongst themselves, but Heidi blurted, \"The guy should just fuck both girls. I mean, I always put out on the first night.\" Page 173 159 The line must have been part of her routine; it was the second time I'd heard her say it. I also noticed that she always kneeled on the ground after approaching, so as not to intimidate the girls. I was glad Grimble had called: Heidi Fleiss was one of us. In recent weeks, I'd figured out my own routine. It was a simple struc\u00ad ture that allowed me to determine the direction in which I needed to take a girl: First, open. Then demonstrate higher value. Next, build rapport and an emotional connection. And, finally, create a physical connection. So now that I'd opened the set, it was time to demonstrate value and blow Heidi out. I ran a piece I'd invented after meeting the fake sisters in Miami\u2014the best friends test. \"I have to ask you guys: How long have you known each other?\" I began. \"About six years,\" one of the girls said. \"I could totally tell.\" \"How?\" \"Rather than explain, I'll give you two the best friends test.\" The girls leaned in toward me, thrilled by the idea of an innocous test. Guys in the community have an expression for this phenomenon: I was giv\u00ad ing them \"chick crack.\" Most women, they say, respond to routines involv\u00ad ing tests, psychological games, fortune-telling, and cold-reading like addicts respond to free drugs. \"Okay,\" I said, as if I were about to ask a serious question. The girls huddled in closer. \"Do you both use the same shampoo?\" They looked at each other to decide on an answer, then turned to me and opened their mouths to speak. \"The answer doesn't matter,\" I cut them off. \"You already passed.\" \"But we don't use the same shampoo,\" one of the girls said. \"But you both looked at each other before you answered. See, if you didn't know each other well, you'd keep eye contact with me. But when two people have a connection, they look at each other first and communicate al\u00ad most telepathically before answering. They don't even need to speak to each other.\" The two girls looked at each other again. \"See,\" I exclaimed. \"You're doing it right now.\" They burst out laughing. Big points for Style. As the girls started telling me how they'd met on the plane the day they'd moved to Los Angeles and been inseparable ever since, I looked at Page 174 160 Heidi Fleiss kneeling there uselessly. The girls seemed to have completely forgotten about her. But Heidi was no quitter. \"So,\" she announced loudly, \"are any of you girls gonna fuck him?\" Ouch. In one sentence, she had humiliated me. Of course none of the girls wanted to fuck me\u2014not yet. I hadn't even made it halfway through my se\u00ad quence, and even if I had, the comment still would have blown me out. \"Hey, I'm not that easy,\" I responded, recovering a little too late. \"I need trust, comfort, and connection first.\" Heidi and I walked away together. She clapped a hand on my shoulder and smiled. \"If I left here right now,\" she said, \"they'd follow me out like a line of ducks.\" Seconds later, she was in another two-set. I dashed in after her, and the competition was on again. She was sitting with a balding man who said he was a stand-up comic and a heavily peacocked woman with long gumball- blue hair, an impish voice, and a wickedly smart sense of humor. Her name was Hillary, and she said she was performing a burlesque show the follow\u00ad ing night at a club called the Echo. She was so interesting, I hardly needed to game her. We",
  "75": "just talked, and I took her phone number right in front of her date. Then Heidi invited them to a party and gave Hillary her number. She wasn't going to let me walk away victorious. \"I could have her working in a day,\" she said. She always had to get the last word in. Some people are born to be rock singers. Others are born to be teach\u00ad ers. \"I was born to be a madam,\" Heidi said. \"I'll always be one.\" Every time she left a set, she was convinced she could have turned the girls into hookers or extracted them to her house\u2014even though those days were now behind her. By the time we left the bar that night, we had com\u00ad peted for every girl in the place. And I'd learned that there's a fine line be\u00ad tween pimp and player. Grimble and his date came up to me laughing afterward. \"That was the sickest thing I've ever seen,\" he said. \"I can't believe how much you've changed. You're like a new man.\" He gave my forehead a slimy kiss and then negged me. \"You held your ground pretty well, especially considering she had an advantage because everyone recognized her.\" \"Well,\" I replied. \"Let's see if you do any better on Elimidate tomorrow.\" Page 175 It was a red-letter day for the seduction community. Tonight on Elimidate, Grimble would be paired with three other eligible bachelors to compete for the favor of a lingerie model named Alison. Our entire lifestyle was at stake. If he won, it would prove that the community really did have a social edge over the jocks and studs we'd felt inferior to all our lives. If he lost, then we were just self-delusional keyboard jockeys. The fate of PUAs everywhere was in his hands. I sat on Grimble's couch and watched the episode with Twotimer. Where the other guys on the show tried to suck up to Allison, Grimble leaned back and acted as if he were the prize. Where the other guys bragged about how successful they were, Grimble took the advice of his new guru and claimed to be a disposable lighter repairman. He made it past the first elimination. During the second round, a waitress brought a bottle of champagne to the table for Alison, courtesy of Grimble. She was shocked, especially since Grimble hadn't been trying as hard as the other guys. He made it past the second elimination. The final round was on the dance floor, which I knew would seal it, be\u00ad cause Grimble and I had taken salsa-dancing lessons together. When he dipped her to the floor and scooped her back up, taking her breath away, I could see it in her eyes. He had won. \"Congratulations,\" I told him. \"You have vindicated the good name of PUAs around the world.\" \"Yeah,\" he said, with a cocky smile. \"Not all models are stupid.\" We went out that night to see Hillary perform. Since my crush on Jes\u00ad sica Nixon in sixth grade, one-itis had been a regular part of my life. But in the past eight months, I hadn't felt even a tremor of one-itis. In fact, every woman I met seemed disposable and replaceable. I was experiencing se\u00ad ducer's paradox: The better a seducer I became, the less I loved women. Suc\u00ad cess was no longer defined by getting laid or finding a girlfriend, but by how well I performed. The bars and clubs became, as Mystery had coached me at Page 176 162 that first workshop, just different levels on a video game I had to get through. I knew Hillary, in particular, would be a challenge. Not only was she sharp and cynical, but she'd seen me run around picking up women all night with Heidi Fleiss. Grimble and I sat in the back of the Echo and watched Hillary strip. She was dressed as a gangster, with a machine gun water pistol and a form- fitting pinstripe suit over a garter and matching panties. She had a classi\u00ad cally curvy body that suited the art form. When she saw me in the back of the room, she sashayed over, sat on my lap, and sprayed me in the face with the water pistol. I wanted her. Afterward, I joined Hillary, her sister, and two of her friends for drinks at a Mexican bar called El Carmen. As we talked, I took Hillary's hand in mine. She",
  "76": "squeezed back. IOI. Grimble was right: A new me had evolved. She took a step closer to me. My heart began to hammer against my chest, as it always does during the two parts of a pickup that give me the most anxiety: the approach and the kiss. But just as I was about to tell her about animals and evolution and hair- pulling lions, disaster struck. Andy Dick walked in the bar with a group of his friends. One of them knew Hillary, so they joined us at the table\u2014and suddenly my game evaporated. Our connection was eclipsed. There was a brighter, shinier object in her field of vision. When we rearranged ourselves, Andy Dick somehow ended up between us, separating me from Hillary. He was all over her in an instant. It happens in Los Angeles: Celebrities hit on your dates. In my AFC days, I stood by helplessly and watched one night at the Whiskey Bar as Robert Blake slipped my date his phone num\u00ad ber. But I was a PUA now, and a PUA wouldn't stand by helplessly and watch a celebrity molest his date. Why was I constantly battling tabloid stars for this girl? I stood up and walked outside. I needed to think. I'd given Heidi Fleiss a run for her money the night before, so I ought to be able to take out Andy Dick. It wasn't going to be easy, though, because he was so loud and obnox\u00ad ious. It was clear from the moment he arrived why he'd become a star: He loved attention. The only chance I had was to become more interesting than he was. Grimble was outside, talking to a woman with curly, unkempt brown hair. He reached into his pants pocket and pulled out a pen and paper. He was about to number-close. Page 177 163 Suddenly, the girl broke away from Grimble. \"Style?!\" She peered at me, incredulous. I looked at her: She seemed familiar. \"It's me,\" she said. \"Jackie.\" My jaw dropped. It was the stinky-footed comedian whose hotel room I had run out of. My first semi-success story. Either this was a miraculous co\u00ad incidence, or we were running out of fresh women to sarge. I talked to her for a while about her comedy class, then excused myself. I couldn't lose any more time; every minute was an inch higher up Hillary's thigh that Andy Dick's hand was moving. And I had a plan to stop it. I walked back to the table, sat down, and ran the best-friends test on Hillary and her sister, which diverted the attention to me. Then, after dis\u00ad cussing body language, I suggested we play the lying game. In the game, a woman comes up with four true statements and one lie about her house or her car. However, she does not say them out loud; she merely thinks them one at a time. And by looking for a variation in her eye movements, you can usually tell which is untrue because people look in different directions when they lie than when they're telling the truth. All through the game I teased Hillary mercilessly, until her body language closed off to Andy Dick and opened up to me. Andy asked me what I did for work (I didn't realize this at the time, but it was an IOI), and I told him I was a writer. He said he was thinking of writ\u00ad ing his own book. Soon he completely forgot about Hillary and started bar- raging me with questions, asking if I'd help him. He was my fan. And, as Mystery says, own the men and you own the women. \"My biggest fear is being thought of as boring,\" he told me. That was his weakness. I had beat him by being more interesting than him\u2014and by having value to him. The tactics had worked, even better than they had the night before with Heidi Fleiss. Only I didn't realize just how well they had worked. Andy slid closer to me and whispered: \"What are you? Straight, bi, or gay?\" \"Urn, straight.\" \"I'm bi,\" he said, breathing in my ear. \"That's too bad. We could've had a lot of fun.\" After Andy and his friends left, I cozied back up to Hillary. She in\u00ad stantly gave me the doggy dinner bowl look. I took her hand under the table and felt the warmth emanating from her palm, from her thigh, from her breath. She would be mine tonight. I had won her. Page 178",
  "77": "When I came home from Hillary's in the morning, Dustin was waiting in my apartment for me. The king of the naturals had returned. But what was he doing in my apartment? \"Hi,\" he said in his soft, effeminate voice. He was wearing a tweed sportcoat with large brown buttons, straight-legged polyester black slacks, and a black skullcap. I hadn't talked to Dustin in more than a year, since before I had joined the community. Last I'd heard, he was managing a nightclub in Russia. He had sent me photos of his girlfriends: one for each night of the week. He ac\u00ad tually referred to them as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on. \"How'd you get in here?\" \"Your landlady, Louise, let me in. She's really a sweet person. Her son's a writer too, you know.\" He had a way of making people feel comfortable with him. \"It's good to see you, by the way,\" he said as he gave me a big bear hug. When he pulled away his eyes were misty, as if it really were good to see me again. The feeling was mutual. Dustin had been on my mind every day as I learned the pickup arts. Where Ross Jeffries needed spoken hypnotic pat\u00ad terns to convince a woman to explore her fantasies with him, Dustin was able to achieve the same result without uttering a word. He was a blank male canvas for a woman to project her repressed desires onto\u2014even if she didn't consciously know what they were before meeting him. I never had the resources to understand how he operated before; but now, with my new knowledge, I could watch him work, ask questions, and eventually model his process. I could usher a whole new school of thought into the pickup community. \"I don't know if I told you what I've been doing the past year,\" I said. \"But I've been hanging out with the world's greatest pickup artists. My whole life has changed. I get it now.\" \"I know,\" he said. \"Marko told me.\" Page 179 165 He looked at me with big, wet brown eyes, the ones that had gazed into the souls of countless beautiful women. \"I don't...\" He paused. \"I don't re\u00ad ally do that anymore.\" I looked at him\u2014incredulously, at first. But then I noticed that the skullcap on his head was a yarmulke. \"I live in Jerusalem now,\" he continued. \"In a yeshiva. It's a religious school.\" \"You're kidding.\" \"No. I haven't had sex for eight months. It's not allowed.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing: The king of the naturals had gone celibate. It couldn't be true. Wasn't that why prisons were invented? They offered men food, clothing, shelter, television, and fresh air but deprived them of the two things that really mattered\u2014freedom and women. \"Are you allowed to masturbate, at least?\" \"No.\" \"Really?\" He paused. \"Well, sometimes when I sleep, I have wet dreams.\" \"See. God is trying to tell you something. It has to come out.\" He laughed and patted me on the back. His gestures were slow and his laugh condescending, as if he had spiritually bypassed toilet humor. \"I go by my Hebrew name now,\" he said. \"It was given to me by one of the highest rabbis at the Yeshiva. It's Avisha.\" I was stunned: How could Dustin transform so suddenly from night\u00ad club player to rabbinical student\u2014especially now that I needed him most? \"So what made you give up women?\" I asked. \"When you can get any girl you want, every guy\u2014even if he's rich or famous\u2014looks at you in a different way because you have something he doesn't,\" he said. \"But after a while, I'd bring girls home, and I didn't want to have sex with them anymore. I just wanted to talk. So we'd talk all night and bond on a very deep level, and then I'd walk them to the subway in the morning. That's when I started to leave it behind. I realized that I got my entire validation from women. Women became like gods to me, but false gods. So I went to find the real God.\" Sitting in his Moscow apartment, he said, he searched the Internet for guidance, until he came across the Torah and started reading. After an eye- opening trip to Jerusalem, he returned to Russia and went to a casino party, where the mafia,",
  "78": "corrupt businessmen, and materialistic hangers-on sick- Page 180 166 ened him in comparison with the people he'd met in Israel. So he packed his bags, left his week's worth of girlfriends, and arrived in Jerusalem on the eve of Passover. \"I stopped by,\" he said, \"to ask your forgiveness for some of my past actions.\" I had no idea what he was talking about. He'd always been a great friend. \"I idealized a lifestyle and behavior that were corrupt,\" he explained. \"I abhorred kindness, mercy, human dignity, and intimacy. Instead, I used, de\u00ad graded, and exploited women. I thought only about my pleasure. I despised the good instincts within me and within others, and attempted to corrupt anyone I met.\" As he spoke, I couldn't help thinking that all these things he was apol\u00ad ogizing for were the very reasons I had befriended him in the first place. \"I promoted and dragged you into this whole pickup thing, as if what I was doing were the highest ideal a person could live for,\" he went on. \" So, to whatever extent I am guilty of affecting the natural goodness of your soul, I am deeply sorry.\" It all made sense intellectually. But I've never trusted extremes, whether it be drug addiction, religious fanaticism, or zero-carb diets. There was something odd about Dustin, or Avisha. He had a hole he was trying to fill\u2014first with women, now with religion. I listened to him, but I had a dif\u00ad ferent opinion. \"I accept your apology,\" I told him, \"but with the caveat that you have nothing to apologize for.\" He looked at me softly but didn't say anything. I could see why he was so seductive: It was those eyes that glistened like the surface of a mountain lake, that intense power of focus, that way of making you believe that noth\u00ad ing else existed for him except what you were saying at that very moment. \"Think about it,\" I continued. \"If a guy wants to improve his odds of meeting women, he's going to have to make some changes to himself. And it just so happens that all the qualities women look for in guys are good things. I mean, I've become more confident. I started working out and eat\u00ad ing healthier. I'm getting in touch with my emotions and learning more about spirituality. I've become a more fun, positive person.\" He looked at me, listening patiently. \"And I'm not just more successful with women now, I'm more success- Page 181 167 ful in every other human interaction, from dealing with my landlord to handling credit card overcharges.\" Still looking. \"So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm learning how to pick up women, sure, but in the process, I'm becoming a better human being.\" His mouth began to move. He was going to speak. \"Well,\" he said. Yes? What? \"I am eternally here for you as a true friend, and also to make up for what I did.\" He wasn't convinced. Fuck him. I was going to take a nap. \"Mind if I stay over for a couple of days?\" he asked. \"No problem, but I'm leaving for Australia on Wednesday.\" \"Do you have an alarm clock I can borrow? I need to pray with the sunrise.\" After I found him a small travel clock, he reached into his bag and pulled out a book. \"Here,\" he said. \"I brought this for you.\" It was a small hardcover edition of an eighteenth century book called The Path of the Just with a note he had written for me inscribed on the title page. It quoted the Talmud: Whoever destroys a single life is as guilty as though he had destroyed the en\u00ad tire world; and whoever rescues a single life earns as much merit as though he had rescued the entire world. So he was trying to save me. Why? I was having fun. Page 182 Mystery and I were on another road trip. The sun was blazing, the map was accurate, and there was a surfboard strapped to the top of a brand-new rental car. We had five workshops sold out in three cities in Australia. Life was good, at least for me. Mystery, however, was in low spirits. I made a mental note to never go on a road trip with him again. Before he left Toronto, his girlfriend, Patri\u00ad cia, had given him an",
  "79": "ultimatum: marriage and children, or good-bye. \"I haven't been laid in five days because of this bullshit,\" Mystery said as we drove up the coast of Queensland. \"But I've been jerking it mercilessly to lesbian porn. I guess I've been sort of depressed a bit.\" After four years of dating, their goals were diverging. Mystery wanted to travel the world as an illusionist with two loving bisexual girlfriends; Pa\u00ad tricia wanted to settle down in Toronto with one man and no bonus woman. Celebrity and alternative lifestyle be damned. \"I do not understand women,\" he complained. \"I mean, I know exactly what to do to attract them. But I still don't understand them.\" We'd come to Australia because Sweater, the older Australian student from Mystery's first workshop, had invited us to stay with him for a week in Brisbane. After four months of sarging, he had finally met the woman he wanted to marry. \"I'm like a smitten teenager,\" Sweater exclaimed when we pulled into his driveway. He looked nothing like the insecure middle-aged man I had met in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. He was tan, healthy, and, most ex\u00ad traordinarily, an irresistibly welcoming smile was now plastered constantly to his face. Helena Rubinstein once said, \"There are no ugly women; only lazy ones.\" Since society holds men to less rigid standards of beauty than women, this is doubly true of guys. Give a man like Sweater\u2014or any man\u2014a tan, better posture, whiter teeth, a fitness regime, and clothes that fit, and he's well on his way to handsome. \"I just spent the week in Sydney with my girlfriend,\" Sweater said, walk- Page 183 169 ing us into his house. \"We talk on the phone about seven times a day. I asked her to marry me before I left. It's sick, isn't it? And on top of that, I made half a million dollars this week on a real-estate seminar. So life is just amazing. Thanks to the community, I have health, fun, money, love, and great people all around me.\" Sweater's place was a sunny, airy bachelor pad overlooking Brisbane River and the City Botanic Gardens. He had a large pool and Jacuzzi; there were three bedrooms upstairs; on the ground floor, four employees\u2014all en\u00ad terprising, fresh-faced Australian boys in their early twenties\u2014sat at a large horseshoe-shaped desk, each working on his own computer. Sweater had not only trained each of them to sell his products\u2014books and courses on real-estate investing\u2014but he'd turned them onto the seduction commu\u00ad nity as well. By day, they made Sweater money; by night, they went sarging with him. \"I'm still having fun helping the guys here get girls, but I'm off the market,\" Sweater said when we asked how he felt about his decision to set\u00ad tle down with one woman. \"And as far as I'm concerned, I'm getting out at the top. I've come to understand that without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it's a relationship, a business, or a hobby.\" In many ways, I was jealous. I hadn't met any woman yet I could say that about. Mystery's workshop had changed all of our lives. Sweater was filthy rich and in love; Extramask had recently moved out of his parents' house and finally orgasmed in coitus; and I was traveling the world teaching men a skill I'd never even possessed a year ago. Mystery was even more blown away than I was by Sweater\u2014less by his engagement than by his home office. When he wasn't grilling Sweater and his employees on how they ran their business, he was silently watching them work. \"I want this,\" he kept telling Sweater. \"You have a good social environ\u00ad ment, and it creates a good working environment. I'm rotting away in Toronto.\" As we drove to the airport, tan and flush with excitement, Mystery and I plotted our next adventure. \"I have a one-on-one workshop booked in Toronto next month,\" Mys\u00ad tery said. \"The guy is paying me fifteen hundred dollars.\" Page 184 170 \"How'd he get the money?\" Most of Mystery's clients were college kids who could barely scrape together the standard fee, which he'd raised to",
  "80": "six hundred dollars while reducing the number of nights from four to three. \"His dad's rich,\" Mystery said. \"Exoticoption, from the Belgrade work\u00ad shop, told him about me. He's a student at the University of Wisconsin. He just started posting online under the name Papa.\" Most conversations with Mystery involved plans: organizing work\u00ad shops, performing a ninety-minute magic show, creating a porn website in which we'd have sex with girls disguised as clowns. His latest scheme was the PUA tattoo. \"Everyone in the Lounge is going to get the tattoo,\" he said as we parted ways at the airport. \"It'll be a heart on the right wrist, directly over the pulse. It'll allow us to identify each other in the field. And it'll be great for an illu\u00ad sion; I can teach you how to stop your pulse for ten seconds.\" A couple of PUAs had already run out and gotten the tattoo\u2014including Vision, which was somewhat of a surprise considering he'd moved to Los Angeles to make it as an actor. He'd e-mailed us a photo. But there was a problem: He'd put the tattoo in the wrong place and upside down. The heart was supposed to go over the vein where the pulse can be felt. But he had put it in the center of his wrist, an inch too high, and facing inward. Nonetheless, it was a vote of affirmation, a pact that this PUA society was for life. Page 185 The day had arrived. This would be the most monumental trip of my se\u00ad duction career. First, I was going to Toronto for Papa's one-on-one work\u00ad shop with Mystery. Then we were going to get our PUA heart tattoos, take the bus to New York for Mystery's first classroom seminar, and finally, fly to Bucharest so Mystery could implement what he called Project Bliss. He wanted to return to Eastern Europe, find two young bisexual women searching for a better life overseas, and seduce them. He planned to get them student visas, take them back to Canada, and train them to become strippers, girlfriends, and, eventually, magic assistants. Tattoos and white slavery: That's where self-improvement had led me. On my way out of the house, I checked my mailbox. Along with the usual overdue bills and raised car insurance notices was a postcard of the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. \"Your Hebrew name is Tuvia.\" The writing was Dustin's. \"It comes from the word Tov, or good. Its opposite is Ra, or evil. And in Hebrew, Tov also means that which endures and Ra is that which is short-lived. So your essence is connected to a desire to search out and connect to that which endures\u2014the good. But sometimes you get stuck at the bad along the way.\" On the flight, I reread the postcard. Dustin was trying to give me a mes\u00ad sage from God. And maybe he had a point. But, on the other hand, I'd had an enduring wish ever since adolescence for the power to seduce any woman I wanted. Now I was getting my wish. This was good. This was Tov. Mystery had recently gotten his own place in Toronto with a PUA named No. 9, a Chinese software engineer who, thanks to Mystery's ever- present advice, had turned himself into a relatively cool-looking guy. They lived in a cramped two-bedroom apartment above a cybercaf\u00e9 near the Uni\u00ad versity of Toronto. Since No. 9 was out of town, I put my bags in his room and joined Mys\u00ad tery in the kitchen. Patricia had broken up with him, for good this time. And he'd been staying in his room a lot, playing a video game called Mor\u00ad rowind and downloading lesbian porn. Getting out of the house for these upcoming workshops would be good therapy for him. Page 186 172 There were three types of people who signed up for the workshops. There were guys like Exoticoption from Belgrade, who were normal and well-adjusted socially, but wanted to have greater flexibility and choice in meeting girls. There were guys who were uptight and set in their ways, like Cliff, who couldn't even handle having a nickname like everybody else. They tended to gather as much knowledge as they could but had trouble making even the smallest behavioral change. And then",
  "81": "there were people like Papa\u2014approach machines who compensated for a lack of social skills with a lack of social fears. Approach machines tended to improve the fastest, simply by following the flowchart of material they were given. But once they ran out of material, they floundered. And this was going to be Papa's challenge. He was a soft-spoken Chi\u00ad nese pre-law student. He wore a checkered button-down shirt and jeans that were a size too large. They always seemed to arrive in a checkered button-down shirt and oversized jeans. And they always left in a loud shiny shirt, tight black synthetic pants, silver rings, and sunglasses pushed up on their heads. It was the player uniform, designed to convey sexuality, which was evidently synonymous with cheesiness. Mystery and I sat down with Papa at a cafe and asked the usual ques\u00ad tions: What's your score? What would you like it to be? What are your stick\u00ad ing points? \"Well, I used to be the social chair of my fraternity,\" he began. \"And I come from a lot of money. My father is the president of a major university.\" \"Let me cut you off right there,\" I said. \"You're qualifying yourself to us. Instead of gaining our admiration, all you're doing is displaying lower status. A rich man doesn't have to tell you he's rich.\" Papa nodded stupidly. His head seemed to be surrounded by a dense invisible fog, which made his reaction time just a little slower than most people's. It gave the impression that he wasn't all there. \"Is it okay if I record everything you're saying?\" Papa asked, struggling to pull a small digital recorder out of his pocket. There are certain bad habits we've groomed our whole life\u2014from per\u00ad sonality flaws to fashion faux pas. And it has been the role of parents and friends, outside of some minor tweaking, to reinforce the belief that we're okay just as we are. But it's not enough to just be yourself. You have to be your best self. And that's a tall order if you haven't found your best self yet. That's why the workshops were so life-transforming: We told each stu- Page 187 173 dent the first impression he made. We weren't afraid of hurting his feelings. We corrected his every gesture, phrase, and item of clothing, because we knew he wasn't living up to his potential. None of us is. We get stuck in old thought and behavior patterns that may have been effective when we were twelve months or twelve years old, but now only serve to hold us back. And, while those around us may have no problem correcting our minor flaws, they let the big ones slide, because it would mean attacking who we are. But who are we, really? Just a bundle of good genes and bad genes mixed with good habits and bad habits. And since there's no gene for cool\u00ad ness or confidence, then being uncool and unconfident are just bad habits, which can be changed with enough guidance and will power. And that was Papa's asset: will power. He was an only child and used to taking any measure necessary to get what he wanted. I demonstrated some of my best routines on him\u2014the jealous girlfriend opener, the best friends test, the cube, and a new piece I'd made up involving C-shaped smiles, U-shaped smiles and the personality characteristics each conveyed. Papa recorded every word on his digital recorder. He would later transcribe them, memorize them, and ultimately use my exact words to pick up Paris Hilton. I should have recognized the signals then. I should have realized what was going on. This wasn't teaching; it was cloning. Mystery and I were trav\u00ad eling around the world making miniature versions of ourselves. And we would soon pay for it. Our first stop was a lounge on Queen Street. After watching Papa crash and burn in a couple of sets, I started interacting. For some reason, I was on fire. It was just one of those nights. Every woman's eye was on me. A red\u00ad head who was there with her fiance even slipped her number into my pocket. I figured this must be what they call seducer's aura: I was emanating something",
  "82": "special. And what a perfect evening to do it, too\u2014in front of a student. I noticed Papa talking to a cute girl with short brown hair and a round face that perfectly matched his. However, she wasn't paying attention to him; her eyes kept twinkling in my direction. This was what the PUAs, in their worst acronym ever, call pAImAI, which basically translates as an un\u00ad spoken invitation to approach. (Literally, it's a pre-approach invitation, male approach invitation.) When Papa walked away, I said something to her. Afterward, I couldn't remember exactly what I said\u2014and that was a good sign, because it meant I Page 188 was internalizing the game, that I was getting away from canned material, that I could ride a little without the training wheels. After two minutes, I noticed she was giving me the doggy dinner bowl look. So I popped the question: \"Would you like to kiss me?\" \"Well, I wasn't thinking about it before,\" she said, holding eye contact. I took that as a yes and moved in for the kiss. She responded enthusias\u00ad tically, thrusting her tongue into my mouth and grabbing my knee with her hand. I saw a flash in the background; Papa was taking a picture. When I came up for air, she smiled and said, \"I don't have any of your albums, but my friends like your music.\" My response: \"Umm, okay.\" Who did she think I was? Then she smiled and licked my face, like a dog. Maybe David DeAngelo was right with his whole canine-training advice. She looked at me expectantly, like I was supposed to talk about my mu\u00ad sic. I didn't want to correct her and rob her of the story she thought she'd earned by kissing me, so I politely excused myself. She gave me her phone number and told me to call when I got back to my hotel room. On the way out, the hostess of the lounge pulled me aside and said, \"Thank you very much for coming. Here's my card. Let me know if we can ever do anything for you.\" \"Who does everyone think I am?\" I asked. \"Aren't you Moby?\" So I wasn't having an on night after all. Apparently, because of my shaven head, the hostess had thought I was Moby, and she'd told half the people in the room. All that time I'd put into seduction could be subverted simply with fame. To truly get to the next level, I'd have to find a way to flip the same attraction switches a celebrity does\u2014chiefly validation and brag\u00ad ging rights\u2014without being famous. I suppose a lesser man would have taken advantage of the situation and continued the charade. But I never called the girl. I got into the game not to deceive women, but to make them like me for me\u2014or at least for the new me. In the clubs that followed, we watched Papa work. Every piece of mate\u00ad rial we gave him, he used. Every error we pointed out, he corrected instantly. With each successful set, he seemed to grow an inch taller. Instead of sum\u00ad mer school, he told me, he'd spent three months working on Speed Seduc- Page 189 tion skills. He was even studying to get a hypnotist's certification with one of the field's most respected teachers, Cal Banyan. But until this workshop, he'd never seen real PUAs in the field before. He was so blown away he signed up for another workshop on the spot. On our last day with Papa, we went to a club called Guvernment. I pushed him into sets and watched him repeat, like a robot, the openers, routines, and negs Mystery and I had taught him. And women were re\u00ad sponding to him now. It was amazing how effective just a few simple lines could be\u2014and it was also a little depressing. The first thing aspiring stand- up comics do is develop a tight five-minute routine that can win over any audience. But after seeing hundreds of rooms fill with laughter on cue at the exact same points, they begin to lose respect for their audience for being so easily manipulated. Being a successful pickup artist meant risking the same side effect. When Papa left to get some sleep before his flight home, Mystery and I stayed at the club to continue sarging. Grimble had recently given me the idea of",
  "83": "taking all the scraps of paper with phone numbers I'd collected and putting them under glass on a coffee table for decoration. But as I was sharing the idea with Mystery, he cut me off. \"Proximity alert system!\" he announced. When women stand near a man but facing away from him, especially when there's no real reason for them to be hanging out in that particular spot, it trips what Mystery calls the proximity alert system. It means they're interested; they want to be opened. Mystery wheeled around and started talking to a delicate blonde in a strapless dress and a muscular brunette in a do-rag. When he introduced me, he told them I was an amazing illusionist. We'd been winging together for months now, so I knew just what to do: fake them out with a couple of the practical jokes and pseudomagic tricks I'd learned in elementary school. In the field, one quickly learns that everything that was funny at age ten is funny all over again. Mystery had brought along a video camera, so he began taping the in\u00ad teraction. The girls didn't seem to mind. As he isolated the brunette, I talked to the blonde. Her name was Caroline; her friend was Carly. Caroline lived in the suburbs with her family. Her goal in life was to be a nurse, but she was currently working at Hooters, despite having breasts the size of SweeTarts and a shy, withdrawn personality.

Being a successful pickup artist meant risking the same side effect. When Papa left to get some sleep before his flight home, Mystery and I stayed at the club to continue sarging. Grimble had recently given me the idea of taking all the scraps of paper with phone numbers I'd collected and putting them under glass on a coffee table for decoration. But as I was sharing the idea with Mystery, he cut me off. \"Proximity alert system!\" he announced. When women stand near a man but facing away from him, especially when there's no real reason for them to be hanging out in that particular spot, it trips what Mystery calls the proximity alert system. It means they're interested; they want to be opened. Mystery wheeled around and started talking to a delicate blonde in a strapless dress and a muscular brunette in a do-rag. When he introduced me, he told them I was an amazing illusionist. We'd been winging together for months now, so I knew just what to do: fake them out with a couple of the practical jokes and pseudomagic tricks I'd learned in elementary school. In the field, one quickly learns that everything that was funny at age ten is funny all over again. Mystery had brought along a video camera, so he began taping the in\u00ad teraction. The girls didn't seem to mind. As he isolated the brunette, I talked to the blonde. Her name was Caroline; her friend was Carly. Caroline lived in the suburbs with her family. Her goal in life was to be a nurse, but she was currently working at Hooters, despite having breasts the size of SweeTarts and a shy, withdrawn personality. Page 192 176 From two feet away, Caroline's face seemed alabaster; from one foot away, I noticed it was dappled with pinprick freckles. One of her teeth was crooked. She had a red mark on the skin over her collarbone, as if she'd been itching it. She smelled like cotton. She had gotten a manicure in the last twenty-four hours. She weighed no more than one hundred pounds. Her favorite color was probably pink. I observed all these things as my mouth moved, reciting the routines I'd told to hundreds of girls before. What was different about Caroline was that the routines didn't seem to be working. I just couldn't reach what I call the hook point, which is when a woman you've approached decides she en\u00ad joys your company and doesn't want you to leave. Though I stood just a foot away from Caroline, a mile-wide chasm separated us. After watching the movie Boiler Room, about ruthless cold-calling stockbrokers, Mystery had decided that phone numbers were wood\u2014in other words, they were a waste of paper. Our new strategy was no longer to try to call a girl for a date, but to take her on a date right away\u2014an instant date\u2014to a nearby bar or restaurant. Changing venues quickly became a key piece in the pickup game. It created a sense of distorted time: If you went to three different places with a group you'd just met, by the end of the night it felt as if you'd known each other forever. \"Why don't we all grab a bite to eat?\" Mystery suggested. We walked to a diner nearby, arm-in-arm with our instant dates. Dur\u00ad ing the meal, everything suddenly clicked in the group. Carly felt comfort\u00ad able enough to unleash her biting wit, and Caroline began to radiate empathy and warmth. We didn't need any routines or tactics. We all just made fun of ourselves and each other. Juggler was right: Laughter was the best seduction. Afterward, Carly invited us to call a cab from her",
  "85": "apartment around the corner. She had just moved in and the rooms were bare of furniture, so Mys\u00ad tery and I sat on the floor. We didn't call a cab\u2014and the girls didn't remind us to, which we took as an IOI. Carly soon left the room with Mystery, giving Caroline tacit permission to fool around with me. As we wrapped ourselves around each other, the chasm that had separated us in the bar disappeared. Caroline's touch was soft and gentle, her body frail and forgiving. Now I understood why it had been so difficult to get rapport with her when we'd first met. She didn't communicate with words; she communicated with feelings. She'd make a great nurse. Page 193 177 After Caroline brought in some blankets to make the hardwood floor a little more comfortable, I went down on her. I stacked her orgasms as Steve P. had taught me, until it seemed like her body was melting into the ground. But when I reached for a condom afterward, I heard the five words that had taken the place of \"let's just be friends\" in my life: \"But I just met you.\" It was a much sweeter sound, and there was no reason to push for sex with Caroline. I knew I'd see her again. She lay on my shoulder, and we enjoyed the afterglow. She was nine\u00ad teen, she said, and hadn't had sex in almost two years. The reason: She had a one-year-old child at home in the suburbs. His name was Carter, and she was determined not to be another neglectful teenage mother. This was the first time she'd been apart from him for a weekend. When we awoke the next afternoon, awkward from the passion of the night before, Caroline suggested having breakfast at a restaurant next door. In the days that followed, I must have watched Mystery's video of that breakfast a hundred times. At the diner the night before, Caroline's blue eyes were flat and distant. But at breakfast in the morning, they glittered and danced when she looked at me. Whenever I made a joke, even one that wasn't funny, a broad smile spread across her face. Something inside her heart had opened. It was, I realized, the first time I'd made a real emotional connection with a woman since I'd started picking them up. I don't have a particular type of girl I'm attracted to, the way some guys are Asian fetishists or chubby chasers. But of all the women in the world, the last type I ever thought I'd fall for would be a nineteen-year-old single mom who waited tables at Hooters. But the great thing about the heart is that it has no master, despite what reason may think. After the girls dropped us off at home, Mystery and I broke down the events of the previous night, trying to figure out what we did right and wrong. Despite what Caroline and I had thought, Mystery hadn't even got\u00ad ten a kiss from Carly, though not for lack of trying. She had a boyfriend. She was clearly attracted to Mystery, however, despite having resisted his advances. So we concocted a plan: the freeze-out. It was based on my Moby experience. If women have sex for validation, Mystery figured, why not take validation away from her? His plan was to be cold and ignore her, until she became so uncomfortable that she wanted to cozy up to him just to make things normal again. We loaded the footage of Carly and Caroline into Mystery's computer and proceeded to spend the next six hours self-indulgently editing it into a Page 194 178 six-minute video. When we finished, I called Caroline and she picked us up that evening. Juggler was in town, running his own workshop. He'd met a preternat- urally bright jazz violinist named Ingrid and had started dating her exclu\u00ad sively. So we all went to dinner together. \"I'm going to get out of the seduction business,\" Juggler said. \"I want to devote the time to my relationship.\" Ingrid squeezed his hand approvingly. \"Some people may say I'm pussy-whipped, but I say it is my choice. These workshops are too stressful for Ingrid.\" It was good to see Juggler again. He was one of the few pickup artists who wasn't needy, who didn't scare away my",
  "86": "real-life friends, who made me laugh, who was normal. And for that very reason I didn't believe he was truly a pickup artist: He was simply a funny, masterful conversationalist. He seemed especially witty in comparison to Mystery, who was freezing us all out and making dinner somewhat uncomfortable. If Mystery's plan worked, it would be worth it; if not, then he was just an asshole. Afterward, Mystery said decisively, \"We're heading back to my place, and I'm going to show you the video I made of last night.\" Victory belongs to the person with the strongest reality and the most decisive actions. As we watched the video at Mystery's house, Caroline couldn't stop smiling. Afterward, I brought her into No. 9's room, and we lay on the bed and slowly undressed each other. Her body trembled with so much emotion that it seemed to dissipate beneath me. It felt like making love to a cloud. When she came, she didn't make a sound. As we lay together afterward, Caroline rolled away from me. She stared at the wall and grew distant. I knew what she was thinking. When I asked her about it, she burst into tears. \"I gave it up too fast,\" she sobbed. \"Now I'm never going to see you again.\" They were such sweet words, because they were so honest. I slid my arm under her and placed her head on my shoulder. I told her first of all that every passionate relationship I've ever had began passionately. It was a line I'd learned from Mystery, but I did believe it. Second, I told her that maybe she shouldn't have, but she wanted to and needed to. It was a line I'd learned from Ross Jeffries, but I did believe it. Third, I told her that I was more ma\u00ad ture than a lot of the people she'd been with before, so not to judge me by her past experiences. It was a line I'd learned from David X, but I did believe it. Finally, I told her that I'd be sad if I never saw her again. It wasn't a line. Page 195 179 When we finally emerged into the front room, we found Carly and Mys\u00ad tery wrapped around each other in a blanket. Judging by the clothing strewn across the floor, Mystery's freeze-out had been a success. Caroline and I spooned on the couch next to them, and together we watched an episode of The Osbournes on Mystery's computer, each basking in our own post-coital glow. It was a beautiful moment. And it wouldn't last. Page 196 There is nothing more bonding than successfully picking up girls together. It is the basis for a great friendship. Because afterward, when the girls are gone, you can finally give each other the high-five that you've been holding back since you met them. It is the sweetest high-five in the world. It's not just the sound of skin hitting skin; it's the sound of brotherhood. \"You know what's so fucked up?\" Mystery said. \"I feel so bad, and then a girl sleeps with me and likes me and, bam, I'm on top of the world again.\" Smack. \"So?\" Mystery asked. \"So.\" \"Are you ready to commit to this lifestyle?\" \"I thought I was committed.\" \"No, for life. It's in your blood now. You and me, we have to challenge each other. Of all the guys I've met, you're my only competition. No one else has the chance to reach the throne except you.\" When I was a teenager, I'd lie awake in bed, praying to God, \"Please don't let me die before having sex. I just want to see what it feels like.\" But now I have a different dream. At night, I lay in bed and ask God to just let me have the opportunity to be a father before I die. I've always lived for ex\u00ad perience: traveling, learning new skills, meeting new people. But having a child is the ultimate experience: It's what we're here for. And despite my rakish behavior, I hadn't lost sight of that. Yet, at the same time, living for experiences also means wanting the novelty and adventure of dating different women. I can't imagine ever choosing one person for life. It's not that I'm scared of commitment; it's that I'm scared of arguing with someone I love over whose turn it is to do the dishes, of losing the desire to have sex",
  "87": "with the woman lying next to me every night, of taking a back seat in her heart to our children, of resenting someone for limiting my freedom to be selfish. This pickup thing had never been about sowing my wild oats. My oats are always going to be wild. And that's not necessarily something I relish. I'm Page 197 181 screwing up my chances of being a cool dad. If I'd married my first girlfriend and had kids with her, they'd be, say, eight and ten now. And I'd be an excel\u00ad lent father, able to relate to them on nearly every level. But it's too late for me now. By the time my kids are ten, I'll be well into my forties. I'll be so out of touch they'll make fun of my taste in music and beat me at arm-wrestling. And now I was really going to screw up my chances of getting married: I was about to brand myself a player for life. An hour later, Mystery and I were outside Fineline Tattoo on Kingston Road. I was smarter than this, I thought. But it's easy to get caught up in the moment, in the hand slap, in the brotherhood. I turned the handle of the door and pushed. It didn't open. Though it was three o'clock on a Monday afternoon, the shop was closed. \"Damn,\" Mystery said. \"Let's find somewhere else.\" I'm not a superstitious person, but when I'm on the fence about an idea, it only takes a slight draft to push me in either direction. \"I can't go through with this,\" I said. \"What's wrong?\" \"I have problems with commitment. I don't think I can even commit to a tattoo that signifies a lack of commitment.\" My neurotic nature had saved me for once. The next night, Caroline drove to Mystery's house, and we all went out for sushi. \"Where's Carly?\" Mystery asked. Caroline flushed and looked into her tea. \"She, um, couldn't make it,\" she said. \"She says hi, though.\" I could see Mystery's body language change. He slumped in his chair and pressed further. \"Did she say why? Is there a problem?\" \"Well,\" Caroline said. \"She's ... well, she's with her boyfriend.\" Mystery's face went pale. \"And she wouldn't come?\" \"Carly said you and she were very different anyway.\" Mystery went quiet. He didn't speak for another ten minutes. When\u00ad ever we asked a question to draw him out, he responded monosyllabically. It wasn't that he loved Carly; he just hated rejection. He was experiencing the downside of seducing a woman with a boyfriend: She usually went back to him afterward. And seeing Caroline and I enjoying each other's company so much only rubbed it in. Page 198 182 \"I'm the world's greatest pickup artist,\" he grumbled in my direction. \"How come I don't have a girlfriend?\" \"Well, maybe because you're the world's greatest pickup artist.\" After a long period of silence, Mystery asked Caroline to drive him to the strip club where his ex-girlfriend Patricia worked. She dropped him off in the parking lot, and then took me to spend the night at the house in the suburbs where she lived with her mother, sister, and brother. It would be my first time meeting her family. Her mother greeted us at the door. In her arms was a crying baby\u2014my teenage girlfriend's baby. \"Do you want to hold him?\" Caroline asked. I suppose the stereotypical reaction would be to say that I was scared, that reality sunk in, that I wanted to get out of there. But I didn't. I wanted to hold him. It was kind of cool. This was what I got into the game for\u2014to have these kinds of adventures, to hold a baby in my arms for the first time and wonder, \"What does his mother expect of me?\" Page 199 While I was playing daddy with Caroline, Mystery was spiraling. Dropping him off at the club was a bad move. Seeing Patricia had fucked him up. Not only would she not take him back, but she also told him that she'd started dating other people. \"She's been working out three hours a day,\" he said over the phone. \"She lost fifteen pounds and her ass is a 10, dude. The things a chick will do when she's angry. Damn.\" \"Don't think about how good she looks,\" I advised. \"Look for the flaws and blow those up in your",
  "88": "mind. It'll make it easier.\" \"I know that intellectually, but emotionally I'm fucked up. I feel like I'm being raked over coals. It all came crashing down on me when I saw her again. That hot body, the tan lines. She was the hottest stripper in the place. And I can't have her. Carry's back with her boyfriend. And I'm beat from try\u00ad ing to make my new place livable. For what?\" \"Dude, you're a pickup artist. There are hundreds more just like Patri\u00ad cia out there. And you can get them in a night.\" \"I'm not a pickup artist. I'm a lover. I love women. I swear, I don't even think about threesomes anymore. I would be so happy to settle for Patricia now. I've got Patricia withdrawal on the mind. I miss her every minute of the day.\" Mystery had hardly thought about Patricia or talked about her until she rejected him. Now he was obsessed. His own theories on attraction had come back to slap him in the face. Patricia was doing a takeaway. But for her it wasn't a technique\u2014it was for real. As a magician used to exploiting the gullibility of others, Mystery had no patience with anything spiritual or supernatural. His religion was Dar\u00ad win. Love, to him, was simply an evolutionary impulse that enabled human beings to fulfill their two primary objectives: to survive and replicate. He called that impulse pairbonding. \"It's strange how strong pairbonding is,\" he said. \"I feel so alone now.\" \"I'll tell you what. We'll pick you up tomorrow, and you can play in the suburbs with us. It'll cheer you up.\" Page 200 184 Caroline and I put Carter in his stroller and pushed him around the block to a park. As I sat down on the bench, I thought about what a pa\u00ad thetic couple of pickup artists Mystery and I were. Kids around the world thought we were in hot tubs surrounded by bikini-clad models. Instead he was alone in his apartment, probably crying and watching lesbian porn, and I was in the suburbs pushing a baby around in a stroller. In the morning, Caroline and I fetched Mystery from the city. He hadn't shaved since I'd last seen him, and thin patches of stubble dappled his baby-white skin. He wore a gray T-shirt that hung loosely over faded jeans. \"Just make sure your family doesn't ask me to do any magic for them,\" he told Caroline. Yet that night, when Caroline's mother asked him what he did for work, Mystery launched into a spectacular performance. He introduced each illusion\u2014mind reading, bottle-levitating, self-levitating, sleights of hand\u2014with ten minutes of patter and panache that put every other illu\u00ad sionist I'd seen to shame. He charmed everyone in the room: Caroline's mom was flabbergasted, her younger sister was attracted, and her brother wanted to learn how to levitate chalk to freak out his teachers. In that mo\u00ad ment, I realized that Mystery actually had the skills to achieve his dream of being a superstar daredevil illusionist. After Caroline's family turned in for the night, Mystery asked her if she had any sleeping pills. \"All we have is Tylenol #3, which has codeine,\" Caroline told him. \"That'll work,\" Mystery said. \"Just give me the whole bottle. I have a high tolerance.\" Already thinking like a nurse, Caroline brought him just four pills. But they weren't enough to knock him out. So while Caroline and I slept, Mys\u00ad tery, on a codeine high, stayed up all night writing posts on Mystery's Lounge.

Caroline is Style's Toronto girlfriend, and it must be tough for him. She is really beautiful, but she's got a kid. Style and Caroline look great together, but I understand the limitations too. Damn.

  "89": "her brother and mom for like forty-five minutes. It was fun. I did a rune cast for the mom. Caroline is like my sister. I get that feeling of caring for her and her baby. And it's great to have Style here! Then I took codeine to sleep because they all went to bed at normal hours, and I'm fucked up with my sleeping. But I didn't sleep. I just felt love. Don't get me wrong. I'm fully aware it's the Tylenol I took but, hey, the feeling is good nonetheless. I love this lounge. You guys are super bright. I hope we can all have a huge party one day. And all this will wear off when the codeine gets pissed out, haaa. This is what I want to see happen in the future: I want us to become closer friends\u2014you think we can manage that? Grimble and Twotimer, your game is so different from mine. I want to sarge with both of you sometime to legitimately attempt to understand where you are coming from. Papa, the game you played was fucking mint when you were up here. It was great to do a workshop with you, and you are welcome anytime, man. I don't even mind that you call me every day. I envision this lounge as not being about pickup, but rather about something bigger: life goals. Women are a huge part of that, and we work together to help each other obtain them. However, I'd like to extend our topics to money, social status, and other ambitions. Page 202 186 I think one of life's biggest difficulties is not being able to share your problems honestly. So, state your issues here, and you have a hundred intelligent, trustworthy men who can assist you Also, tell us your goals and ob|ectives. If you don't have any, now is the time to make them. I want to see all of us get our shit together and reach self-fulfillment. Travel, women, money, social status, whatever. Lets assist each other along the way. Lets all work on the same projects and synergize our efforts like a corporation. I want to see Vinigarr5 in his own apartment with a kickass car, coin in the bank, a hot nanny to help care for his kid (a nanny he gets to boink), and a couple girls who love him to death. He should own sections of New York\u2014 nightclubs or whatever. He should be driven around in his own limo. He should run his own escort agency. Papa, you sponge off daddy And the enemy of the best is the good. I want to see you focus as much on wealth as you do on relationship mastery. You have the drive to become a multimillionaire. You need to step out from daddy's financial shadow and dwarf his success. Imagine harnessing your sex drive and using it to create a successful business. This is what I need: I need to complete promotional material to pitch to networks for a one-hour magic special. I need major funding to produce this. I'm not bullshitting or having fame fantasies when I say I can do it. People who have met me know I can play the role all the way. Once I have the special on the air, I can put on a Vegas show. I've designed the show in detail already. Anyone interested in helping? Think of the after-parties! Lets build some\u00ad thing. Lets exploit the fact that I need attention (must do shows) every day or I don't feel normal. This isn't a freebie thing either. I don't believe in that. Work with me, and you'll get paid. Just tell me what your objectives are first so we can work on all our shit together! Gentlemen, lets get down to business. \u2014Mystery 5A former workshop student from Brooklyn, Vinagarr is a single father who earns a living as a driver for an escort service Page 203 187 P.S. I've been reading Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and I want to suggest something related. If you regularly masturbate, you can easily become addicted. This addiction comes in the form of daily regularity that curbs your desire to go out. It also does not allow you to harness your sex drive, which can be used to motivate yourself to work on wealth-building projects. If you aren't getting laid on a regular basis (which happens to all of us from time to time), then don't just choke 'til you're",
  "90": "broke. Set a date with yourself. Only jerk it once a week. If you jerked it today, set the jerk date for seven days from now. If you don't get a girl between then and now, you'll have something to look forward to. Make it a good jerk! Use the best porn and hand lotion. Look forward to it and this will keep you from wasting your life away jerking it daily and focusing constantly on the pain of not having a girlfriend. In the meantime, harness your sex drive and build something. Page 204 The morning after his codeine-high post, Mystery lay slumped in the back\u00ad seat of Caroline's car, wrapped in a blanket and shrouded by a hat pulled low over his eyes. Beyond asking us to drop him off at his family's condo, he didn't say a word, which was rare for him. It reminded me of our Eastern European road trip. Except this time, Mystery wasn't sick\u2014at least not physically. We parked and took the elevator to his sister's apartment on the twen\u00ad tieth floor. It was a cluttered two-bedroom hovel crammed with people. Mystery's mother, a zaftig German woman, sat on a beat-up flower- patterned sofa chair. His sister Martina, her two children, and her husband, Gary, were crammed into a couch next to her. Mystery's father was shut up in his apartment four floors above them, sick with liver disease from a life\u00ad time of drinking. \"Hey, how come you don't have a girl with you?\" Mystery's thirteen- year-old niece, Shalyn, chided him. She knew all about his girls. He often used his nieces as a routine to convey his vulnerable, paternal side to women. He truly loved his nieces and seemed to come back to life a little when he saw them. Mystery's brother-in-law, Gary, played us some pop ballads he had composed. The best of these was a song called \"Casanova's Child,\" which Mystery sang along with at a near-deafening volume. He seemed to identify with the title character. Caroline and I left afterward. The girls chased us all the way to the ele\u00ad vator bank, laughing and screaming, followed by Mystery. Suddenly, a door swung open and a man in a clerical collar gave the girls a steely, conde\u00ad scending stare. \"You shouldn't be making so much noise in the hallway,\" he said. Mystery turned crimson. \"What are you going to do about it?\" he asked. \"Because I think we should. These are young girls. They're having fun.\" \"Well,\" the reverend said. \"They can have fun in a place where they're not disturbing other residents.\" Page 205 189 \"I'll tell you what,\" Mystery snapped. \"I'm going to get a knife, and we'll find out just who exactly should be in the hall when I get back.\" Mystery marched back to the house as the rest of us exchanged con\u00ad cerned looks. Again, I recognized the behavior from our road trip: It re\u00ad minded me of when he'd snapped at the border crossing after I'd told him what to do, triggering his father issues. The reverend slammed the door shut, and Caroline and I slipped away in the confusion. Page 206 I didn't really want to go back to Caroline's. I've lived in cities my whole life. I hate the suburbs. Like Andy Dick, my biggest fear is being bored or boring. Weekend nights weren't made for sitting around watching videos from Blockbuster. But Caroline couldn't stay in Toronto. She didn't want to be away from her son; she didn't want to be a typical teenage mother. So while Caroline played with Carter the next day, I checked my e-mail. Mystery and I had posted a field report about Carly and Caroline a few days earlier, and my inbox was full with messages from kids in North Carolina, Poland, Brazil, Croatia, New Zealand, and beyond. They were looking to me for help just as I had once looked to Mystery. There were also two e-mails from Mystery. In the first, he wrote that he'd gotten into a fight with his sister over the hallway incident: \"She pro\u00ad ceeded to punch me several times. I had to restrain her by grabbing her throat and flipping her to the ground. I then left to go back to my house. I wasn't angry. I just wanted to stop her from attacking me.",
  "91": "Weird, huh?\" The second one read simply: \"I'm crackin' up. I'm hungry, my head hurts, my skin aches, and I've been choking it all day to Kazaa porn. I'm go\u00ad ing to get sleeping pills because if l stay up all night alone, I'll go nuts. I can't wait to disappear. I'm so close to saying fuck it and ending it all. This living thing isn't fun anymore.\" He was losing his mind. And I was stuck in bumblefuck, Ontario, watching Britney Spears in Crossroads with three teenagers, one of whom was supposedly now my girlfriend. The next morning, I had Caroline drive me to Mystery's place. \"Can you stay with me?\" I asked. \"I should really get back to Carter,\" she said. \"I haven't been paying enough attention to him, and I don't want my mom to think I'm being neglectful.\" \"Your mom wants you to go out and be with your friends. You're put\u00ad ting this pressure on yourself.\" She agreed to come inside for an hour. Page 207 191 We walked upstairs to Mystery's apartment and opened the door. He was sitting on his bed watching Steven Spielberg's AI on his computer. He was wearing the same gray T-shirt and jeans I had last seen him in. There were scratches on his arms from his fight with his sister. He turned to me and began to speak. His voice was cold and dispas\u00ad sionate. \"I've been thinking,\" he said. \"The robots in this movie have moti\u00ad vated self-interest. They set objectives and then work to accomplish them. The child robot seeks protection from his mommy. The sex robot chases women. When he's freed from a cage, he sets out to mate with real women again because that's his objective.\" \"Okay.\" I leaned against a computer desk pushed flush against his bed. The room was the size of a large closet. The walls were bare. \"What's your point?\" \"The point is,\" he said, in the same deadened voice, \"what is my objec\u00ad tive? And what is yours? I'm a child robot, a sex robot, and an entertainer robot.\" On the floor in front of his bed was a half-eaten plate of uncooked spaghetti. Shrapnel from the spaghetti sticks was scattered around the room. Nearby were the remnants of a black cordless phone that had been smashed against the floor. The battery dangled helplessly out of the open back. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"I blew up at my sister and my mom. They wouldn't shut up.\" When Mystery\u2014or any PUA\u2014was in a funk, there was only one cure for it: to go out sarging and meet new options. \"Let's get peacocked and go to a strip club tonight,\" I suggested. Strip clubs were Mystery's weakness. He had a list of strip club rules that pretty much guaranteed him at least a phone number every time: among them, befriend the DJ; never pay for a dance or a drink; do not hit on, compli\u00ad ment, or touch a stripper; stick to your material; and change the subject whenever a stripper starts reciting the stories she tells every other guy. \"I don't want to go out,\" he said. \"There's no point.\" He stopped the movie on his computer and began working on a half- finished e-mail. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"I'm e-mailing the students in New York and telling them the seminar's canceled.\" He spoke as if he were on autopilot. \"Why are you doing that?\" I was pissed. I'd put a month of my life on Page 208 192 hold so we could go to New York and Bucharest together. I'd already bought the plane tickets. And now, because of some mixture of Steven Spielberg and codeine after effects, he was bailing out. \"Not enough people. Oh well.\" \"Come on,\" I said. \"You're already making eighteen hundred dollars. And I'm sure more guys will sign up at the last minute. It's New York, for chrissake. No one commits to anything in advance.\" \"Living,\" he sighed, \"costs too much.\" It was all too melodramatic for me. The guy was a black hole sucking up attention. Fuck him. \"You are so fucking selfish,\" I seethed. \"What about our tickets to Bucharest?\" \"You can go if you want. I'm canceling all shows, all agents, all semi\u00ad nars, all workshops, all trips. I'm stopping everything. I don't want to be known for being a",
  "92": "Ross Jeffries.\" I gave his dresser a mule kick from behind. I have a long fuse, but when it hits bottom I explode. Though my father may not have taught me much about women, he did teach me that. An orange prescription bottle hit the floor, scattering pills. I picked it up and looked at it. The word Rivotril was on the label. \"What are these?\" \"They're my sister's anti-depressant pills. They really aren't about deal\u00ad ing with depression so much as making me sleep.\" Cold. Clinical. I figured they couldn't be doing much good. So I left three in the bottle and stuffed the rest in my pocket. I didn't want him overdosing. Mystery logged on to Party Poker, an online gambling site, and started playing mechanically. The Mystery I knew was too logical to gamble. \"What are you doing?\" I said. But I didn't wait for an answer. \"Never mind.\" I slammed the door behind me and found Caroline in the front room. \"Let's go back to your house,\" I told her. She smiled weakly, sympathetically. She didn't know what to say. In that moment, I hated her. She just seemed so useless. Page 209 So I went back to Caroline's house in the suburbs\u2014to her mother and her brother and her sister and her son and her Britney Spears movies. I could tell I was becoming a burden to her and a distraction from her son. And she could tell she was becoming a bore to me. It wasn't her con\u00ad stant fretting over her son I minded; it was her complete lack of initiative. The days and nights spent imprisoned in her house doing nothing were get\u00ad ting to me. I refuse to take time for granted. One of the primary rules of pickup is that a girl can fall out of love with you as quickly as she falls in love with you. It happens every night. The girls who start rubbing your chest and making out with you in a club in two minutes will leave you just as quickly for a bigger, better deal. That's the game. That's life in the field. And I understood that. During a workshop in San Francisco, I'd spent the night at the house of a lawyer named Anne. On her nightstand there was a thin book by a guy named Joel Kramer. Unable to sleep, I picked it up and leafed through the pages. He explained the emotions Caroline and I were feeling best: We have this idea that love is supposed to last forever. But love isn't like that. It's a free-flowing energy that comes and goes when it pleases. Sometimes it stays for life; other times it stays for a second, a day, a month, or a year. So don't fear love when it comes simply because it makes you vulnerable. But don't be surprised when it leaves, either. Just be glad you had the opportunity to experience it. I'm very loosely paraphrasing, but his ideas reverberated in my head as I spent yet another night in bed with Caroline. I had originally memorized the passage to use as a routine. I never thought it would actually apply to my own life. Love was supposed to be something women chased, not men. I spent the next day juggling airplane tickets and travel plans. I kept my flight to Eastern Europe, but instead of watching Mystery hunt for bisexual slave girls, I decided to meet a group of PUAs operating out of Croatia. I'd been corresponding with one of them, named Badboy, since the day I'd joined the community. Page 210 194 One of the reasons I became a writer is that, unlike starting a band, di\u00ad recting movies, or acting in a theatrical production, you can do it alone. Your success and failure depend entirely on yourself. I've never trusted col\u00ad laborations, because most people in this world are not closers. They don't finish what they start; they don't live what they dream; they sabotage their own progress because they're afraid they won't find what they seek. I had idolized Mystery. I had wanted to be him. But, like most everyone else\u2014 perhaps more than most\u2014he was his own worst enemy. When I checked the seduction boards that day, there was one new mes\u00ad sage from Mystery. Its title: Mystery's Last Post. I won't be posting here anymore. Just wanted to say thanks",
  "93": "for the memo\u00ad ries and good luck to you all. Your friend, Mystery I went to Mystery's website, and it had been taken down already. It's impressive how quickly years of work and effort can be dismantled. An hour later, my cell phone rang. It was Papa. \"I'm scared,\" he said. \"So am I,\" I told him. \"I don't know whether this is just a cry for atten\u00ad tion or the real thing.\" \"I feel the same way as Mystery.\" His voice was distant and weak. \"My life is going all the way down. All I am is game. I haven't opened a book since school started. And I need to get accepted into law school.\" Papa wasn't an exception. There was something about the community that took over people's lives. Especially now. Before Mystery started doing workshops, it was just an online addiction. Now everyone was flying around the country meeting and sarging together. It wasn't just a lifestyle; it was a disease. The more time you devoted to it, the better you got. And the better you got, the more addictive it became. Guys who had never been to clubs could now walk in, be superstars, and leave with pockets full of phone numbers and girls on their arms. And then, as icing on the cake, they could write a field report and brag about it to everyone else in the commu\u00ad nity. There were people who were quitting their jobs and dropping out of school in order to master the game. Such was the power and lure of success with women. Page 211 195 \"One of the things that attracts a woman is lifestyle and success,\" I told Papa. \"Imagine how easy the game would be if you were a high-powered en\u00ad tertainment lawyer with celebrity clients. By getting into a good law school, you'll be improving your game.\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I need to prioritize. I love the game, but it's become too much of a drug for me now.\" Mystery's depression was affecting not just his own life, but the lives of the kids who looked up to him and modeled themselves after him. Some, like Papa, were still modeling him, even in his downward spiral. \"Everyone who gets too absorbed in the game is depressed,\" Papa said. \"Ross Jeffries, Mystery, me. I want Mystery's game, but not at the expense of life.\" The problem was that this epiphany was coming too late for Papa. He'd already signed up for seminars with David X and David DeAngelo. All of it, of course, meant blowing off days of classes. \"My dad called yesterday,\" Papa continued. \"He's really worried about me. All I've been doing is game for half a year while ignoring my education, finances, and family.\" \"You have to learn balance, man. Pickup should just be a glorified hobby.\" It was wise advice\u2014advice I should have been following myself. After I hung up, I called Mystery. He wanted to give me his motorcycle. He wanted to give Patricia his computer. And he wanted to give the illu\u00ad sions he had designed for his ninety-minute show to a local magician. \"You can't give away the magic tricks you've worked so hard on,\" I protested. \"You may want them later.\" \"Those are illusions. I'm not good at anything but bullshitting people. I never meant to be a bullshitter, so I'm stopping now.\" I didn't need to be a high-school guidance counselor to recognize the warning signs. If I didn't take them seriously, I might regret it later. I couldn't turn the other way while my mentor walked off a cliff\u2014even if it was a cliff of his own making. I once had a friend whose ex-boyfriend was al\u00ad ways threatening to kill himself. One day she didn't respond to his cry for help. He shot himself on his front lawn an hour later. As Mystery had noted in his codeine-high Lounge post, we had a valu\u00ad able network at our disposal. The Lounge linked together surgeons, stu\u00ad dents, bodyguards, movie directors, fitness trainers, software developers, concierges, stockbrokers, and psychiatrists. So I called Doc. Page 212 196 Doc had discovered the community when Mystery signed up, on a lark, for a dating seminar Doc was conducting at the Learning Annex. Mystery listened patiently as Doc shared tips and",
  "94": "tactics that were AFC stuff com\u00ad pared to the technology in the community. Afterward, he talked to Doc, who confessed to not being much of a ladies' man. So Mystery took him out for a night on the town, schooled him in Mystery Method, and gave him access to the Lounge. Now Doc was a machine, with his own harem of women. His nickname came from his doctorate in psychology, so I called him and asked for advice. He suggested asking Mystery the following questions, in exactly this order: \u2022 Are you so down that you just feel like giving up on everything? \u2022 Are you thinking about death a lot? \u2022 Do you think about hurting yourself or doing something destructive? \u2022 Are you thinking about suicide? \u2022 How would you do it? \u2022 What keeps you from doing it? \u2022 Do you think you would do it within the next twenty-four hours? I wrote down the questions on a sheet of paper, folded it in quarters, and put it in my back pocket. This would be my cheat sheet. My routine. Page 213 When I arrived at Mystery's place, he was in the process of dismantling his bed. His movements were mechanical. So were his responses. STYLE: What are you doing? MYSTERY: I'm giving my bed to my sister. I love her, and she deserves a better bed. STYLE: Are you so down that you just feel like giving up on everything? MYSTERY: Yes. It's the futility of it. It's memetic. If you understand memetics, then you understand that it's all futile. There's no point. STYLE: But you have a superior intellect. It's your duty to breed. MYSTERY: It doesn't matter. I'm going to weed my genes out of existence. STYLE: Are you thinking about death a lot? MYSTERY: All the time. STYLE: Do you think about hurting yourself or doing something destructive? MYSTERY: Yes. This living thing is fubar. STYLE: Are you thinking about suicide? MYSTERY: Yes. STYLE: How would you do it? MYSTERY: Drowning, because it's what I'm most afraid of. STYLE: What keeps you from doing it? MYSTERY: I have to give away all my stuff. I dropped Patricia's computer and broke it. So I want to give her mine. She needs a computer. Page 214 STYLE: Did she care? MYSTERY: No, not really. STYLE: Was she mad that you broke it? MYSTERY: No. STYLE: Do you think you would take your life in the next twenty-four hours? MYSTERY: Why are you asking me all these questions? STYLE: Because I'm your friend, and I'm worried about you. [Doorbell rings] STYLE: Who is it? VOICE ON INTERCOM Hi, this is Tyler Durden. I'm here for Mystery. I'm a fan of his posts, and I want to see if l can meet him. STYLE: It's probably not a good time right now. VOICE ON INTERCOM But I came all the way from Kingston. STYLE: Sorry, man. He can't see anyone. He's, um, sick. Page 215 I left Mystery in his room, went to the kitchen, and dialed information for his parents' number. His real-world name was Erik von Markovik, but that was just another illusion. He'd legally changed it from his birth name, Erik Horvat-Markovic. The phone rang once, twice, a third time. A man picked up. His voice was gruff, his manner curt. It was Mystery's father. \"Hi, I'm friends with your son, Erik.\" \"Who are you?\" \"I'm Neil, Erik's friend. And I wanted to ...\" \"Don't call here again!\" he barked. \"But he needs ...\" Click. The asshole hung up. There was only one other person I could call. I returned to Mystery's room. He was washing a pill down with a glass of water. His face was red and twisted, as if he were crying invisible tears. \"What did you just take?\" I asked. \"Some sleeping pills,\" he said. \"How many?\" Fuck. I was going to have to call an ambulance. \"Two.\" \"Why'd you take them?\" \"When I'm awake, life sucks. It's futile. When I'm asleep, I dream.\" He was starting to sound like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. \"I dreamed last night that I was in a flying DeLorean. Like the one in Back to the Future. And there were all these wires around us. I was with my sister. And she was driving. We went above the wires. And I saw my life below them.\" \"Listen,\" I said. \"I need Patricia's phone",
  "95": "number.\" The tears came now. He looked like a big baby. A big baby who was about to kill himself. \"Can you tell me Patricia's phone number?\" I asked again slowly, gen\u00ad tly, as if speaking to a child. He gave it to me\u2014slowly, gently, like a child. Page 216 I hoped that Patricia wouldn't hang up on me, that she hadn't cut Mys\u00ad tery out of her life entirely, that she'd have a solution. She answered on the first ring. As a girlfriend, she had been taken for granted by Mystery. But in reality she was part of an invisible support sys\u00ad tem. Her stabilizing effect wasn't noticed until she was gone. Patricia's voice was a little masculine, with a light Romanian accent. She didn't seem overly intelligent, but she cared about Mystery. There was compassion and concern in her voice. \"He's tried to kill himself before,\" she said. \"The best thing you can do is call his mother or his sister. They'll probably put him in an institution.\" \"Forever?\" \"No, just until he gets through it.\" The door to Mystery's room swung open. Mystery emerged. He walked past me toward the door. \"Hey!\" I yelled at him. \"Where are you going?\" He turned back for a moment and looked at me through blank, emo\u00ad tionless eyes. \"Good knowing you, buddy,\" he said, then turned away. \"Where are you going?\" I repeated. \"I'm going to shoot my father and then kill myself were his last words as he opened the front door to the house and closed it gently behind him. Page 217 I chased after Mystery. He was descending the stairs slowly, as if sleepwalk\u00ad ing. I shot ahead of him and barred the lobby door in front of him. \"Hey.\" I tugged at his sleeve. \"Let's go back upstairs. I talked to your sis\u00ad ter. She's coming to get you. Just wait a couple more minutes.\" He hesitated for a moment, unsure whether to trust me or not. He was so docile, he didn't seem like he would hurt a fly. I shooed him up\u00ad stairs with gentle whispers of encouragement. As he turned and walked, I called his family again. \"He'll be okay,\" I thought, \"as long as his father doesn't answer.\" His mother answered. She said she'd be there within a half hour. Mystery sat on a futon in his kitchen and waited. The sleeping pills must have kicked in. He stared at the wall and mumbled strands of evolu\u00ad tionary philosophy, memetics, and game theory. The conclusion of his mutterings was always the same: the words \"futile\" or \"fubar.\" His mother arrived with his sister in tow. The moment they saw him, they went ashen. \"I had no idea it had gotten this serious,\" Martina said. She packed him a suitcase while his mother brought him downstairs. He followed passively, dead to the world. They left the building and headed toward a car that would soon take him to the psychiatric ward of the Humber River Regional Hospital. As Mystery's mother opened the door for him, a four-set of girls poured out of an SUV parked in front of them. For a moment, a spark of life flickered in Mystery's eyes. I watched him, hoping to hear him say those six magical words: \"Is this your set or mine?\" Then I'd know everything would be okay. But his eyes went dead again. His mother helped lower him into the car. She picked up his legs and moved them inside, then slammed the door shut. I saw him through the glass, the smiling blonde four-set reflected against his face. His complexion was pale and bloodless. He stared blankly Page 218 202 ahead, his mouth closed, his jaw set, his sharp labret piercing angrily glint\u00ad ing in the cold afternoon light. The girls were looking at the menu of a sushi restaurant. They giggled. It was a beautiful sound. It was the sound of life. I hoped Mystery could hear it. Page 219 Mystery's breakdown triggered a crisis of faith and self-examination in the community. We were all submerged so deep in the game that it was fucking with our lives. Papa was failing out of school. A San Francisco PUA named Adonis had been fired from his advertising job when they discovered how much time he'd been spending on Mystery's Lounge. And my writing",
  "96": "had come to a near-standstill. Even Vision had become so addicted to the seduction news\u00ad groups that he gave his DSL cable to his roommate and ordered, \"Don't give these back to me for two weeks.\" Meanwhile, the community was growing exponentially. More and more newbies were flocking to the boards. They were young kids\u2014some of them still in high school\u2014and they looked to us PUAs for advice on not just seduction and socializing but everything. They wanted to know what col\u00ad lege to apply to; if they should stop taking prescribed psychiatric medica\u00ad tion; if they should masturbate, wear condoms, do drugs, run away from home. They wanted to know what to read, think, and do to be like us. One of those lost souls was a short, well-muscled Lebanese student in his early twenties known as Prizer. He was from El Paso and had never even kissed a girl. He wanted advice on how to get comfortable around women, so we told him that first he needed to make female friends. And, second, he needed to experience sex, and not be too picky about a partner. He took us a little too literally. Witness a few choice excerpts from his field reports: MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014Losing My Virginity in Juarez AUTHOR: Prizer I decided to see how it actually felt to have sex, so I crossed the border to Juarez Since she was a hooker, I guess its not technically a pickup. But I think this will help my game because I'll be less desperate I had trouble keeping Page 220 204 hard, except I got excited when I was going down on her and doing sixty- nine. It was my first time for all of that. Now that I'm not a virgin, do you think girls will find me more attractive? MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014Another Night in Juarez AUTHOR: Prizer I had sex again in Juarez. This makes four hookers for me now. She even swal\u00ad lowed my cum, but I still haven't been able to ejaculate during intercourse. Is this normal? Anyway, what I did this time to help my game is I pretended like she was my girlfriend. But when I wanted to eat her ass out, she charged me an extra five bucks. That was lame Anyway, I'm writing this report because I'm thinking that it might improve my sarging more if I spend my money on hookers in Juarez for maybe six months instead of on workshops and e-books and shit. Its much more direct. Do you think that having more sex can raise your game and your confidence level? After everyone in the community chastised Prizer for posting field re\u00ad ports about prostitutes, he was the first to turn to me for help. Then came a note from Cityprc in Rhode Island. Then came pleas from a dozen others I'd never met. They were all offering me money to teach them seduction. They wanted to fly in; they wanted to fly me out; they were willing to pay any price just to watch a real PUA in action. With Mystery confined to the psychiatric wing of Humber Hospital and Juggler so deep in his LTR that he had taken down his website, the students were hungry. And somehow I had become their new guru. All those posts where I'd explained my routines and discussed my nights out hadn't just been a way of learning and sharing; they'd also been a form of advertising. But seduction is a dark art. Its secrets come with a price and we were all paying it, whether in sanity, school, work, time, money, health, morality, or loss of self. We may have been supermen in the club, but on the inside we were rotting. \"I was modeling myself after you and Mystery,\" Papa said when I called to check on him. \"I need to be me. I have so much potential for success, and I'm blowing it all. I used to be a straight A student.\" Page 221 205 He planned to go cold turkey on seduction and, for starters, cancel the seminars he'd already signed up for. \"I'll also stop calling HBs until I get my life in order,\" he said. \"If they call me, I'll tell them I need to get my life straight before I sarge them. I choose life. I will not be game.\" \"You have to treat school and studying like you treat",
  "97": "seduction.\" \"Yes,\" he said, as if he'd just had an epiphany. \"I will make school wings. I will make study pivots. I will fuck-close my tests.\" \"That may be taking it a little too far. But, um, good for you.\" \"I feel free,\" he said. \"Whoa.\" And I'd like to say that's how we all felt, that we all realized we'd be\u00ad come too consumed and came to our senses, that we put our lives in bal\u00ad ance and got our priorities straight, that we relegated seduction to a glorified hobby. But there is a concept in hypnosis called fractionation. And it states that if a person under hypnosis is brought out of trance and then put back under, the trance will be even deeper and more powerful. And so it was with seduction. We all came out of it for a moment\u2014we opened our eyes and saw the light of the real world. But then we went back under, deeper than we ever were before\u2014and to an extent beyond what any of us could have imagined. Page 223 STEP 6 CREATE AN EMOTIONAL Page 224 PEOPLE USED TO LOOK OUT ON THE PLAYGROUND AND SAY THAT THE BOYS WERE PLAYING SOCCERAND THE GIRLS WERE DOING NOTHING. BUT THE GIRLS WEREN'T DOING NOTHING\u2014THEY WERE TALKING. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WORLD TO ONE ANOTHER. AND THEY BECAME VERY EXPERT ABOUT THAT IN A WAY THE BOYS DID NOT. CAROL GILLIGAN, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development Page 225 Petra was a nineteen-year-old Czech with long chestnut hair, a thin golden- brown model's body, and no more than a dozen words of English in her vo\u00ad cabulary. I met her and her cousin on the island of Hvar in Croatia with a Seattle PUA named Nightlight9. We showed them our magic tricks. They showed us their popcorn. On a piece of paper, we drew a picture with a clock and a time on it to rendezvous that night. They met us and led us by the hand to a small, deserted beach. They took off all their clothes except their panties and tennis shoes, and ran into the water. We followed and made love to them as they chattered away in Czech to each other. Anya was a whip-smart twenty-two-year-old Croatian who was vaca\u00ad tioning with her younger sister. She oozed confidence, sensuality, and good breeding; her sister was the opposite. Nightlight9 and I met them on the beach in the Croatian town of Vodice. That night they slipped away from their parents, and we wandered along the waterfront until we found a docked sailboat. We snuck on board and had sex in the galley. I left twenty euros for the bottle of wine we drank. Carrie was a nineteen-year-old waitress at Dublin's in Los Angeles. She approached me and complimented me on my dreadlocks; I neglected to tell her I was wearing a Rastafarian wig as a joke. I met her the next day com\u00ad pletely bald, but we still ended up in bed together. When I e-mailed her the next day to tell her she'd left her rings at my house, she responded, \"I don't wear rings. They're not mine.\" Martine was a free-spirited blonde I met in New York, with milky skin, smeared red lipstick, and an iron-on T-shirt. I'd opened so many sets that I can't even remember what I said to her. The next night, we went to a bar. I brought along two other girls so she'd have to work for me. For a second I felt guilty about that. But only a second. In the bar, I asked her how good she was in bed, on a scale of one to ten. In my hotel room, I found out. She was a seven. Laranya was a JAP in the body of an Indian woman. I'd met her when I was in college and we were both interning at the same weekly newspaper. Page 226 210 She was the hot intern; I was the shy intern. But when I ran into her years later in Los Angeles, Style took her out on the town. The first thing she said when we woke up together was, \"I can't believe how much you've changed.\" Neither could I. Stacy was a twenty-eight-year-old anorexic I met in Chicago. During a lengthy e-mail correspondence, she seduced me with her intelligence, can\u00ad dor, and poetry. When she finally came to visit, I was disappointed to dis\u00ad cover that she was awkward and ineloquent.",
  "98": "She probably felt the same way about me. Nonetheless, I brought her directly to my bedroom, and we be\u00ad gan to make out. I put a finger inside her and felt a fleshy cord bisecting her vagina like a tennis net. It was her hymen. I told her I didn't want to be the one to take her virginity. That's when I realized that being a PUA sometimes meant saying no. Yana was an older Russian woman with chiseled features and a great boob job. I met her at a bar in Malibu. She told me it was her birthday but wouldn't say her age. I guessed forty-five, but not out loud. As a present, I told her I'd be her boy toy. She grabbed my butt; I told her I charged extra for that. Two nights later, we had a cocktail and adjourned to my house. She said she didn't put out anymore, that she was looking for something deeper. We had sex that night. We role-played. I was the teacher; she was the naughty schoolgirl. It was her idea. She was a drunk Asian girl with large breasts, surrounded by three sober Asian girls with small breasts. I can't remember her name. She thought I was gay. We talked for fifteen minutes, then I took her by the hand and led her to the bathroom. We gave each other oral sex and never spoke again. It was overrated. Jill was an Australian businesswoman a fellow pickup artist set me up with. She had spiky blonde hair, leopard-print pants, and a voracious sexual energy. When she danced\u2014if you could call it that\u2014every man's head turned. We fucked in her BMW, with the top down and our legs out the door. When I asked her when she had first wanted to kiss me, she said, \"As soon as I saw you.\" No woman had ever said that to me before. Sarah was a forty something casting agent I met at the lounge of the Casa Del Mar hotel in Santa Monica. She looked clean and radiant, like she had stepped out of a shampoo commercial\u2014even in the harsh light of my elevator, where, an hour after meeting, we made love. She kept asking if there were cameras. I couldn't tell if she was afraid of being caught or ex\u00ad cited by the possibility. Probably both. Page 227 211 Hea and Randi were girls I met at the club Highlands. Hea was a teeny indie-rocker nerd with a boyfriend. Randi was a cute actress with the most mischievous smile I'd ever seen, and a boyfriend. It took a month to con\u00ad vince Hea to cheat on her boyfriend; it took a day to convince Randi. Mika was a Japanese girl I met at Jamba Juice. She was an orange dream machine with energy boost. I am an orange dream machine with protein boost. I was intrigued. When we had sex, I discovered that she didn't believe in shaving her pubic hair. The next morning she told me, \"I grow my hair out because I donate it to children with cancer.\" I was astonished: \"They wear your pubes on their head?\" She replied that she'd been talking about the hair on her head. Ani was a stripper who worked out two hours a day and was addicted to plastic surgery. She had metallic red hair and lipstick tattooed on to match. After we had sex, she told me, \"I have mastered the art of visualization.\" When I asked her to elaborate, she told me that since men are so visual, she makes sure that everything she does in bed looks hot. But when she devel\u00ad oped feelings for me, she discovered that she was no longer able to have sex because the emotions opened wounds from childhood abuse. The visualiza\u00ad tions ended. Maya was a black-haired goth belly dancer I flirted with at one of her performances. When our paths crossed months later, she still remembered me. I invited her over the next night. Her car was in the shop, so I offered to pay for a cab. She was there in a half hour. Alexis was a clothing store manager who looked like she should have been in an eighties new-wave band. Susanna was a recently divorced de\u00ad signer who wanted to rediscover her sexuality. Doris was a married woman whose sex life had died. Nadia was a librarian who had the skills of a porn star; I guess you can learn a lot from books. All four were the result of an ex\u00ad periment: I",
  "99": "tried to concoct the perfect routine for the personals. After sev\u00ad eral failures, I succeeded. The secret, I learned, was to seem like a selfish prick in the ad, and then be a fascinating, laid-back gentleman on meeting. Maggie and Linda were sisters; they're no longer talking to each other. Anne was a French girl who didn't speak a word of English. Jessica was a bookworm I met on jury duty. Faryal helped me call a tow truck when my car broke down. Stef was handing out flyers for a strip club on Sunset Boulevard. Susan was a friend's sister. Tanya was a neighbor. My wish had come true. Women were no longer a challenge. They were a pleasure. Page 228 212 In the months since Mystery's breakdown, I'd turned a new corner in my game. Once I'd gotten the number of a woman, it was easy to meet and have sex with her. In the past, I was too obsessed with trying to get some to actually take a step back, assess the situation, and act appropriately. Now, after a year of accumulating knowledge and experience, I had finally gotten out of my own head. I understood the process of attraction and the signals women gave. I saw the big picture. When talking to a woman, I could recognize the specific point when she became attracted to me, even if she was acting distant or felt uncom\u00ad fortable. I knew when to talk and when to shut up; when to push and when to pull; when to tease and when to be sincere; when to kiss and when to say we were moving too fast. Whatever test, challenge, or objection a woman threw my way, I knew how to respond. When Maya the belly dancer wrote and said, \"Thanks for the multiple orgasms. Call and we can discuss when you'll be taking me out for dinner. You owe me for the cab ride, and I feel like being taken out on a real date,\" I didn't assume she was a bitch or pushy at all. She just trying to get validation for having put out so quickly and testing to see how much she could control me. I didn't even need to think about the response. \"I'll tell you what,\" I wrote. \"I'll pay you back for the cab, like I prom\u00ad ised, and then you can take me out to dinner in exchange for all those or\u00ad gasms.\" She took me out to dinner. I saw the matrix. I was Mystery. Page 229 WHO IS THE BEST PUA? BY THUNDERCAT FROM THUNDERCAT'S SEDUCTION LAIR Okay, so the debate has been raging for a while now over who is the best pickup artist out there. Obviously, a lot of egos are involved in this assessment, and everyone has their own opinions about who the best really is. In fact, its so subjective that I don't really think there will ever be a clear and honest answer on the subject. Its like asking who the best warrior or soldier is in a war. But that doesn't stop some people from categorizing the guys in our little community as the best. So I've decided to rate the top PUAs operating out there. Style is definitely, hands down, the best operating in the game today. This guy is probably the most evil, sneaky, manipulative bastard I have ever seen in operation. The thing is, this guy comes in totally under the radar, and that is why he is so dangerous. His subtlety is so amazing that before you know if, you are qualifying yourself to him and he has you right where he wants you. And the thing is, he does if with both girls and guys. No one is safe. To give you an idea of how incredible Style is, he's invented most of the techniques a lot of the fop guys are using and teaching. He is practically Machiavellian in nature and is someone I both admire and fear. Add to this the fact that he's a rather average-looking guy, and you have the most powerful of the Jedi, bar none. Page 230 It was when I went to Croatia after Mystery's breakdown that I realized everything had changed. I was no longer in the game to meet women; I was in the game to lead men. Two of the Croatian pickup artists I was staying with had even shaved their head in emulation of pictures of me they had seen online. Despite my aversion to being a guru, I had clearly become one. When I talked",
  "100": "to a woman, the room went silent. The guys leaned in close to hear what I was saying, pulling out notebooks to write my words down and com\u00ad mit them to memory. On returning home, I watched Ross Jeffries run a variation of my jeal\u00ad ous girlfriend opener (about the woman who doesn't want her boyfriend to speak to his ex from college), followed by a false time constraint. Afterward, he even e-mailed and asked for a copy of my evolution phase-shift routine. He was modeling me. And he planned on sharing these techniques in his seminars. Then Thundercat's PUA ranking came out, and I was number one. I could no longer claim to be a student. Neil Strauss was officially dead. In the eyes of these men, I was Style, the king of the unnaturals. All over the world people were using my jokes, my comebacks, my lines, my words to meet, kiss, and fuck girls. I had overshot my goal. In the old days, I was just Mystery's wing or Ross's disciple or Steve P.'s hypnotic subject. Now I had to prove myself every time I went out. Guys in the community would ask behind my back, \"How is Style? Is he any good?\" If I didn't walk up to a group of girls and make out with the hottest one within fifteen minutes, they'd think I was a fraud. Before I joined the com\u00ad munity, I had been afraid of failing in front of women. Now I was afraid of failing in front of men. And the pressure ran both ways: I also began to develop unreasonable expectations of myself. If I was at an Italian restaurant and there was an al\u00ad luring woman five tables away, I felt like a failure if I didn't sarge her. If I Page 231 215 was walking to the dry cleaners and an aspiring actress-model-waitress passed by, I felt like a hypocrite if I didn't open her. And where simply talk\u00ad ing to a stranger was enough to elate me in my AFC days, now I needed to have her in my bed within a week. Though I knew my new mindset was seriously warped, I felt more ethi\u00ad cal in many ways as a PUA than I had been as an AFC. Part of learning game was not just memorizing openers and phone game and rapport-building tactics, but learning how to be honest with a woman about what I expected from her and what she could expect from me. It was no longer necessary to deceive a woman by telling her I wanted a relationship when I just wanted to get laid; by pretending to be her friend when I only wanted to get in her pants; by letting her think we were in a monogamous relationship when I was seeing other women. I had finally internalized the idea that women don't always want rela\u00ad tionships. In fact, once unleashed, a woman's physical needs are often more ravenous than a man's. It's just that there are certain barriers and programming walls to be overcome in order for her to feel comfortable enough to surrender to them. I got good at the game because I understood that the goal of the PUA was simply not to trigger a woman's shutdown or flight responses. [As I write this, I look up and, I swear to God, there is a girl on top of me. She has blonde hair and a sleeveless undershirt with a black bra under\u00ad neath. She is smiling at me. I am inside her. She is biting her lower lip as she rubs her clit against my pelvic bone. I can hear her gasping. She is supporting herself with one hand on my thigh and the other lightly resting on the top of the computer. \"You know it turns me on when you click the typewriter,\" she just said. \"Can I put you in my mouth for a minute?\" So fuck the stereotypical image of the writer. This is the new one. I can get work done and play at the same time. It reminds me of sometlkhing Steve P. said, about always being in your own reality. Everyone is jus a guest in it. So if it's my work time, and you want to have sex with me, well,e wel\u00ad come to my reality. I think she's about to come. She is coming allksd;Good for her.]6 This portion of the text has not been edited in order to preserve its authenticity. Page 232 216 So every part of the pickup is designed simply to anticipate and disarm objections\u2014at",
  "101": "least, when we're talking about solid game as opposed to fool's mate. The opener, for example, is casual. It is not perceived as a pickup at\u00ad tempt. You are just being a friendly stranger when you walk up and ask her and her friends, \"My neighbor just bought two dogs, and she wants to name them after an eighties or nineties pop duo. Do you have any ideas?\" When you start talking to a group of people, their first concern is, \"Are we going to be stuck with this guy all night? How do we get rid of him?\" So you give yourself a false time constraint. \"I can only stay for a minute,\" you tell them as you join their group, \"because I need to get back to my friends.\" As you interact, you pay attention to the people who seem most likely to shut you out\u2014the jealous men, the overprotective friends. You make them feel good about themselves as you challenge, tease, and neg the target. If she interrupts you, for example, say, \"Wow. Is she always like that? How do you deal with her?\" If she looks shocked, you reel her back in with a light compliment. This is what I call push-pull\u2014keeping her guessing by pushing her away and then quickly pulling her in closer. After they're finished giving opinions on names for the dogs (Milli and Vanilli, Hall and Oates, Dre and Snoop\u2014I've heard them all), then you demonstrate value. You give the girls the best friends test or teach them something about their body language or analyze their handwriting. Then you pretend like you have to get back to your friends. Now they don't want you to leave. You are in. You've shown them that you're the most interesting, fun person in the room. This is the hook point: You can now relax and enjoy their company. You can listen to them, find out about their lives, and make a real connection. In a best-case scenario, you can take the group or your target on an in\u00ad stant date to another bar, club, cafe, or party. Now you're part of the group. You may relax, tease, enjoy, and bond with your target, who is becoming at\u00ad tracted to you after the negging and after leading her group. When it comes time to leave, tell the group you lost your friends and need a ride home. This will give the woman an opportunity to be alone with you without let\u00ad ting her friends know she plans to sleep with you. (If the logistics are too difficult, get her number and make a plan to hang out later in the week.) When she pulls up to your house, invite her in to show her that thing Page 233 217 you were talking about (a website, a song, a book, a movie clip, a shirt, a bowling ball, whatever). But first, give her another false time constraint: Tell her you have to get to sleep early because you have a lot of work tomor\u00ad row. Say, \"You can only come in for fifteen minutes, and then I'm going to have to kick you out.\" By this point, you both may know you're going to have sex, but you still have to play solid game so she can tell herself later that it just happened. Show her around the house. Get her a drink. Tell her you're dying to play her a really funny five-minute video clip. Unfortunately, the TV in your living room is broken, but there's one in your bedroom. Of course, there are no chairs in your bedroom, only a bed. When she sits on the bed, position yourself as far away from her as possible. Allow her to feel comfortable, perhaps even confused that you're not hitting on her. If you touch her, pull back afterward. Continue using a combination of time constraints and push-pull to amp her attraction. Keep telling her she has to leave soon. Then, at your leisure, tell her she smells nice. Sniff her slowly, from the bottom of her neck to just below her ear. This is when you use the evolution phase-shift routine: smell her, bite her arm, let her bite your neck, bite her neck, and then kiss. Unless she attacks you with lust, as you physically esca\u00ad late continue talking to keep her mind occupied and pulling back just be\u00ad fore she starts to get uncomfortable. You should always be the first one to object.",
  "102": "This is called stealing her frame. The goal now is simply to arouse her without making her feel pressured, used, or uneasy. You make out, you remove her shirt, she removes your shirt, you start to remove her bra. What's this? She's stopping you from going any further? The PUAs have a name for this\u2014last minute resistance, or LMR. Back up one or two steps, then continue. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's not real. It's just ASD\u2014anti-slut defense. She doesn't want you to think she's easy. So you cuddle, you talk. She asks dumb questions like how many siblings you have; you answer honestly and make her feel comfortable again. Then you start from the top: You make out, then remove her bra. She lets you this time. You suck her breasts. She arches her back. She is aroused now. She gets on top of you and starts grinding. You are hard. You are excited. You want her. You lift her off and begin to unbutton her pants. She pulls your hand away. \"You're right, this is so bad,\" you agree, breathing heavily into her ear. We shouldn't be doing this.\" Page 234 218 You make out more. You reach for the pants again. Wash, rinse, repeat. But she still stops you. So you blow out the candles, turn on the light, turn off the music, and ruin the atmosphere. Then you grab your laptop com\u00ad puter and check your e-mail while she lies there confused. This is called a freeze-out. She was feeling good a moment ago, enjoying your attention, your touch, and the intimacy of the room; now you're taking it all away. She rolls over and starts kissing your chest, trying to reel you back in. You put down your computer, turn off the light, and return her affection. You reach for her pants. She stops you. She says you just met. You tell her that you understand. You turn the light on again. She asks what you're doing. You tell her that when a woman says no, you respect that, but it just pushes a but\u00ad ton in you that turns everything off. You are not upset. You tell her this in a matter-of-fact voice. She rolls on top of you and whines, playfully, \"No.\" She wants to have sex. All she wants to know is that you're going to call her afterward, so that she feels good about what she did\u2014even if she doesn't actually want to see you again. You let her know that. You tell her, \"Take off your pants.\" She does. You enjoy yourselves and give each other many orgasms over the course of the night, the morning, and perhaps even for years afterward. One morning, she asks you how many women you've been with. This is the only time you're allowed to lie. Page 235 As a community, we had reached a new height of arrogance. \"I'm starting to feel like I'm hunting rabbits with a howitzer,\" Mad- dash, a former student, told me. He had just returned from pulling off one of the most unlikely sarges in community history. A Chicago office worker named Jackie Kim had acci\u00ad dentally forwarded her highly judgmental review of a date to her entire ad\u00ad dress book. It was just as shallow as the field reports of some PUAs. \"So where do I stand on ... the date,\" she wrote. \"The car, the money, the job, the cute apartment, the boat\u2014which by the way only seats six peo\u00ad ple, so I really don't consider that really amazing\u2014his mannerism, and his great kiss will probably lock in another date. But I can tell you now, unless he cuts his hair and sends me gifts, it won't lead me to seek anything more than my first thirty-year-old friend.\" The post became an Internet phenomenon, forwarded around the globe and chronicled in the Chicago Tribune. One person who received the e-mail was Maddash, who promptly sent her a sympathetic response. Jackie wrote him back, saying the e-mail made her day and she read it every time she received a hate letter. A few e-mails, an exchange of photos, and one date later, she was in Maddash's bed. It took no gifts, no boats, no hair\u00ad cut. Just pure seduction. Maddash's success set off a rash of copycat sarges in the community. Suddenly, just going out to a bar and bringing a girl home seemed too",
  "103": "ordi\u00ad nary and easy. Vision called an escort and paid her $350 for an hour. His goal was to be so interesting and seductive that she would pay him to spend the next hour together. He managed to tease her out of eighty dollars at the rate of twenty dollars per hour. They continued to see each other afterward, free of charge. Grimble seduced a nineteen-year-old girl who came to his door selling magazines. Despite the fact that he was wearing boxers and a dirty sweater, he fucked her within an hour. And he didn't even buy a magazine. Page 236 220 After hearing about Maddash, Vision, and Grimble's latest antics, any PUA who had been disillusioned with the community after Mystery's breakdown was soon back in the game full throttle. And the most full throttle of them all was Papa. Papa's pledge to study for law school had lasted a month. Then he went on a road trip around the country, visiting all the PUAs he could. Every week he sent me his schedule: He was driving to Chicago on Wednesday to spend time with Orion and Maddash; then he was going to Michigan to meet Juggler; finally, he was spending the weekend in Toronto with Captain BL (a deaf PUA) and No. 9. The next week he was in Montreal hanging out with Cliff and David X. The week after, he was working his way down the California coast, from San Francisco to Los Angeles to San Diego. As for PUAs in other countries\u2014London, Tokyo, Amsterdam\u2014he was constantly talking to them on the phone or online. After a while, I couldn't tell whether he was still learning game or just trying to build his social circle. I don't think he knew either. He was simply imitating what he'd seen me do: travel around the world, meet different PUAs, and become the best. There was one fledgling PUA, in particular, whom Papa bonded with: a twenty-two-year-old Canadian who had discovered the pickup scene when his mother stumbled across a seduction website. He called himself Tyler Durden, after the seditious character in Fight Club. And like a virus or a dem\u00ad agogue (choose your simile), he would eventually change the course of the community and everyone in it. He was a philosophy student at Queens University in Kingston, On\u00ad tario. Beyond that, not much else was known about him\u2014or would ever be known about him. He claimed to have been one of the biggest drug dealers in Kingston. He claimed to come from a rich family. He claimed to have written rigorous philosophy papers for academic journals. He claimed to have been a bodybuilder. But no one really knew. Tyler hit the seduction boards like a hurricane. Before anyone had even met him, one thing was clear: He was obsessed to a degree beyond what any of us had seen before. He read the posting archives\u2014thousands of pages long\u2014of every master PUA in the game. And he was whipping through the list of recommended books\u2014from Introducing NLP to Mastering Your Hidden Self\u2014at a furious rate. He was a knowledge junkie. Within a couple of months, he had consumed nearly every piece of rel\u00ad Page 237 221 evant information on seduction and reinvented himself as a self-styled au\u00ad thority, delivering stream-of-consciousness essays and field reports full of impressive feats and braggadocio. Like thumbtacks to a magnet, the seduction boys were up his ass. He was a manic new voice, an instant do-it-yourself guru. And, soon, he was Papa's trusted wing. He joined Papa on his journey to spend face time with every seducer with a silly nickname. And one of them, naturally, was me. Tyler Durden e-mailed me constantly. He was a persistent little brat, as I suppose I had been. He seemed to pride himself on being a provocateur. For years, nervous AFCs who were new to the community were told to take the newbie mission. It involved simply showering, putting on nice clothes, going to the nearest shopping center, and smiling and saying \"hi\" to every woman who passed by. Many AFCs found that this not only helped them overcome their shyness, but that some women actually stopped to talk. Tyler",
  "104": "Durden advocated a new mission. He called it Project Mayhem, in honor of Fight Club. And the directive was to run up to an attractive woman and\u2014before even uttering a word\u2014lightly body check her, whack her on the head with something soft, or physically accost her in some other playful manner. On the seduction boards, the majority of people didn't think. They obeyed. I could have posted that snorting birth control pills helped my game, and they all would have been lining up outside Planned Parenthood. So after reading about Project Mayhem, hundreds of sargers around the world were suddenly knocking into women with grocery carts and smacking them with gym bags. It wasn't seduction, it was elementary-school recess. And therein lay his appeal: Tyler Durden made seduction seem playful and subversive\u2014unlike, say, Speed Seduction, which required homework, rote memorization, and even meditation exercises. Yet, at the same time, there was something off about Tyler Durden. Vi\u00ad sion had kicked him out of his house after finding him a snotty and un\u00ad grateful guest, constantly demanding to be shown new routines. And though Tyler's field reports were fun and compelling, every time he had the option of getting laid, he seemed to back down. Page 238 MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014Speed Closing AUTHOR Tyler Durden Okay, this just happened not even fifteen minutes ago, and I can't tell anyone other than you guys about it. I was pretty bored today, so I went to the Rideau Centre shopping mall in Ottawa, hoping to meet some new HBs to hang with tonight because my AFC friends were all with their girlfriends. I cruised the mall, and I couldn't find any HB higher than a 7.5, so I was pretty pissed. I was about to leave when I saw this new Booster Juice place with a cute little redhead working there\u2014about a 7.5 like every other damned Rideau Centre chick. I ordered a juice, and here's what happened: TD: Which mango is better: mango hurricane or mango breeze? HB: Mango hurricane. TD: Awesome. I'll have the breeze. HB: Ha ha, okay. Which booster do you want? TD: What are boosters? HB: Those things on the sign on the wall. TD: Ooh, so I can get like vitamins and energy and shit in it. Awesome! I'll be like a new man after I drink this. This is the shit! HB: Ha ha. TD: High-five! HB: Okay! (She high-fives me.) Wow! That was like the coolest thing that's happened to me all day. TD: Pretty bored, huh? HB: Yeah, it sucks here. TD: Hmm, well, guess what? HB: What? Page 239 223 TD: I love you. HB: Ha ha. Urn, okay. I love you too. TD: Awesome! We're going to get married. Wow, you can really find love in the strangest of places, like right here at the Booster Juice. HB: Ha ha. TD: Wait a sec. I know, close your eyes. HB: Why? TD: Just do it. HB: Are you gonna steal my cash register or something? TD: No, nothing like that. I swear. Remember, I love you. HB: Okay, (closes eyes) The counter was pretty wide. I leaned way over, so that I was Superman- style horizontal over the top, and kissed her. As soon as I kissed her, she started screaming like fucking crazy. HB: Aaaaaaaahhhh! Aaaaaaaahhhh! All these people started looking over at me. She was freaking out, screaming her head off like a banshee, flailing her arms around and shit. I was thinking, \"Fuck, fuck, fuck. I knew this shit would backfire someday. Fuck. I should have waited for more lOls or something. Fuck I thought I had the lOls! I'm never doing this ever again!\" TD: Urn, I said I loved you first. HB: Aaaaaaaahhhh! Aaaaaaaahhhh! TD: Urn, are you okay? HB: Aaaaaaaahhhh! TD: Uh-oh. HB: Urn, okay. That will be five dollars and thirty-one cents. Aaaaaaaahhhh! She was trying to regain her composure by talking, but she kept screaming intermittently. TD: Please calm down. HB: Urn, yeah. I'm okay. What's your name? TD: Please don't call the police on me. HB: No, no. It's just for the computer. I ask everyone. TD: Okay. It's Tyler. Page 240 224 HB: Wow, that's an awesome name. TD: Urn,",
  "105": "thanks. What's your name? HB: Lauren. TD: I like that. HB: Oh my God, that was the most awesome thing that's ever happened to me in my entire life! TD: Cool! HB: Oh my God, you rock. Oh my God, I love you! That was fucking awesome! TD: Glad to be of service. I promise I'll come back. I'll make you close your eyes again. HB: Will you do more next time? [winks, implying sex, I suppose) TD: I won't let you down. You know I love you. HB: I'm looking forward to it. TD: Wow, it looks so cool back there. Give me the backstage tour. HB: Okay, c'mon back. I was thinking, \"Holy shit, I can't believe this!\" I felt inside my jacket pockets, and I still had these two LifeStyles Tuxedo Black condoms that Orion had given me last weekend, so I could go for it if I wanted to. Then I totally chickened out. I was like, \"I can't handle this shit! I met this girl not even two minutes ago!\" There were literally fifty people all staring at me, watching the chick open the door for me to come back there with her. They were all looking like, \"What the fuck is going on?\" And it was making me really uncomfortable. With hindsight now, I would have done it. But at the time, I was so taken by surprise. So I said: TD: Urn, actually I'm in a major rush. HB: Will I see you again? TD: Well, I'm leaving town tomorrow. HB: Okay, what about after work? TD: Urn, I have to go hang out with my friends. I'll come back tomorrow and we'll go out then. HB: Okay. Oh my God, that rocked! Wow! Then I turned around and walked off. \u2014TD Page 241 Mystery was back. No. 9, his roommate, called and told me Mystery had been released from the hospital and was staying with his family. He was expecting him back at the apartment the following week, when Tyler Durden would be driving in to take a one-on-one workshop. It was probably too soon to be teaching again, but Mystery needed to pay the rent\u2014and Tyler was deter\u00ad mined to meet him. \"I came out of this strange emotional journey with some incredible cognitive models,\" Mystery told me a few days later. His voice was Anthony Robbins clear again, his mind lucid. Life ap\u00ad peared to matter once more. However, something seemed different. He was in manic mode\u2014more so than ever\u2014but it was a new type of manic mode. He hadn't exactly returned; he had transformed. \"I have my life goals set,\" he continued. \"The motivational carrots are all dangling properly in front of me. This year, I will build the foundation to take down Copperfield. I've decided to beat him. I am a superstar. My brain pupated into a butterfly.\" I asked him if he was on any medication. He said he wasn't. \"I've given it a great deal of thought,\" he went on. \"I only get depressed when I isolate myself. Look at what got me there: the pair-bond break with Patricia, new hotties staling and blurring,7 no career momentum, and being alone in the apartment with no one to talk to. So we need to design a social environment with people to motivate me\u2014something like Sweater's place in Australia. We can all motivate each other. While I was at the hospital, I took a lot of notes on this idea. I showed them to my psychiatrist. Even he was im\u00ad pressed. I'm calling it Project Hollywood.\" That moment was the first time I heard the phrase Project Hollywood. I didn't think much about it at the time. I figured it would end up like Pro\u00ad ject Bliss: another stillborn scheme consigned to the trashcan of mental masturbation. Staling and blurring occur when a woman stops returning phone calls. See glossary. Page 242 226 \"I shine,\" he went on. \"I see this now. I'm a superstar, just like I'm tall. I'm simply a superstar who's been holding himself back. And I'd like you to come be a star with me.\" It was good to have Mystery back. Flawed though he was, he had a cer\u00ad tain charm. Some would call it narcissism, and they wouldn't be wrong, but at least he saw greatness reflected not just in the mirror but also in the po\u00ad tential of those around him. That's what had made him such an influential teacher.",
  "106": "\"Dude, I'm already a star, at least in the community,\" I told him. \"While you were gone, I was voted number one pickup artist\u2014above even you. It's insane. A guy from England I've never even met before called the other day and said he pretends to be me when he's fucking girls. It makes him feel more powerful. What do you think of that?\" It was getting harder to live up to my name. One of our former stu\u00ad dents, Supastar, a ruggedly handsome teacher from South Carolina, had re\u00ad cently posted, \"When I die and go to pickup heaven, Style will be there waiting for me because he is a pickup god.\" Mystery laughed when he heard it. \"That's something you're going to have to come to grips with,\" he said. \"You've created an alter ego that you Page 243 Mystery wanted to book me for three months straight. He planned to schedule workshops in London, Amsterdam, Toronto, Montreal, Vancou\u00ad ver, Austin, Los Angeles, Boston, San Diego, and Rio. But I couldn't commit to the time. I needed to resuscitate my career. There was something I used to do before I was a full-time pickup artist\u2014or, as the kids now called me, an mPUA (master pickup artist). It was called writing. Somewhere, in another life, I used to wake up in the morning, sit at a desk before even eating or showering, and stew in my own filth as I sat typ\u00ad ing on a computer and not getting laid. Now that I was mastering this whole girl thing, I needed to put the other pieces of my life back in balance. All the sarging was starting to scramble my brain. I was becoming too dependent on female attention, al\u00ad lowing it to be my sole reason for leaving the house besides food. In the pro\u00ad cess of dehumanizing the opposite sex, I had also been dehumanizing myself. So I told Mystery that I was going to cut back on the whole sarging thing. I was currently seeing eight girls in L.A. My dance card was full. There was Nadia and Maya and Mika and Hea and Carrie and Hillary and Susanna and Jill. They had needs, and there were no strings attached. They knew I was seeing other women. And they were probably seeing other guys. I didn't know, didn't care, and didn't ask. All that mattered was that when I called them, they came. And when they called me, I came. Everybody came. What I didn't tell Mystery was that I didn't trust him anymore. I wasn't going to set aside time and buy plane tickets only to have him break down on me again. I wasn't a babysitter. Trust, I always told women, is something you must earn. And he would have to earn my trust again. It didn't take Mystery long to find two willing and enthusiastic wings to replace me: Tyler Durden and Papa. I wasn't surprised. Since Mystery had gotten out of the hospital, the pair was constantly in Toronto, staying at his apartment and vacuuming every shred of pickup information from his brain. Page 244 228 Mystery would call every day to fill me in on their progress. He'd say, \"I've humbled Tyler Durden with my game. He was an asshole at first, but we've broken through that and he's allowed himself to be taken under my wing as a proper student.\" He'd say, \"I've finally figured out the formula for getting rapport with a woman. Are you ready?\" Big pause. \"Rapport equals trust plus comfort!\" He'd say, \"When you meet Tyler Durden, don't expect to like him. Only expect to tolerate him. He makes rationalizations constantly.\" \"Then why do you hang out with him?\" \"He'll call and say he's coming for the weekend, and I just let him. He's like a thorn in my side that gets me out of the house.\" \"So should I let him stay at my place when he comes to town with Papa?\" \"He's part of the PUA family. Just think of him as the annoying cousin who farts a lot.\" One week later, Papa and Tyler Durden were on my doorstep. Papa actually looked somewhat cool. He wore a leather jacket, sun\u00ad glasses pushed up on his forehead, and an expensive cotton dress shirt un\u00ad tucked over jeans. Behind him was the palest non-albino human being I had ever seen. A shock of orangey blond stuck",

His head was cocked upward; his smile seemed like a plastic snap-on attachment, and his features were flattened as if pressed back by an invisible stocking. Though he claimed online to be an avid weight-lifter, his body and face were doughy. Technically, he was a small person. He just had a certain genetic softness. This was Tyler Durden. He reminded me of Heat Miser from The Year Without A Santa Claus. He nodded at me when he walked in. No word of greeting\u2014and, a pet peeve, no eye contact. I don't trust people who don't look me in the eye when they meet me. But I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he was nervous about making a good first impression. In his writings, he con\u00ad stantly referenced my posts and techniques. He looked up to me. They all did. But most were humble about it. Tyler Durden reacted to being uncom\u00ad fortable by acting aloof and arrogant. Fine. Bono from U2 does that too. That's their thing. When we went out to dinner, Tyler opened up. In fact, he talked non\u00ad stop, without even pausing between sentences. It was difficult to get a word in edgewise. He liked to talk in circles around a point rather than getting di- Page 245 229 rectly to it. He was the victim of a disease called thinking too much. My head spun listening to him. \"I was busting on this girl Michelle,\" he was saying. \"I was busting on her hard. Hard fucking busting, dude.\" And here he pulled his head back, pursed his mouth, raised his eyebrows, and started nodding. The gesture was meant to convey how hard the busting was, but it looked strange and artificial. \"Then this dude comes up to her and is like, 'Michelle, you are so cute. You are the bomb.' And she looks at me and goes\"\u2014here he smirked and spoke in a whiny falsetto to imitate her\u2014\" 'I hate it when guys do that. Now I will never ever like him. I only want a guy who doesn't want me. I hate guys who want me. I hate it.'\" After an hour of blather, I started to understand Tyler Durden. Human interaction to him was a program. Behavior was determined by frames and congruence and state and validation and other big-chunk psychological principles. And he wanted to be the Wizard of Oz: the little guy behind the curtain, pulling the strings that made everyone around him think he was a big and powerful master of the realm. I got it. I liked getting it. Now here's the context: He grew up physically small and mentally slow for his age, he said. His father, a football coach, imposed high standards on him that he could never meet. This was all thet biographical detail I was able to gather. It felt like a lot of hard information coming from him. And I still didn't know if it was truthful. Every time the waitress came to the table, Tyler Durden wanted me to demonstrate a routine on her. \"Do the jealous girlfriend opener,\" he'd say. \"Show me an IVD,\"8 he'd say. \"Do Style's EV,\"9 he'd say. I thought about how Tyler Durden had constantly pestered Vision for routines and material. Now I understood why Vision had kicked him out of the house. He didn't seem to see the humanity in us. He didn't care about what we did for work; where we were from; or what our thoughts on cul\u00ad ture, politics, and the world were. There was a distinction he didn't seem to understand: We weren't just PUAs. We were people. 8 An acronym for interactive value demonstration. See glossary. 9 An acronym for eliciting values. See glossary. Page 246 After dinner, I had a special evening planned for Tyler Durden and Papa. Hillary, the blue-haired burlesque dancer I'd battled Heidi Fleiss and Andy Dick for, was performing at the Spider Club in Hollywood. So I called a few other women to join us there, including Laurie, the Irish girl who had in\u00ad spired me to invent the evolution phase-shift routine. I figured Tyler would want to meet Grimble, so I invited him as well. When we arrived, Laurie and her girlfriends were sitting at the bar. Nearly every male in the room was staring at them,",
  "108": "trying to work up the courage to approach. I introduced them to Tyler. After saying hello, he pro\u00ad ceeded to sit down and not speak another word. For ten minutes, he sat there in uncomfortable silence. It was the first time he had shut up all night. When I introduced them to Papa, he immediately came to life. He took the sunglasses off his head and put them on Laurie\u2014a move Mystery had taught him in Toronto when he asked how to keep the target from wander\u00ad ing off while being ignored. He then started running my value- demonstrating routine about C-shaped smiles versus U-shaped smiles. I liked watching Papa's progress. Arbiters of cool like to say that some people have it and other people don't. And you can tell in an instant, just from looking at someone, whether they have it. I'd thought my whole life that it was something one was born with. However, the whole community was predicated on the idea that it was something people could learn. Though there was still something mechanical about Papa, he was starting to get it. He was like an it robot. While Papa entertained the girls, Tyler Durden and I went to the other room to watch Hillary dance. She was in a birdcage, waving two massive feathered fans in front of her body. A glimpse of shoulder here. A glimpse of leg there. She had a spectacular body. Too bad I'd never sleep with her again. \"Why didn't you say anything to Laurie and her friends?\" I asked Tyler. \"I didn't know what routines you had used on them,\" he replied. \"I didn't want to repeat anything.\" Page 247 231 \"Dude, don't you have a personality of your own that you can use?\" Hillary was wearing just feathered pasties and matching panties now. She had such soft skin. Her nose looked like a beak, though. The last time I saw her, she told me she'd had a herpes outbreak. I couldn't bring myself to have sex with her. \"Let's go somewhere else?\" Tyler nudged me. \"Why? There are plenty of girls here.\" She had done the right thing by telling me she had herpes. It's better than keeping it a secret and letting me catch it. I couldn't punish her for honesty. But now I was too paranoid to sleep with her. \"I want to see you work in a place where you don't know anyone,\" Tyler prodded. She covered her body with a feather, reached under her legs, and threw her panties into the audience. A flying herpes rag. A hipster with mutton- chop sideburns caught it. He crumpled it in his fist and thrust it into the air excitedly. His little venereal prize. A hand clapped my shoulder. It was Grimble, in his lucky pickup shirt. \"So what's up, man?\" he asked \"Nothing much. How do you feel about accompanying Tyler Durden here to the Saddle Ranch?\" \"You're not coming?\" Tyler Durden asked. \"I really wanted to see your game.\" \"I'm tired, man.\" \"If you come, I'll do my Mystery-talking-about-how-much-he-misses- his-soul-mate-Style imitation for you. It's a real crowd pleaser.\" Thanks but no thanks. I walked to a booth and grabbed a seat opposite Hillary. \"Who are those losers you're with?\" she asked. \"They're pickup artists.\" \"Could have fooled me.\" \"Well, they're young. And they're still learning. Give them time.\" She pinched her left eyelash and slowly peeled it off. \"Want to go to El Carmen?\" she asked. Then her right eyelash. If I went, I'd have to sleep with her. That was part of the contract. \"No. I should really go home.\" I wanted to get myself tested for everything. I was too neurotic to be so promiscuous. Page 248 Despite everything, I wanted to like Tyler Durden. Everyone else seemed to. As he and Papa traveled the country winging workshops with Mystery, the reports of his skills were stellar. Perhaps he'd just been nervous around me. Or maybe he'd improved after being forced to perform for so many stu\u00ad dents, as I had. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. There were trends in the community. Ross Jeffries and Speed Seduction had ruled the seduction boards when I arrived over a year ago. Then Mys\u00ad tery Method took over, followed by",
  "109": "David DeAngelo and cocky funny. Now, Tyler Durden and Papa were on the rise. The funny thing was that although the methods kept changing, women weren't. The community was still so underground that few women, if any, knew what we were up to. These were trends that had nothing to do with females and everything to do with male ego. And one of the biggest egos of them all, Ross Jeffries, was getting left behind. Though Speed Seduction still had a lot to offer, it seemed as ar\u00ad chaic to the new generation of community members as buying a girl flowers and sharing a malt at the soda shop. And Ross wasn't happy about it. He wasn't happy about much. I found that out one night when I returned home to find the following message on my machine: Hey Style, it's Ross. I'm in a cranky mood. It's ten after twelve. Normally when I'm in a cranky mood, I call people I don't like and chew them out. But I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to tell you that it's uneven. It won't kill you to take me to more than one party, buddy, though I think you owe me a lot more than that. If you don't come through, I won't get mad. I'll just cut you out of the Speed Seduction community and everything else. I really will. So think about how my work has changed your life, and think about what you've given in return and what you've promised to give. It's just not fair. I'm hop\u00ad ing there's more to you than that. If it sounds like a challenge I'd issue to a girl, so be it. Page 249 233 I understood where Ross was coming from. I had been completely ig\u00ad noring him since our last party together. He'd have to hypnotize the image of him sniffing Carmen Electra's butt out of my head if I was ever going to take him to a party again. However, I called Ross a couple of nights later and invited him to din\u00ad ner for old-time's sake. He wasn't as angry as I thought he'd be, chiefly be\u00ad cause his mind was consumed by someone else: Tyler Durden. \"The guy gives me the willies,\" Ross said. \"There's something creepy about his lack of ordinary human warmth. I wouldn't be surprised if sooner or later he breaks from Mystery and just teaches totally on his own. He's un\u00ad comfortable around people who are more powerful than him. Besides, he's already claiming to be better than Mystery.\" Though I wrote the comment off as more of Ross's competitive para\u00ad noia, Tyler Durden soon proved him right. And it was my fault, according to Mystery. \"The workshops aren't fun anymore,\" Mystery complained. He was calling from New Jersey, where he was rained in with Tyler Durden and Papa at the home of a PUA named Garvelous, who invented toys for a liv\u00ad ing. \"They're just work. These things are only fun when you come with, be\u00ad cause then we get to wing each other.\" I was flattered, though workshops weren't supposed to be fun; as the name implied, they were work. \"Besides, my goals are changing,\" he continued. \"It started with want\u00ad ing attention. Now I think I'm looking for love. I want to be in a relation\u00ad ship where I can feel butterflies in my stomach. I want a woman I can respect for her art, like a singer or a super-hot stripper.\" The inevitable split came soon after. Mystery flew to England and Amsterdam with Tyler and Papa to teach another round of workshops. When he left with glowing reviews and nu\u00ad merous requests for an encore performance, Tyler Durden and Papa stayed behind to run a few workshops of their own to satisfy the demand. They were on break from college, and teaching men how to pick up women seemed a lot more appealing as an interim job than scooping ice cream or working at the local Baby Gap. Mystery phoned as soon as he returned to Toronto. \"My father has lung cancer, so he's on his way out,\" he said. \"It's strange, but the first per\u00ad son I wanted to call was you.\" Page 250 234 \"So how do you feel about it?\" \"I'm not upset, but my mom was crying and it's the first time I've ever seen her cry. Dad always wanted whiskey poured on his grave, so my brother said, 'I just hope he",
  "110": "doesn't mind me filtering it through my blad\u00ad der first.'\" Mystery laughed. I tried to force a chuckle out for his sake. But it didn't come. The image wasn't funny to anyone who didn't hate the guy. Meanwhile, Tyler Durden and Papa were running wild in Europe. At first, they pretty much taught Mystery's material. But that all changed one night in London, when they came into their own in the great outdoors of Leicester Square, ground zero for backpackers, clubbers, tourists, players, and drunks. It was here that AMOGing was born. The AMOG is the alpha male of the group, a constant thorn in the side of sargers. There's nothing more humiliating than having a lumbering high school quarterback who reeks of alcohol pick you up from behind and make fun of your peacocking gear in front of the girls you're trying to game. It's a constant reminder that you are not one of the popular kids, that you're just a closet nerd faking it. Tyler Durden may have been the biggest closet nerd of us all. But what he lacked in coolness and grace, he made up for in analysis. He was a social deconstructionist and behavioral micromanager. He could watch a human interaction and break it down to the physical, verbal, social, and psycholog\u00ad ical components that powered it. And AMOGing\u2014or cutting a competitive male cockblock out of a set\u2014appealed to his subversive side; stealing a woman from the jocks who used to pick on him in school was a taste far sweeter than simply seducing a woman sitting alone in a cafe. So he watched the body language AMOGs used to lower his status in sets; he observed the eye contact they used to signify to girls that he was a creep; he analyzed the way they'd pat him on the back with so much force that he'd lose his balance. Soon he was spending more time in the field studying AMOGs than sarging women, until he slowly and painstakingly laid out a new social order\u2014where, to paraphrase the musician Boyd Rice, the strong live off the weak and the clever live off the strong. Now nothing could stop the PUAs. They could steal girls right out from under the disbelieving eyes of boyfriends the size of refrigerators. They were stepping into dangerous territory. Page 251 MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: AMOG Tactics AUTHOR: Tyler Durden Here's some stuff I've been up to lately that is pretty funny. I learned most of this from European naturals while trying to steal sets from them and prevent them from stealing sets from me. The guys here are not pushovers lib most guys in North America. Many have game. So I've been figuring out how to out-game them. All of this has been field-tested probably hundreds of times. AMOG Hey girls, what's up? PUA Hey dude (put your hands in the air like you give up), I will pay you a hundred dollars right now to take these girls away from me. (The girls will go, \"No, no. We love you PUA.\" And they'll giggle and crawl on you, which is immediately deflating to the guy.) AMOG (Shows signs that he wants to fight) PUA Ha ha, dude. Are you like trying to pick a fight with me? Ha ha. Okay, okay. Hold up, hold up. Wait a sec. We'll do even better. First, we'll have an arm-wrestling competition. Then, we'll do one-armed push-ups. And last, pose-down! (Then start flexing and go, \"Ladies?\" They'll start saying how you're so strong. The AMOG will look like a tool because you're making him seem like he's trying too hard to impress the girls with his physical superiority.) AMOG Hey man, keep talking. Lets hear your pitch. Pick these girls up, man. You're doing awesome. PUA Hey, you know I've gotta try to impress you cool London guys (or Page 252 236 rugby-shirt-wearing guys or shiny-shoes guys or whatever). You guys fucking rock. (The point is to cut him down on whatever limited amount of knowledge you have of him, even if its not relevant. He'll feel uncomfortable and his body language will show it.) AMOG: Is that design on your shirt a sphincter? Man, you're going to need somebody to protect you, mate. You're going to",
  "111": "have all the guys into you. PUA: Dude, that's why I rolled up on you. I need you, man. Help me, please, man. I look at you, and I just know that you were born to protect my sphincter. (Somebody actually said this to me. And, to be honest, it was a good diss. So when you have an AMOG who knows the game, you have to go further. Put him in the position of trying too hard to be your friend or joke about hiring him to do jobs that are beta to you. Say, \"You're like a comedian, but you don't have to be funny for me to like you.\" Or, \"Man, that's great. You should like design my website or something.\") AMOG: [Starts touching you to show dominance) PUA: Ha ha, dude. I'm not into guys, man. Dude, the gay club is over there. Hands off the merchandise, buddy. (The girls laugh at him, then he starts qualifying himself to you that he's not gay.) AMOG: (Gets in your face) PUA: (Silence) (Don't respond. Just stand there quietly. If he keeps trying to out-alpha you and you don't answer, eventually he looks beta because he is trying too hard to get your attention. Another trick is to make let's-get-out-of-here motions with your eyes to the girls\u2014mimic what they do to each other when you're running a bad set\u2014and they'll leave with you.) Here are some other pointers. Page 253 237 If an AMOG is with the girls I'm sarging, the goal is to neutralize him. If he's just met the girls, the goal is to blow him out. AMOGing works best with the right body language. When you say these lines, you want to have a big smile on your face. If you can, elbow him hard in the chest or slap him on the back hard enough to make him spit up his drink. All this has to be under the guise of being friendly. And then (and this happened to me) tell him, \"Fair play, mate,\" and offer him your hand. When he reaches to shake your hand, pull away at the last minute. Tool him con\u00ad stantly. Also, you can use an AMOG's work for yourself. He lines 'em up, you knock 'em down. This is something I do a lot. I let a guy pick a girl up and increase her buying temperature, then I go in and out-alpha him. I say he's creepy to the girls, and then remove them from him. The girls are already aroused, so they are still in state based on what the AMOG did. I can do this on maybe 90 percent of sets I approach where a natural AMOG is talking to a girl. Have fun. \u2014TD Page 254 When the reviews of Tyler Durden and Papa's London workshops hit Cliff's List, Mystery was outraged. He wasn't upset about AMOGing. You had to give the pair credit for that. He was upset because Tyler Durden and Papa had set up their own website and rival company. Mystery had called his classroom seminars Social Dynamics. They called their in-field work\u00ad shops Real Social Dynamics. Papa was as robotic about setting up his seduction business as he had been about sarging. He copied Mystery's model to the letter. Mystery charged six hundred dollars. So did Tyler and Papa. Mystery scheduled his workshops for three nights. So did Tyler and Papa. Mystery started his les\u00ad sons at 8:30 P.M. and ended them at 2:30 A.M. So did Tyler and Papa. Though Tyler Durden and Papa said Mystery gave them permission to run their own workshops, Mystery claimed they used his client list and never asked him. When they exhausted that, they went around and spoke to the Speed Seduction lairs, drumming up business from Ross Jeffries's disci\u00ad ples. And when Ross began to smell a rat, they started their own lair in each region, beginning with P-L-A-Y (for Player's Los Angeles Yahoo group) in Southern California. Where Mystery limited his workshops to six people, Papa and Tyler Durden packed in dozens. It was sarging anarchy, but they were rolling in money. At nearly every workshop, Papa handpicked a student\u2014even if he happened to be a virgin\u2014and made him a guest instructor at the next workshop. Soon, Papa had his own gang of wings\u2014Jlaix, a San Francisco karaoke champ; Sickboy, a square-jawed New Yorker in the fashion indus\u00ad try; Dreamweaver, a University",
  "112": "of California senior and former Mystery student; and even Extramask\u2014that he was flying around to each work\u00ad shop. Despite all this, Mystery continued to let Tyler and Papa stay at his house and pick his brain whenever they were in Toronto. When I asked him why, he answered, \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" With a wonderful cliche like that, I assumed he knew what he was doing. Page 255 239 In the meantime, after seeing Tyler and Papa's success, two things dawned on the rest of the community. The first was that anybody could run a workshop. It didn't take any special talent to point two girls out to a guy and say, \"Go approach them.\" The second was that the demand for seduc\u00ad tion schooling was elastic. Guys would throw any amount of money at the problem to solve it. Mystery had made a crucial mistake: He didn't give his students non\u00ad disclosure agreements. And now the genie was out of the bottle. One by one, everyone woke up to the notion that all those hours they had spent studying and practicing seduction\u2014more time than they spent with family, school, work, and real-life friends\u2014had more applications than just keeping the prophylactic industry healthy. We were the creators and beneficiaries of a body of knowledge that was light years beyond the rest of the mating world. We had developed an entirely new paradigm of sexual relations\u2014one that gave men the upper hand, or at least the illusion of having the upper hand. There was a market for this. Orion, the spazz who had made the Magical Connections videos, started leading daytime workshops in shopping malls and on campuses. Next, two PUAs named Harmless and Schematic began advertising their own workshops, which was a surprise to everyone considering that Schematic had only lost his virginity a month beforehand. One of the Croatians I had met, Badboy, a charismatic PUA who limped and had only partial use of his left arm after getting hit by sniper fire during the war, started a company called Playboy Lifestyle. Students flew to visit him in Zagreb for training in how to become an alpha male. Ex\u00ad ercises included punching Badboy in the stomach and yelling, \"Fuck you, Badboy!\" as loud as they could. The average monthly salary in Croatia was $400; his workshops cost $850 per student. Wilder and Sensei, both Mystery Method graduates, led Pickup 101 workshops out of San Francisco. A mysterious website appeared offering a book called Neg Hits Explained. Vision quit his job to run one-on-one work\u00ad shops. One of Sweater's employees put together a seduction website and line of products. Three college students in London\u2014Angel, Ryobi, and Lockstock\u2014started teaching workshops called Impact Interaction. And even Prizer, the border-crossing hooker-fucker, put out a rambling DVD course, Seduction Made Easy, that doubled as unintentional comedy. Finally, Grimble and Twotimer jumped into the fray, each developing Page 256 his own method of seduction and writing an e-book on it. Grimble made fifteen thousand dollars the week his was released; Twotimer took in six thousand. The community was blossoming with enterprise. I realized that it was time for me to move. This was getting too big. The lid was going to blow. I'd been in the community for a year and a half since taking Mystery's first workshop. It was time to stake a claim on the seduction subculture be\u00ad fore another writer beat me to it. It was time to reveal myself. It was time to remind myself that I wasn't just a PUA; I was a writer. I had a career. So I called an editor I knew at the Style section of the New York Times. It seemed like an appropriately named section to write for. No one ever posted their real names online; we called each other by our nicknames. Even Ross Jeffries and David DeAngelo were pseudonyms. Our real-world jobs and identities were unimportant. Thus, everyone in the community knew me as Style. Few, if anyone, knew my real name or that I wrote for the Times. It wasn't easy to get the story into the",
  "113": "newspaper. It took two months of going back and forth with editors, writing draft after draft. They wanted more skepticism. They wanted proof of the powers of the various gurus. They wanted the inherent weirdness of the techniques to be acknowledged. They seemed to have trouble believing that these people\u2014and this world\u2014 really existed. Page 257 The night before the story on my double life as a pickup artist was pub\u00ad lished, I slept fitfully. I had created this character Style; now, in two thou\u00ad sand words of newsprint, I was going to kill him. I was sure everyone in the community would be pissed off that there had been a traitor in their midst. I had nightmares of sargers gathering outside my house with torches to burn me alive. But no amount of fretting and worrying could have prepared me for the response: There was none. Sure, there was a little bit of bellyaching about the community being exposed and potentially ruined. A few people didn't like the tone of the story, and Mystery resented being called a pickup artist rather than a \"Venusian artist,\" his latest neologism. But Style's credibility was safe: He had become so entrenched in the community that to the sargers of the world, he was a pickup artist first and a journalist second. Instead of being upset at Neil Strauss for infiltrating their community, they were proud of Style for getting an article in the New York Times. I was flabbergasted. I hadn't killed Style at all. I'd only made him stronger. Sargers Googled my name and ordered my books on Amazon, writing long posts detailing my career. When I asked them to keep my real- world and my online identities separate\u2014especially since I didn't want women I met looking up field reports I'd written about them\u2014they actually agreed. I was still in charge. Even more surprising, I didn't want to leave the subculture. I was a mentor now to these kids, and I had a role to fill. I had friendships to main\u00ad tain. Though I'd more than attained my goal as a pickup artist, along the way I had accidentally found the sense of camaraderie and belonging that had eluded me my whole life. Like it or not, I was an integral part of the community now. The kids were right not to feel shocked or betrayed. I was one of them. As for the women in my life, the article also had little effect. I'd already told them about the community and my involvement in it. And, in doing Page 258 242 so, I'd discovered a curious phenomenon: If I told a woman that I was a pickup artist before sleeping with her, she'd still have sex with me, but she'd make me wait a week or two longer just to ensure that she was different from all the other girls. If I told a girl I was a pickup artist after sleeping with her, she was usually amused and intrigued by the whole idea, and con\u00ad vinced that I hadn't been running game on her. However, her tolerance for the community lasted only until we broke up or stopped seeing each other, at which point it was used against me. The problem with being a pickup artist is that there are concepts like sincerity, genuineness, trust, and con\u00ad nection that are important to women. And all the techniques that are so ef\u00ad fective in beginning a relationship violate every principle necessary to maintaining one. Shortly after the article came out, I received a phone call from Will Dana, the features editor at Rolling Stone. \"We're doing a cover story on Tom Cruise,\" he told me. \"That's great,\" I said. \"Yeah. He wants you to do it.\" \"Would you mind specifying the pronoun? Who do you mean by be?\" \"Tom Cruise asked for you specifically.\" \"Why? I've never interviewed an actor before.\" \"He read that article you wrote in the Times on the pickup guys. You can ask him about it when you see him. He's in Europe right now scouting for locations for the next Mission: Impossible. But he wants to go to wheelie school with you when he gets back.\" \"What's wheelie school?\" \"It's where you learn to do motorcycle wheelies.\" \"Sounds cool. I'm in.\" I neglected to tell",
  "114": "Will that I'd never ridden a motorcycle in my life. However, it was high on the list of seduction-related skills I still wanted to learn\u2014just above improv classes and below self-defense. Page 259 STEP 7 EXTRACT TO A SEDUCTION LOCATION Page 260 AMONG OUR STRUCTURALLY CLOSEST ANALOGUES\u2014THE PRIMATES\u2014THE MALE DOES NOT FEED THE FEMALE. HEAVY WITH YOUNG, MAKING HER WAY LABORIOUSLY ALONG, SHE FENDS FOR HERSELF. HE MAY FIGHT TO PROTECT HER OR TO POSSESS HER, BUT HE DOES NOT NURTURE HER. \u2014 MARGARET MEAD, Male and Female Page 261 He was the first person I'd met since joining the seduction community who didn't let me down. His name was Tom Cruise. \"This is going to be great, man,\" he greeted me when I met him at wheelie school. He smiled, complimented my adventurousness, and smashed a friendly elbow into my chest. It was the exact same AMOGing gesture that Tyler Durden had written about in London. He wore black bike leathers with a matching helmet tucked under his left arm and two days of stubble on his chin. \"I'm training to jump a trailer,\" he said. He pointed to a mobile home sitting just off the track. \"It'll be bigger than that one. But it's not that hard.\" He squinted at the vehicle for a moment, visualizing the feat. \"Well, the jumping's not that hard. It's the landing that's difficult.\" He cocked his right hand and slugged me in the shoulder. Tom Cruise was the perfect specimen. He was the AMOG that Tyler Durden and Mystery and everyone else in the seduction community had been trying to emulate. He had a natural ability to remain dominant, phys\u00ad ically and mentally, in any social situation without seeming to exert any ef\u00ad fort. And he was the living embodiment of all six of Mystery's five characteristics of an alpha male. Nearly everyone in the community had studied his films to learn body language and regularly used terminology from Top Gun in the field. There was so much I wanted to ask him. But first I needed to confirm something. \"So what made you pick me for this article?\" The dust lifted off the track and blew around us as we clutched our bike helmets under our arms. \"I dug your New York Times piece,\" he replied. \"You were writing about the dating guys.\" So it was true. He paused and his eyes narrowed to slits, indicating that he was speak\u00ad ing about a serious topic. His left eye closed a little more than the right one, Page 262 246 giving the appearance of deep intensity. \"Now is that guy you wrote about in your article really saying that the character in Magnolia is based on him? Is he saying that?\" He was talking about Ross Jeffries. One of Ross's claims to fame was that he was the inspiration for Frank T.J. Mackey in Paul Thomas Ander\u00ad son's film Magnolia. Mackey was the character Cruise played: an arrogant se\u00ad duction teacher with unresolved father issues who wears a headset during his seminars and orders his students to \"respect the cock.\" \"He shouldn't,\" Cruise continued. He swallowed a salt pill and chased it down with a long swig of bottled water. \"That's not okay. It's not true. Re\u00ad ally. That is an invention that PTA had.\" PTA is Paul Thomas Anderson. \"That guy is not Mackey at all. He is not Mackey.\" It seemed important for Cruise to establish this. \"I worked on creating that character with Paul Thomas Anderson for four months. And I didn't use that guy at all.\"10 Cruise sat me on his 1000 CC Triumph motorcycle and taught me how to start the engine and shift gears. Then he raced around the track, popping wheelies, while I wiped out going five miles an hour on his top-of-the-line bike. Afterward, he brought me into his trailer. The walls were covered with pictures of the children he and his ex-wife Nicole Kidman had adopted. \"Has this Jeffries guy turned his character more Mackey-ish since the movie?\" Cruise asked. \"He's arrogant and megalomaniacal like Mackey. But he's not as alpha male as Mackey.\" \"I'll tell you something,\" Cruise said as he sat down at a table spread with finger sandwiches and cold cuts.",
  "115": "\"When I did that monolog as Mackey, we didn't tell the audience anything about what we were doing. And the guys just started getting pumped up as I was talking. So at the end of the day, PTA and I had to get on stage and say, 'Look, man. We just want to tell you that where this character is going and what he's saying is not good. And it's not okay.'\" Here came the lecture. First Dustin; now Tom Cruise. I couldn't under\u00ad stand it. What was wrong with learning how to meet women? That's what we're here for. It's how the species survives. All I wanted was an evolution- When asked how he had come up with the character of T.J. Mackey in an interview in Creative Screenwriting in 2000, however, Paul Thomas Anderson did mention researching Ross Jeffries. Page 263 247 ary edge. So why not work at it and learn to do it well, like I'd done with everything else in my life? Who says you're allowed to take lessons in mo\u00ad torcycle riding but not in interacting with women? I just needed someone to show me how to start the engine and shift to higher gears. And I wasn't hurting anyone. No one was complaining after I slept with them, no one was being lied to, no one was being hurt. They wanted to be seduced. Every\u00ad one wants to be seduced. It makes us feel wanted. \"We made this whole speech, because the guys were taking what we were saying and going with it and getting into it. So PTA and I were saying, 'Hey man, oh my God. Easy.'\" See, I wanted to tell him. Seduction is seductive. But I couldn't, because as he remembered that moment, Cruise let out a laugh. And Cruise doesn't laugh like ordinary people do. His laugh takes over a room. It comes on just fine, a regular laugh by any standards. You will be laughing too. But then, when the humor subsides, you will stop laughing. At this point, however, Cruise's laugh will just be crescendoing. And he will be making eye contact with you. Ha ha HA HA heh heh. And you will try to laugh again, to join him, because you know you're supposed to. But it doesn't come out right, be\u00ad cause it's not natural. He will squeeze out a couple words sometimes be\u00ad tween chuckles\u2014\"It's not real,\" in this case. And then he will stop, as suddenly as he started, and you will be relieved. \"Well,\" I told him, squeezing out the last breath of an awkward laugh. \"That's easy for you to say.\" We spent the next week together visiting various Scientology buildings. It's no secret that Tom Cruise is a member of the Church of Scientology\u2014a religion, self-help group, charity, cult, and philosophy started by the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. But Cruise had never taken a journalist into that world before. The more I learned about L. Ron Hubbard, the more I realized that he was the exact same personality type as Mystery and Ross Jeffries and Tyler Durden. They were wickedly smart megalomaniacs who knew how to syn\u00ad thesize great bodies of knowledge and experience into personality-driven brands, which they sold to people who didn't feel like they were getting what they needed out of life. They were obsessive students of the principles that guide human behavior. But the ethics of and motivation for their use of those principles made them controversial figures. On our last day together, Cruise took me on a tour of the Scientology Page 264 248 Celebrity Center in Hollywood, where I saw a classroom full of students be\u00ad ing trained to use e-meters, devices that measure skin conductance. When curious civilians come into the church, they are hooked up to e-meters and asked various questions. Afterward, the interviewer goes over the results with them and tells them why they need to join the Church of Scientology to fix their problems. Students were paired up in the classroom, role-playing the various sce\u00ad narios that can occur during an interview. They had large books spread out in front of them. Everything the interviewer (or auditor, in Scientology terms) utters\u2014every response to every contingency\u2014was contained in those",
  "116": "books. Nothing was left to chance. No possible convert was going to slip through their hands. What they were rehearsing, I realized, was a form of pickup. Without a rigid structure, rehearsed routines, and troubleshooting tactics, there would be no recruitment. One of my main frustrations with sarging was repeating the same lines over and over. I was getting tired asking girls if they thought spells worked or if they wanted to take the best friends test or if they noticed how their nose wiggled when they laughed. I just wanted to walk into a set and say, \"Love me. I'm Style!\" But after watching the auditors, I began to think that perhaps routines weren't training wheels after all; they were the bike.' Every form of dema- goguery depends on them. Religion is pickup. Politics is pickup. Life is pickup. Every day, we have our routines, which we rely on to make people like us or to get what we want or to make someone laugh or to endure another day without letting anyone know the nasty thoughts we're really thinking about them. After the tour, Cruise and I ate lunch in the Celebrity Center restau\u00ad rant. He was clean-shaven and ruddy-cheeked, wearing a dark-green crew- neck T-shirt that fit his body like a glove. Over a healthy slab of steak, he discussed his values. He believed in learning new things, doing the work re\u00ad quired of him, and competing with no one but himself. He was strong- willed, centered, and resolute. Any thinking that must be done, any turmoil that must be resolved, any issue that must be handled was solved first and foremost in a dialogue between Tom Cruise and himself. \"I don't really keep counsel with others,\" he said. \"I'm the kind of per- Page 265 249 son who will think about something, and if I know it's right I'm not going to ask anybody. I don't go, 'Boy, what do you think about this?' I've made every decision for myself\u2014in my career, in my life.\" Cruise leaned forward in his chair, resting his elbows in his lap. He was low in his seat and his head was parallel with the surface of the table. As he spoke, he expressed himself through gestures as subtle as changing the aperture of his eyes. The guy was born to sell things: movies, himself, Scien\u00ad tology, you. Whenever I criticized myself or made an excuse for myself, he jumped down my throat. \"I'm sorry,\" I said at one point, when discussing an article I'd written. \"I don't mean to sound like one of those writer guys.\" \"Why are you apologizing? Why not be a writer guy? Who are those guys? They're talented people who write about things that people are inter\u00ad ested in.\" Then he continued, mockingly, \"No, you don't want to be one of those guys who's creative and expressive.\" He was right. I had thought I was done with gurus, but I needed one more. Tom Cruise was teaching me more about inner game than Mystery, Ross Jeffries, Steve P., or my father ever had. He stood up and slammed his fist down on the table, hard\u2014AMOG- style. \"Why don't you want to be one of those guys? Be one of those guys, man. I mean it. That's cool.\" Okay. Cruise says it's cool. Case closed. As we talked, I realized that out of all the people I'd met in my lifetime, no one had their head screwed on more tightly than Tom Cruise. And this was a disturbing thought, because nearly every idea Tom Cruise expressed could be found somewhere in the massive writings of L. Ron Hubbard. I discovered this when Cruise had his personal Scientology liaison bring a heavy red book to the table. He opened it to the Scientology code of honor, and we discussed it point by point\u2014set a good example, fulfill your obligations, never need praise or approval or sympathy, don't compromise your own reality. When Cruise promised to send me an invitation for the center's annual Scientology Gala, I began to worry that this wasn't about an article for Rolling Stone at all. It was about getting another convert to Scientology. If that was true, he'd picked the wrong person. At most, he was introducing me to a body of",
  "117": "knowledge I could draw from, like the writings of Joseph Campbell or the teaching of the Buddha or the lyrics of Jay-Z. Page 266 250 After our meal and study session, Cruise invited me to the president's room to meet his mother, who was taking a course in the building. \"Let me ask you something else about that article you wrote,\" he said as we walked. \"A lot of that stuff is about trying to control people and manipulate situa\u00ad tions. Can you imagine all the effort they're putting into that? If they took that effort and put it toward something constructive, who knows what they could accomplish.\" The interview ended. The article was published. And Tom Cruise and I would meet again. I would be a different person then, but he would be the same. He would never change. He was an AMOG\u2014and he had AMOGed me. However, he hadn't converted me. He had his church. I had mine. Page 267 My church, however, still needed to be built. Tom Cruise was right: all our effort did need to be put toward some\u00ad thing constructive, something bigger than ourselves. I had felt after writing the Times article that my work was not done in the community, that it was all leading somewhere. Now I knew where: Project Hollywood, our church of the spread legs. The epiphany came to me on my birthday. Some of the PUAs threw a party for me at a Hollywood club called Highlands. They called nearly everyone I knew and had met in the last year. About three hundred guests came, along with another two hundred who showed up at the club just be\u00ad cause it was a Saturday night. Even the big boys from the community were there: Rick H., Ross Jeffries, Steve P., Grimble, Bart Baggett (who specializes in handwriting analysis), Vision, and Arte (who stars in his own line of sex\u00ad ual technique videos). Despite such heavy-hitters working the room, I had zero competition because, for the night, I was the man at the club. I was dressed like a dandy, in a long black jacket with a single button at the top and a cream shirt with ruffled sleeves exposed at my wrists. And I was surrounded by women: fuck buddies, friends, strangers. I couldn't carry on a conversation for more than two minutes because people were constantly pulling me away to talk. I didn't have time to spit game. Women complimented me on my looks, my body, even my ass. Four different girls handed me their phone numbers over the course of the night. One said she had to meet her boyfriend, but then wanted to escape and party with me; the other gave me not just her phone number, but also her address and apartment number. These were girls I didn't know before the party, and two weren't even there for my birthday. I didn't need routines, boyfriend destroyers, gimmicks, or wings. All I needed was a big pocket to hold all the scraps of paper. In addition, two porn stars a friend had brought with him introduced themselves. One was either named Devon or Deven; the other had big teeth. Page 268 We talked for a half hour, and they supplicated to me the whole time. The night felt like the time in Toronto when everyone though I was Moby\u2014 except this time they knew I was Style. Mystery had recently developed another theory of social interaction. It basically stated that women are constantly judging a man's value in order to determine if it can help them with their life objectives of survival and replication. In the microcosmic world we had created at the Highlands that night, I had the highest social value in the room. And just as most men are attracted in a Pavlovian manner to anything that is thin, has blonde hair, and possesses large breasts, women tend to respond to status and social proof. In the end, I took a petite, mischievous stripper with big saucer eyes named Johanna back to my house. While she was on my bed, grinding me through my clothes, she asked, \"What do you do for a living?\" \"What?\" I replied. I couldn't believe she would ask that, but she seemed to need that piece of information in order to explain my status at the",
  "118": "party and her attraction to me. \"What do you do?\" she asked again. And that's when I had the epiphany: Sarging is for losers. Somewhere along the line, sarging became seen as the goal of pickup. But the point of the game is not to get good at sarging. When you sarge, every night is a new one. You're not building anything but a skillset. What got me laid on my birthday was not sarging but lifestyle. And building a lifestyle is cumulative. Everything you do counts and brings you closer to your goal. The right lifestyle is something that is worn, not discussed. Money, fame, and looks, though helpful, are not required. It is, rather, something that screams: Ladies, abandon your boring, mundane, unfulfilled lives and step into my exciting world, full of interesting people, new experiences, good times, easy living, and dreams fulfilled. Sarging was for students, not players, of the game. It was time to take this brotherhood to the next level, time to pool our resources and design a lifestyle in which the women came to us. It was time for Project Hollywood. Page 269 Mystery flew into town to meet me. All he had needed was the word go. He was the only person I could talk to who wasn't afraid to take chances and make changes to pursue his dreams. Everyone else I knew al\u00ad ways said, \"Later\"; Mystery said, \"Now,\" and that was an intoxicating word to me\u2014because later, every time I'd ever heard it, translated as never. \"Now is the time, Style,\" he said when he arrived at my apartment in Santa Monica. \"Let's build this shit. Sarging is for losers. I mean, sure, it's better to be a loser who gets laid than one who doesn't, but we're talking about a championship level of game now.\" I knew he'd understand. According to the books I'd read on cold-reading, all human problems fall into one of three areas: health, wealth, and relationships, each of which has an inner and an outer component. For the past year and a half, we'd been focusing solely on relationships. Now it was time to get every cylinder in our lives firing. It was time to follow through on Mystery's codeine- addled ramblings and join forces to work together for more than just HB10s. We were greater than the sum of our cocks. The first step to making Project Hollywood a reality was to find a man\u00ad sion in the Hollywood Hills, preferably with guest bedrooms, a hot tub, and a location near the clubs on Sunset. Next we needed to hand-select the best in the community to live with us. Perhaps I shouldn't have trusted Mystery again. But this time, I wouldn't let myself be dependent on him. His name wasn't going to be on the lease. Neither would mine, for that matter. We'd find a third party to take the risk and the responsibility. We found that third party living in the Furama Hotel. His name was Papa. His grades had kept him out of law school, so instead he'd enrolled at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles to study business. The day he moved from Wisconsin to Los Angeles, he dropped his bags off in his hotel room near the airport and took a taxi to my apartment, where six foot five inch Mystery was sleeping on my five foot six couch. Page 270 254 \"The three most influential people in my life,\" Papa told us as he sat down on the couch at Mystery's feet, \"have been you two and my father.\" Papa's hair was now spiked and gelled, and he looked like he'd been working out. I left him to talk with Mystery in my living room while I ran downstairs to a Caribbean food stand to get dinner for everyone. When I returned, Papa was Mystery's manager. \"Are you sure you know what you're doing?\" I asked Mystery. I couldn't believe he was going to let a protege-turned-competitor manage him. Mys\u00ad tery was an innovator. If Ross Jeffries was the Elvis of seduction, Mystery was the Beatles. Tyler and Papa were merely the New York Dolls: They were brash, they were loud, and everyone thought they were gay. \"Papa likes the business and he can fill workshops every weekend,\" Mystery replied. \"So all I have to do is show",
  "119": "up.\" Papa, in his networking mania, was in constant contact with nearly every major sarger. He knew all the lair presidents and was on all the seduc\u00ad tion mailing lists. With just a few e-mails and phone calls, he could recruit a dozen students nearly anywhere in the world. \"It's win-win,\" Papa insisted. Ever since he'd gotten into the pickup business, that had become Papa's favorite phrase. He was smarter than I'd given him credit for. He was going to become the middle man for the biggest pickup artists in the community. And they were all going to let him, because most artists have the same fatal flaw: They're too lazy to deal with anything practical themselves. We never actually invited Papa to join us in Project Hollywood that day. It just happened because he was willing to do the work. There was a Cold- well Banker office across the street from the hotel, and Papa walked in and found us a real estate agent named Joe. Real estate agents don't make much money on rentals, but Papa managed to talk Joe into working for us by promising to teach him the game. \"He's going to take us tomorrow to look at houses,\" Papa said when we met him in the lobby of the Furama Hotel one afternoon. \"There are three places I really like. There's a mansion on Mulholland Drive; there's the for\u00ad mer Rat Pack crib off Sunset; and there's the supermansion, which has ten bedrooms, tennis courts, and a built-in nightclub.\" \"Well, I'm for the supermansion,\" I told him. \"How much is it?\" \"It's fifty thousand a month.\" \"Forget it.\" Page 271 255 Papa's face clouded. He didn't like the word no. He was an only child. He disappeared into his hotel room and emerged a half hour later with a sheet of paper in his hands. On it, he had sketched out a plan to earn $50,000 a month. We'd throw a weekly party in the club, and make $8,000 by charging admission and $5,000 in drinks per month; various pickup and lifestyle seminars would earn the house $20,000; we'd offer tennis lessons that would add up to $2,000 a month; and the ten residents of the house would pay $1,500 each in rent. It was completely impractical. It wasn't worth spending all our income on overhead. But it was impressive. Papa was going to make Project Holly\u00ad wood happen, no matter what it took. I began to understand why Mystery wanted to work with Papa. He was one of us: He was a go-getter. He had ini\u00ad tiative. And, unlike Mystery, he was a closer. As a pickup artist, Papa also seemed worthy of Project Hollywood. He'd proven his fearlessness in the field over and over since we'd met him in Toronto. And he would prove himself once more the following day, when he picked up Paris Hilton at a taco stand. Page 272 MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014The Seduction of Paris Hilton AUTHOR: Papa Today, I went with Style, Mystery, and our real estate agent to our prospective mansion, Dean Martin's old crib in the Hollywood Hills. I am in love with the place and can't wait to close the deal. We will be on top of the world, literally and figuratively. When you are in our crib, everything seems perfect. Its a short walk to a popular Mexican fast-food restaurant, so we went over there for a late lunch. After ordering food, we found a table outside. Suddenly, our agent leaned over to me and whispered: REAL ESTATE AGENT: You know, I saw Paris Hilton walk inside the restaurant. I think she's ordering a burrito. Why don't you go pick her up? PAPA: Really? STYLE: Hey, if you are going to walk over there, don't look in her direction. PAPA: All right, its playtime. I got up, walked into the restaurant, and saw a hot blonde chick getting salsa. So I thought, \"Salsa sounds good to me.\" I've been gearing my game up for this moment, and now it was time to take what I deserved. So I walked over to her side and pretended like I was just at the salsa bar by coincidence. I helped myself to some salsa, and then looked over my right shoulder at her and started the conversation with Style's jealous girlfriend opener.",
  "120": "PAPA: Hey, I need a female opinion on something? PARIS: (Smiles and looks up) Okay. PAPA: Would you date a guy who was still friends with his ex-girlfriend? PARIS: Yeah. I think so. Sure. I started to walk away, then turned back and continued the conversation. Page 273 257 PAPA: Hmm. Actually, this is a two-part question. PARIS: (Smiles and giggles) PAPA: Imagine you were dating a guy who was still friends with his ex-girlfriend. And you were going to move in with him but he had a drawer with pictures of his ex-girlfriend\u2014not nudie pictures or anything, just regular pictures and some letters. PARIS: Ooh. I would so get rid of them. I would put them in a box. I cut her off and continued with the opener. PAPA: Do you think its unreasonable for her to want him to get rid of those pictures? PARIS: Oh, for sure. I dated a guy who did that, and I tossed them. PAPA: Wow! The reason why I asked was because I have a friend in the same situation, and she burned them. PARIS: Yes. That's what I should have done. [Smiles] PAPA: Hmm. Cool. Paris finished getting her salsa, then took her salsa containers and started to walk away. PAPA: Hey, you know, you look like a little cartoon version of Britney Spears. Oh, maybe its just your teeth. Paris put her salsa container back on the table, looked at me, and smiled. Then I told her Style's Cs versus Us routine. PAPA: Yeah! You have Britney teeth. Well, that's what my ex-girlfriend said. I mean, she has a theory that girls who have teeth in a wide C-shape, like Britney Spears, are perceived as good girls, no matter how many guys they hook up with. You have the same kind of C-shaped teeth. PARIS: (Excited and smiling) Oh, yeah? PAPA: Hey, I mean, just look at the smiles of the cover girls on magazines. They have the same kind of teeth. Well, at least that's what she said. She even got surgery done to her teeth because she had U-shaped teeth, like Christina Aguilera. She said U-shaped teeth are perceived as unfriendly, and that's why Christina Aguilera has the bad girl reputation and Britney Spears doesn't. Page 274 PARIS: [Smiles) Wow. We walked to the counter and she grabbed her food. I acted as if I were going to leave, but don't think I'm going to leave Paris without proper game. She had her food and was about to exit the restaurant, so I had to keep her there. I looked over my shoulder and continued the conversation. PAPA I have an intuition about you. PARIS: What? She put her food down and looked at me. PAPA: You know, I can tell you deep insights about yourself just by asking three questions. PARIS: Oh yeah? PAPA: Yeah. Here, come over to this table. PARIS: Okay, sure. I sat down at a nearby table, and she placed her food on the table and sat across from me. When she sat down, she smiled. I knew I was set and that it was time to work solid game. For the next fifteen minutes, we shared some sto\u00ad ries about Hollywood and talked about commonalities. I did some qualifying, gave her some Speed Seduction patterns, and told her some socially proofed higher-value stories. PAPA: Well, my friend taught me this fascinating visualization technique called the Cube. He's over there right now, and we just finished shopping for a house over there [pointing in the direction of the Holly\u00ad wood Hills). I've been living in a hotel for the last ten weeks. Ugh. PARIS: Oh yeah! Which one? PAPA: The Furama. PARIS: [Nods] Yeah, I live right up the street on Kings Road. PAPA: Cool. I'll be your neighbor. I'm moving into a house on Londonderry. It's a great place, and I already have so much heart for it. My friend Style and I are talking about making it a place for after-parties. PARIS: Cooool. PAPA: Okay. Are you ready for the Cube? Page 275 259 PARIS: Yes. Sure. [Smiles) PAPA [Escalating the yes-ladder) Before I start, I need to ask you a few questions. Are you intelligent? PARS: Yes. PAPA Are you intuitive? PARIS: Yes. PAPA Do you have a good imagination? PARIS: Yes. PAPA: Okay. Great! We'll continue then. Imagine",
  "121": "you're driving in the desert and you see a cube. How big is the cube? PARIS: Its really big! PAPA: How big is that? PARIS: As big as a hotel. Though I knew who she was, I didn't give it away and acknowledge she was a Hilton. PAPA: Hmm. Interesting. Okay, so what color is it? PARIS: Pink. PAPA: Cool. Is if something you can see through or is it solid? PARIS: You can see right through it. PAPA: Rock on! Now, lets add a ladder. Where is the ladder in relation to the cube? PARIS: Its leaning against the cube, going into the middle of it. PAPA: Ah! I would have expected you to say that. PARIS: Yeah. (Smiles and giggles) PAPA: Yeah. So let's add one more thing to your picture. Lets add a horse. Where is the horse in relation to everything in your picture? PARIS: Its sleeping. PAPA: Where is it sleeping? PARIS: In front of the cube. PAPA: Wow. Interesting. (Pause) Okay. Are you ready to find out what all of this mean? (Pause) It doesn't mean anything! No, just kidding. The cube represents what you think of yourself. Its your ego. Now, your cube is pretty big. You have a lot of self-confidence. Its not super- huge. I mean, it's not like you have a huge ego, but you definitely carry yourself with a lot of confidence. Also, your cube is pink. Page 276 260 PARIS: Yeah. That's my favorite color. PAPA: Well, pink is also a color that is playful and bright, and you chose that because you carry yourself with the same kind of energy. You are the kind of person who really likes to have fun and party, but you are also the kind of person who just enjoys being in other people's company. PARIS: Yes. PAPA: And your cube is something that you can see right through. Now, that represents how people interact with you because you are the kind of person who even when people first meet you, they can see right through you. You really connect with people and that rocks. PARIS: What's your name? PAPA: Papa. What's your name? PARIS: Paris. PAPA: Rock on. I feel like we have so much to talk about. PARIS: Yes. PAPA: We should definitely party it up together sometime. PARIS: Yes. We should. PAPA: Here. I gave her a piece of paper and a pen. She wrote down her first and last name, and then handed it to me, expecting to impress me and get a wow response. But I didn't give her any response, as if I had no idea who she was. Then I handed it back to her. PAPA: Here. PARIS: Okay. Write it down right here? PAPA: Yes. PARIS: This is my cell phone. PAPA: Cool. PARIS: Yeah. We should definitely meet up. PAPA: Yeah. Rock on. I'll see ya, kid. I walked back to see the boys at the table outside. STYLE: Nice job, man. Nobody give Papa a high-five or acknowledge it, in case she sees it. Well done, bro. Page 277 261 REAL ESTATE AGENT: High five, bro. I explained to the boys what happened. This rocks. I know that this is the way things are going to be. It just makes sense that I would roll with Paris Hilton when I am in Project Hollywood. Mystery, this is my set. So hands off when Paris comes by the crib to see Papa. Cheers, Papa Page 278 Every word Papa told Paris Hilton had come from me: the jealous girlfriend opener, the C-shaped versus U-shaped-smiles routine. Even his delivery of the Cube was the exact same as what he'd recorded at his first workshop with Mystery and me, down to the way he said, \"Interesting\" and \"Cool.\" He was a great robot, and he had just outperformed his programmer. We walked back to the house to meet the owners and sign the paper\u00ad work. The former home of Dean Martin (and later the comedian Eddie Griffin), the Rat Pack crib was just above Mel's Diner on Sunset Boulevard. It was $36,000 cheaper per month than the supermansion, and it was walk\u00ad ing distance from the clubs on Sunset Boulevard. The living room looked like a ski lodge. There was a fireplace, a sunken dance floor, a thirty-foot-high ceiling, a massive wood-inlay wall mural, and a large bar in the corner. The space could easily hold a few hundred people for seminars and parties. There were",
  "122": "two bedrooms off the living room on the ground floor. Outside each of these rooms was a staircase leading up to another bedroom. And then there was a small maid's room off the kitchen. The crown jewel of the house was the multitiered backyard. On one level, there were two patios shaded by palm and lemon trees. On the second level, there was a large brick terrace with a peanut-shaped pool, a Jacuzzi, a dining area, and a working barbecue and refrigerator. Beyond it lay a land\u00ad scaped hill with a path winding up to a small, secluded deck at the top of the property. From there, we could see the glittering lights and ten-story movie billboards of Hollywood. The place was a chick magnet. There was no way we could fail here. Papa put his name down on the lease. This, in addition to paying the larger of the rents, earned him the right to the master bedroom, which came equipped with a raised platform intended for a bed, picture windows, and a fireplace. The bathroom was decked out with a glass-encased circular shower, two walk-in closets, and a whirlpool bathtub built for three. The possibilities were limitless. Papa had visions of renting the house for after-Grammy parties, movie premieres, and corporate events. He no Page 279 263 longer sarged girls when he went out; instead he sarged promoters and celebrities, trying to make connections for Project Hollywood after-parties. He even used Speed Seduction and NLP tactics to try and hypnotize people into investing in the house. In his spare time, he made bids for tanning beds, movie projectors, pool tables, and stripper poles on eBay. He wanted to make Project Hollywood a place Paris Hilton would want to come every weekend to party. There were still two bedrooms that needed to be filled, so we issued a call for roommates on Mystery's Lounge. The response was terrifying: Everybody wanted in. Page 281 STEP 8 PUMP BUYING Page 282 ALL THE GIRLS LINE UP HERE, ALL THE BOYS ON THE OTHER SIDE. I SEE YOUR RANKS ARE ADVANCING. I SEE MINE ARE LEFT BEHIND. \u2014 ANI DIFRANCO, \"The Story\" Page 283 The first night, we all sat in the Jacuzzi from midnight until the skin hung loosely from our bodies, gazing at the palm trees of our new place and the lights of the Hollywood clubs we would soon descend upon. Mystery sang the entire soundtrack of Jesus Christ Superstar to the night sky. Papa told us about his plan to use the house for A-list Hollywood parties. And Herbal served watermelon drinks from his blender. There were no girls, and we didn't need any to validate us. Tonight, it was just the boys. We had done it. Project Hollywood was not just a fantasy anymore. \"We'll make the house famous with our public exploits,\" Mystery pre\u00ad dicted as we all sat there with smiles plastered to our faces. \"People will drive by and say, 'This was the home of the Hollywood celebrities Style, Mystery, Papa, and Herbal. They built their careers here and had parties that were the envy of the world.'\" Herbal was our fourth roommate. He was a tall, pale, even-tempered twenty-two-year-old PUA from Austin who peacocked by painting his nails silver and wearing all-white clothing. Like the rest of us, he was a reformed geek. But he owned a house in Texas, a Mercedes Benz S600, a Rolex, an of\u00ad fice on Sunset Boulevard that he never went to, and a robot vacuum cleaner. They were impressive holdings for someone his age. He had earned them in some kind of shady casino operation, in which he hired others to gamble for him. In his spare time\u2014which was basically all his time\u2014he explored caves, recorded extremely catchy rap songs, and surfed the Internet for un\u00ad usual items to buy and then never use. Mystery insisted that everyone in the home have an identity\u2014so we had a magician, a writer, a gambler, and a businessman. It was a combination that would prove more dramatic than the most sensationalist reality show. A few days later, Papa moved a fifth roommate, Playboy, into the maid's room. Playboy was a party promoter from New York who",
  "123": "earned my admi\u00ad ration when he told me he'd worked for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. He was genetically good-looking\u2014tall and slender with thick black hair\u2014but he had a bad habit of wearing long artsy scarves and pants Page 284 258 pulled up to his belly button. He had quit his job to move in with us, so Papa hired him to work for Real Social Dynamics in exchange for rent. Then there was Xaneus. He lived in a tent in the backyard. Xaneus was a short, stocky, fresh-faced college soccer player from Col\u00ad orado who had begged to live in the house. He said he'd sleep anywhere and do anything. So Papa pitched a tent for him, asked him to pay for utilities and house cleaning, and brought him into the Real Social Dynamics fold as an intern. For the first two weeks, all we did was marvel at the house. We'd done it; we had beaten the system. We had the most desirable location in West Hol\u00ad lywood. And we had lucked out with our roommates. Herbal had already scheduled a Pickup Artist Summit\u2014the first annual\u2014to take place in our house in a month. At our initial house meeting, we established a structure for Project Hollywood, putting Papa in charge of social activities and Herbal in charge of finances. Then we laid down the rules: No unapproved house- guests for more than a month; anyone conducting a seminar in the living room has to give the house fund a ten percent kickback; and no sarging women another PUA has brought into the house. All these rules would soon be broken. I initially enjoyed living with roommates, leaving my introverted writer's world and being part of a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts. Every morning, I'd wake up and see Herbal and Mystery pitching quarters into an ice bucket in the middle of the living room or jumping off a stepladder into a pile of pillows. They were like two kids in search of a playground. \"I have a feeling that you and I are going to become great friends,\" Mys\u00ad tery told Herbal one morning. When Playboy threw our first house party, five hundred people showed up. We were setting a great example\u2014maybe not to the neighbors, but at least to the community. Within a month, we had franchised. A group of PUAs moved into Herbal's old house and christened it Pro\u00ad ject Austin. Some of our former students in San Francisco rented a five-bedroom house in Chinatown and held pickup seminars in their living room, giving birth to Project San Francisco. Several college students in Perth, Australia, found a house together and Page 285 269 started Project Perth, approaching one hundred women in their first three days on campus. And four PUAs Mystery and I had trained in Sydney rented a beach apartment with an elevator that opened directly into a club below them. This was Project Sydney. Nobody had understood the potential of this whole pickup commu\u00ad nity, the bonding power of dudes talking about chicks. We had manicures, we had mansions, and we had game. We were ready to infect the world like a disease. Page 286 In my first month at Project Hollywood, entirely by accident, my sexual re\u00ad ality burst open. Just as Mystery's first workshop had opened my eyes to what was possible in a bar, this latest turn of events opened my eyes to what was possible in bed. And it all happened because Herbal wouldn't let me sleep\u2014for a week straight. \"Have you ever heard of a sleep diet?\" Herbal asked as we sat at Mel's Diner one morning. \"I discovered it on the Internet.\" In his free time, Herbal discovered a lot of things on the Internet: a lim\u00ad ousine on eBay he wanted to get for the house, dirt-cheap 1,000-thread- count sheets for our beds, a new and better way to fold shirts, and a business that sold penguins as pets (though when he ordered a penguin for the house, he learned that it was a joke website). \"Basically,\" he continued, \"it's a way to train your body to survive on just two hours of sleep a day.\" \"How is that?\" \"They did scientific research, and instead of sleeping for eight hours every night, what you",
  "124": "do is nap for twenty minutes every four hours.\" I was tempted. Having six extra hours in the day would give me time to write more, play more, read more, exercise more, go out more, and learn all the other PUA skills I never had time to. \"Is there a catch?\" \"Well,\" Herbal said. \"It takes about ten days to adjust to the schedule. And it's not easy. But once you make it over the hump, the naps become to\u00ad tally natural. People say they have more energy, though they also find them\u00ad selves wanting to drink a lot of juice for some reason.\" Just like when Marko suggested driving to Moldova, I didn't hesitate to say yes. I had nothing to lose if it didn't work, except ten days of sleep. We stocked up on video games and DVDs, and instructed our house\u00ad mates to help keep us disciplined. Oversleeping or missing even one nap would throw off the entire experiment, and we'd have to start over. As an ex\u00ad tra incentive to stay awake, I invited girls to the house each day. Page 287 271 I was seeing about ten different girls now. They were what the PUAs call MLTRs\u2014multiple long-term relationships. Unlike AFCs, I never lied to these girls. They all knew I was seeing other people. And, to my surprise, even if it didn't make all of them happy, none of them left me. One of the most important realizations I'd had in the game came from a Huna self- improvement book that Ross Jeffries had recommended, Mastering Your Hid\u00ad den Self. It taught me the idea that, \"The world is what you think it is.\" In other words, if you believe that you need to have a harem and having a harem is normal, women will agree to it. It's simply your reality. However, if you want a harem but secretly feel that it's cheating and unethical, you'll never have one. The only woman who wasn't entirely comfortable with this arrange\u00ad ment was a short, curvy, effervescent Spanish girl named Isabel, who had a habit of twitching her nose like a rat in search of cheese. \"I only sleep with one person at a time,\" she constantly told me. \"And I wish you'd do the same.\" On the fourth day of the sleep experiment, I invited Hea, the indie- rocker I'd met at Highlands, over to keep me awake. She was tiny, like a Chi\u00ad huahua, and wore large black spectacles. Yet there was something profoundly sexy about her, as if she were just one glass slipper away from becoming a princess. Potential for beauty is as attractive to most men as ac\u00ad tual beauty. When women go out with their hair, makeup, nails, and cloth\u00ad ing meticulously arranged, it's equally for the benefit of other women. Men, though they certainly enjoy it, don't require fashion-magazine grooming from a stranger: We have active imaginations. We are constantly stripping every woman naked as well as dressing her up to see if she meets our femi\u00ad nine ideal. Hea, then, was a girl who other women ignored yet every man de\u00ad sired. We saw her potential. When Hea arrived, Herbal and I greeted her at the door with bloodshot eyes, unshaven faces, and dragging feet. The sleep diet was taking its toll. Our manners and maturity were the first to go. We brought her into Herbal's room, sat her down on the floor, and played video games on the Xbox for an hour to keep ourselves awake. When the doorbell rang again, I trudged to answer it and found Isabel standing on the doorstep. \"I was dancing with some friends at Barfly,\" she said, nose a-wiggle. \"So since I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd drop by.\" \"You know I hate drop-bys.\" I had always told my MLTRs to call before Page 288 272 coming over, in case something like this happened. I sighed and let her in. It seemed rude to turn her away. \"But good to see you, I guess.\" I brought her into Herbal's room and introduced everyone. Isabel sat on the floor next to Hea. Her intuition tingled. She looked Hea up and down, then asked, \"So how do you know Style?\" I had a feeling this wasn't a casual visit but a sneak attack. So I left them alone in the room and went to find Mystery. I was too tired for drama.",
  "125": "\"Dude,\" I said. \"I'm screwed. Isabel and Hea are catfighting. How do I get rid of one of them?\" \"I've got a better idea,\" he said. \"You should threesome them.\" \"You're joking.\" \"No. One of my students was telling me about a technique he once used to get a threesome started. You should try it. Just suggest an innocent three-way massage. See what happens.\" \"Sounds like a gamble.\" I didn't want another disaster, like the Porce\u00ad lain TwinZ bathtub incident. \"You're not gambling. You're taking a risk. Gambling is completely ran\u00ad dom; a risk is calculated. If two girls are at your house listening to you and giving you IOIs, the odds are in your favor that something will happen.\" Mystery could be very persuasive. Throughout this whole pickup pro\u00ad cess, I'd been trying on clothes and behaviors I'd never thought were me. Some of them worked, so I kept them; others didn't, so I discarded them. I decided to take a chance. I was willing to risk losing them. I dragged my feet back to Herbal's room. \"Hey, guys,\" I told the girls be\u00ad tween yawns. \"I have to show you these home movies that Mystery and I made. They're hilarious.\" Inspired by our video of Carly and Caroline in Montreal, Mystery had started filming our trips and adventures, editing them into humorous ten-minute shorts. I brought them up to my room. I had no chairs there, of course, just a bed. So we all lay on the comforter while I showed them a video Mystery had made of our trip to Australia. As it ended, I steadied my nerves and took the risk. \"I just experienced the most amazing thing,\" I told the girls. \"I went to San Diego and hung out with my friend Steve P., who's a guru and a shaman. And he had two of his students perform what he called a dual-induction massage on me. Their hands were moving in perfect synchronization on my back. And be\u00ad cause your conscious mind can't process all those movements, it discon- Page 289 273 nects and you feel like there are thousands of hands massaging you. It was amazing.\" If you describe anything with enthusiasm and congruence, people will want to try it\u2014especially if you don't give them the opportunity to say no. \"Get on your stomach,\" I told Isabel. Since she was the girl most likely to be jealous, I knew we'd need to massage her first. I kneeled on her right side and positioned Hea on the left, telling her to follow my movements exactly. When we finished kneading her back, I pulled off my shirt and lay on my stomach. The girls positioned themselves on either side of my back and began massaging me\u2014tentatively at first, then with more confidence. As the two of them leaned over me, their hands tracing circles around my shoulder blades, I could feel the energy in the room begin to charge. The sexual na\u00ad ture of the situation was beginning to dawn on them, if it hadn't already. This was quite possibly going to work. When it was Hea's turn, she took off her shirt and lay on her stomach. This time I made the massage more erotic, rubbing her inner thigh and the sides of her breasts. After her massage, Hea remained on her stomach while Isabel and I kneeled over her. This was the deciding moment. I had to escalate. I was so nervous my hand started shaking, just like at my humiliating high-school lunch with Elisa. I pulled Isabel's face close to mine and began making out with her. As we kissed, I lowered our bodies until we were prac\u00ad tically lying on top of Hea, who was trapped under us. Then I turned Hea's face toward me and began kissing her. She responded. It was working. I gently pulled Isabel into the kiss. Once Hea and Isabel's lips met, the spark of sexual tension that had hung in the room during the massage ex\u00ad ploded. They were all over each other, as if they'd been wanting to do this all along. But they hadn't. They'd been bitter rivals less than an hour earlier. I didn't understand it\u2014but then again I didn't need to. Hea removed Isabel's shirt, and we both began sucking on her breasts. We pulled off her pants and began licking up her",
  "126": "thighs until her back be\u00ad gan to arch. I pulled off Isabel's panties while Hea crawled behind me and struggled with my pants. As I helped her with the button-fly, I glanced at the clock. It was 2:00 AM My heart froze. It had been four hours since my last nap. I couldn't just go to sleep in the middle of the first threesome of my life. But if I didn't, the last four days of sleep deprivation would have been in vain. Page 290 274 \"Hey,\" I told them. \"I hate to do this, but I need to take my twenty- minute nap now. You can join me if you want.\" With Isabel on one side and Hea on the other, I fell asleep instantly. I dreamed that the streets were water, and I was swimming through them. When the alarm went off, I pulled both girls into me, and we began fooling around again. But this time Isabel pulled away. \"This is weird,\" she said. \"It's totally weird,\" I replied. \"I've been thinking the same thing. But it's a new experience, so I'm just going with it.\" She nodded and smiled, and pulled my boxer briefs off. Both women put their hands around me, and I leaned back and watched. I wanted to keep the image in my head for future use. However, when Hea began to give me a blowjob, Isabel's body tensed. I remembered something Rick H. had said about threesomes at David DeAn\u00ad gelo's seminar: The experience has to be about your girlfriend's pleasure, not yours. She has to be the lead sled dog\u2014as he put it\u2014and your main ob\u00ad jective is to make sure she's always comfortable and feeling good. \"Is this making you uncomfortable?\" I asked the lead sled dog. \"A little,\" she said. I guided Hea's head back up, and we lay together, talking and fooling around, until my next nap. I didn't have sex with Hea that night; I knew Is\u00ad abel wouldn't be able to handle seeing me inside another woman. This had already been a big step for her. The next night, I was even more exhausted. Herbal and I sat in the liv\u00ad ing room watching Dangerous Liaisons to stay awake, but we kept drifting into daydreams that lasted fractions of a second. These are called mi\u00ad crosleeps: Our bodies needed rest so badly that they were sneaking naps whenever we weren't paying attention. \"This sleep diet thing was a terrible idea,\" I told Herbal. \"Just stick with it,\" he said. \"It'll pay off in the long run.\" I'd bought several bottles of vitamins to help bolster my immune sys\u00ad tem, but I kept forgetting which ones I had taken and when. Fortunately, Nadia was coming over soon. She was another one of my MLTRs, the sexy librarian I had met during my personals experiment. She showed up after a Suicide Girls burlesque show at the Knitting Factory, accompanied by a girl named Barbara whose black bangs reminded me of Bettie Page. I poured them a drink and we sat on a couch together. Though Barbara Page 291 275 had a boyfriend, I noticed that she was very touchy-feely with Nadia. She seemed to have a crush on her. So I thought I'd give her the opportunity to act on it. I excused myself for my much-needed nap\u2014I dreamed I was stranded naked in an endless snow-covered field\u2014and then called them up to my room to watch my home movies. Afterward, I initiated the dual-induction massage. And, to my surprise, it worked again. The moment they started kissing, the girls devoured each other just like Isabel and Hea had. So it hadn't just been a lucky accident the night before. Unlike Isabel, Nadia was a lead sled dog with no jealousy issues. When I fucked Nadia, Barbara knelt behind me and licked my balls. I wanted to wait and fuck Barbara too, but there would be no waiting. What was occur\u00ad ring was so far beyond my wildest expectations when I'd first joined the community that I just lost it. I couldn't hold out any longer. And I never got to have sex with Barbara. This is what the PUAs call a quality problem. Over the last year and a half, I'd spent a lot of time working on my ap\u00ad pearance, my energy, my attitude, and my state. Yet now, when all those qualities were at their lowest\u2014when I looked and felt",
  "127": "like shit\u2014I'd had the most sexually decadent two days of my life. There was a lesson here: The less you appear to be trying, the better you do. The next day, Herbal and I sat in the living room with a bowl of ice cubes, which we rubbed on ourselves every few minutes to shock our sys\u00ad tems into staying awake. The sleep adjustment process was proving to be more difficult than we had imagined. I began to worry that we were wasting our time. After all, this whole sleep diet hadn't even been scientifically proven. \"There better be a rainbow at the end of this tunnel,\" I babbled to Herbal. \"I mean, we're chasing after the pot of gold at the end of the rain\u00ad bow. And we don't even know if it's there, or if the rainbow even has an end.\" Herbal looked startled; I'd snapped him out of a microsleep. \"I had a dream about gummy worms,\" he slurred. \"Someone was chopping up gummy bears to make gummy worms.\" After another two nap cycles, my head began to hurt and my eyes re\u00ad fused to raise any higher than half-mast. We bathed in cold water, we slapped ourselves in the face, we ran around the living room chasing each other with brooms. But nothing worked. Page 292 276 When I felt my teeth to check my braces, I knew I'd passed over the edge of reason. I hadn't worn braces since junior high. \"I'm going to sleep,\" Herbal finally said. \"We can't,\" I told him. \"If you go to sleep, I won't make it by myself.\" \"Watch out for the toothpicks,\" he said. We both started cracking up. He'd just had a microsleep. Dreams and reality were blurring. \"Just try to make it through one more sleep cycle,\" I told him. But after the next twenty-minute nap, I couldn't get Herbal out of bed. He refused to even open his eyes. I couldn't continue on my own, so I dragged my feet upstairs and drifted into the sweetest slumber of my life. And though I had failed the sleep experiment, I'd reached a new plateau in my game. I know I should be humble about the dual-induction massage and pre\u00ad tend like it was another step down a degrading path. But discovering the se\u00ad cret to threesomes was like finding the Rosetta Stone of pickup. Once the dual-induction massage routine was developed and shared, PUAs all over the world started having threesomes. It was like breaking the three-minute mile. The dual-induction massage would ultimately ensure my ranking as the number one PUA on Thundercat's list for a second year running. Project Hollywood was already a success. Page 293 And then Tyler Durden arrived. He looked like he'd been spray-tanning. \"I know I didn't make a good impression in L.A.,\" he said. He shook my hand. He even looked me in the eye for a microsecond. He wore a trendy black-and-white shirt with ropes hanging from the rib cage area like a corset. It wasn't peacocky; it was the kind of shirt I would have bought. \"Social intelligence is something that hasn't come easy for me,\" he continued. I think he was apologizing. \"I'm still working at it. I can come across as self-centered when I slip. Not cool. I suppose I should be more equipped to, as Mystery always tells me, learn how to sarge guys.\" It was humble of him. He'd done dozens of workshops since we'd met, and I'd been watching his progress online. His students said he now rivaled Mystery in his pickup prowess. I was willing to give him a second chance: maybe he really had done some serious work on himself. That's the idea This community was predicated on, after all. Since we would both be going to Las Vegas to wing one of Mystery's workshops that weekend, I was look\u00ad ing forward to seeing if the stories about his prowess in the field were true. Tyler slung his bag over his shoulder and walked up to Papa's room. Between Papa's newfound passion for business and Tyler Durden's quest to be the community's best pickup artist, they made a perfect team. Our house now had the most admired PUAs in the game. Of course, to the best of my recollection, Tyler Durden had never been approved as a res\u00ad ident. There wasn't room for",
  "128": "anyone else. However, Papa had taken it upon himself to invite him, converting one of his bathroom closets into an extra bedroom by putting a mattress on the floor. We didn't have furniture yet. Just a collection of fifty throw pillows we'd bought to cover the sunken dance floor. That night, Playboy rigged his movie projector to show films on the ceiling, and we all lay in the pillow pit and watched Carnal Knowledge. Afterward, Tyler Durden turned to me. \"Your archive has been really in\u00ad fluential in my game,\" he said. My collected posts on the seduction news- Page 294 278 groups had been compiled into a large text file and posted online along with the archives of Mystery and Ross Jeffries. \"A lot of my best shit I took from there.\" It was hard to get out of a conversation with Tyler Durden. Whenever he wasn't playing the game, he was talking about it. \"I've been experimenting with telling people I'm you in the field,\" Tyler said. \"What do you mean?\" \"I tell them I'm Neil Strauss, and that I write for Rolling Stone.\" \"And does it get results?\" The idea of this pasty little freak running around telling people he was me turned my stomach, but I tried to act nonchalant. \"It depends. Sometimes they think I'm lying. Sometimes girls instantly say, Oh my God, we should hang out'. And other girls, if you tell them that shit, you're blown out because it looks like you're bragging.\" \"Let me tell you something. I've been writing for over a decade, and it hasn't gotten me laid once. Writers aren't cool or sexy. There's no social proof to be gained by hanging out with a writer. At least, that's been my ex\u00ad perience. Why do you think I joined the community? But I'm flattered that you tried.\" That weekend, Tyler Durden, Mystery, and I went to Las Vegas. Papa had booked ten students for Mystery, which was pretty good for a six per\u00ad son workshop. We took them to the Hard Rock Casino. Generally, on the first night, the students watch the instructors work. As a PUA, Tyler Durden had improved drastically since I'd last seen him in Los Angeles, where he didn't talk to any women. When I noticed him sarging a bachelorette party, I inched closer to listen. He was talking about Mystery. \"See that tall guy in the top hat?\" he was telling them. \"He needs a lot of attention, so he'll say hurtful things to people just to make them like him. So humor him, because he needs help.\" He was giving away Mystery's game\u2014neutralizing his negs. \"He likes doing magic tricks to get people to accept him,\" he contin\u00ad ued. \"So just be nice and pretend like you're excited. He does a lot of chil\u00ad dren's birthday parties.\" Now he was neutralizing Mystery's value-demonstrating routines. After Tyler Durden left the set, I asked him what he was doing. \"Papa Page 295 279 and I have developed a lot of new techniques to blow you and Mystery out,\" he said. \"So what do you say about me?\" I asked, trying to pretend I wasn't disturbed. Tyler Durden started laughing. \"We say, 'There's Style. He's actually forty-five years old, but he looks pretty young to me. He's so cute. He's like a little Elmer Fudd.\" I stared at him in disbelief. He was AMOGing his fellow PUAs. It was diabolical. \"You can get me,\" Tyler said. \"You can say I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy.\" I choked back my disgust and thought, \"What would Tom Cruise do?\" \"But I don't want to get you, man,\" I replied, keeping my own counsel and giving him a big smile like I thought it was all very funny. \"Here\\ the difference between you and me: I like to surround myself with people who are better than me because I enjoy being pushed and challenged. You, on the other hand, like to become the best person in the room by eliminating anyone who's better than you.\" \"Yeah, maybe you're right,\" he said. Later, I would realize I was only half right. Tyler Durden did like to eliminate competition. But not before he'd squeezed every piece of useful information out of them. For the rest of the weekend, whenever I talked to a person, male",
  "129": "or fe\u00ad male, Tyler Durden was hovering behind me, listening to every word. I could see him thinking, trying to figure out the rules and patterns behind everything I said that kept me dominant in a group. He had studied my archive. He was studying my personality. Soon, he would no doubt know more about me than I did. And then, as with the AMOGs in Leicester Square, he'd turn my own words and mannerisms against me. At the end of the night, I saw a two-set sitting at the bar in the Peacock Lounge: a tall, creepy, bespectacled brunette with incongruously large fake breasts and a short blonde tomboy with a white beret and a small, thick, curvy body. \"That blonde girl's a porn star,\" Mystery said. He was the expert. \"Her name's Faith. That's your set.\" Despite the year and a half I'd spent in the community, despite being supposedly the best, I was still intimidated when I saw a beautiful woman. Page 296 280 My old AFC self was always threatening to snap back, whispering that everything I'd learned was wrong, that I was bowing before false gods, that all this game talk was just mental masturbation. But I pushed myself to enter the set anyway, just to prove that little AFC voice in the back of my head wrong. As soon as I opened my mouth, I went into autopilot. I opened with jealous girlfriend. I gave myself a time constraint. I negged the target about her hoarse voice. I did the best friends test. C-shaped smiles versus U-shaped smiles. ESP experiment. \"There's so much I can learn from you,\" Faith said. \"We love you,\" gushed her creepy friend. They were eating out of my hands. I'm a nerdy Elmer Fudd spouting bullshit tests I made up, and these two girls whose collective breasts weigh more than me were staring at me rapt. I had nothing to be afraid of. No guy out there had the tools we did. I must kill off that inner AFC. When will he die? I signaled to Mystery to wing the obstacle. As he sat next to the creepy girl, I went back on autopilot. Evolution phase-shift. Smell. Pull hair. Bite arm. Bite neck. \"How do you rate yourself as a kisser on a scale of one to ten?\" Suddenly, Faith jumped out of her seat. \"I'm getting too turned on,\" she said. \"I have to leave.\" I couldn't figure out if she was just giving me an excuse because I had made a mistake at some point in the sarge, or if I was really that good. I approached a nearby set\u2014two hippie girls on a bender\u2014and was in with them instantly. Ten minutes into our conversation, however, Faith re\u00ad turned, grabbed my hand, and said, \"Let's go to the bathroom.\" We walked into the restroom on the side of the Peacock Lounge, and she lowered the toilet seat and sat me down on it. As she unbuttoned my pants, she said, \"You so turn me on, intellectually and sexually.\" Page 297 281 \"I know,\" I told her. \"How?\" \"I felt our connection all night. Even when I was talking to those two other girls, I saw you looking at me.\" She kneeled on the floor, circled her hand around my limp father of thousands, and lowered her mouth over it. But I couldn't get hard. I was overwhelmed. I stood up and pushed her roughly against the wall. I circled my hands around her throat and made out with her, as I'd seen Sin do to women in his house when I was still an AFC. Then I pulled her pants down, sat her on the toilet seat, fingered her, and went down on her. She arched her back, fluttered her eyelids, and moaned, as if she were about to cum; but instead she suddenly switched positions and went down on me again. \"I want you to cum in my mouth,\" she said. I still couldn't get hard. This had never happened to me before. I mean, I'm hard right now as I'm remembering this. \"I want to be inside you,\" I told her, in a last-ditch effort to get my blood flowing to the right place. She stood up and turned around. I pulled a condom out of my pocket and thought about every beautiful woman I had approached that night. I started to get a little harder. She sat down on me, her back against my stom\u00ad ach, which was the worst position",
  "130": "for a semi-erect dick to reach around. As soon as I was partway inside her, I went soft again. I couldn't figure out if it was the two Jack and Cokes I drank that night, the lack of foreplay, the in\u00ad timidation factor of being with a porn star, or the fact that I'd masturbated earlier that day. When we walked out of the bathroom, half the workshop students were standing there waiting for a lay report. One of the hippies I had been talking to before went to the bathroom and emerged afterward with my condom wrapper in a Kleenex. Evidently, I had left it on the floor, and she felt obliged to show it around. Everyone was celebrating a feat that hadn't actually happened. I couldn't look Faith in the eye afterward. I had built myself up as such a mysterious, fascinating, sexually powerful guy. And then, in the moment of truth, the lies had come crashing down, revealing a skinny bald guy with a limp dick. Page 298 On the last night of the Las Vegas workshop, Tyler Durden picked up a hostess named Stacy at the Hard Rock Cafe. She was a vampirish blonde who listened to new metal. When her shift ended, Stacy met us at the casino and brought along her roommate, Tammy, a quiet beauty with a touch of baby fat and a scent of grape Bubblicious. I was wearing a ridiculous snakeskin suit; Mystery was dressed in a top hat, flight goggles, six-inch platform boots, black latex pants, and a black T-shirt with a scrolling red digital sign that said \"Mystery\" on it. Even for Vegas, he looked like a freak. Within minutes, Tyler Durden was AMOGing him to Stacy. \"He wears these weird signs and people laugh at him,\" he told her. \"I always tell him he doesn't need to do that for people to accept him.\" The students fanned the room to talk to women as I leaned against the bar and watched them. After awhile, Stacy sidled up next to me. She had been watching me lead the workshop and, from sheer social proof (lead the men and you lead the women), she had become interested. As we talked, she held eye contact with me. She played with her hair. She looked for excuses to touch my arm. She leaned in when I leaned back. All the IOIs were there. I could feel the air around us tingle, as it always does when a potential kiss is accumulating energy. I knew it was wrong. She was Tyler Durden's girl. There's a PUA code of ethics: The first one to approach a set gets to game the target, until either she submits or he gives up. But a PUA also doesn't AMOG his wing. If Tyler Durden was going to tell girls I was Elmer Fudd, then Elmer Fudd was go\u00ad ing to hunt his rabbit. I stroked her hair. She smiled. Would she like to kiss me? She would. We did. Then a shock of orangey blonde hair appeared in the periphery of my vision. It was Mr. Heat Miser. And he was pissed. Page 299 \"Come with me,\" Tyler Durden said, grabbing her arm. I started to apologize. What I had done was wrong, and I knew it logi\u00ad cally. But when that bubble of connection and passion builds around you and a girl, logic goes out the window and instinct takes over. I had fucked up. Sure, he'd been AMOGing me. But two wrongs don't make a right. I felt like shit. However, consolation was only a few steps away. Tyler took Stacy to our hotel room, leaving her roommate, Tammy, behind. We were making out within five minutes. I couldn't believe how easy this was. She was the sixth girl I'd made out with that weekend. Mystery, in the meantime, had picked up a scantily clad stripper named Angela who, in his estimation, was a 10.5. So we decided to ditch the workshop\u2014it was 2:00 A.M. and they'd gotten their money's worth\u2014and take our dates to an after hours club called Dre's. As we walked to the cab stand, Mystery paused and looked at himself in the casino mirror. \"Winning feels good,\" he said, grinning to his reflection, which grinned right back at him. In the taxi, Angela sat on Mystery's lap, facing him, with her skirt spread over his knees. Before we were even out of the parking lot, they were making out. She bit her",
  "131": "lip before they kissed. She softly moaned every time their lips separated. She sucked his index finger in and out of her mouth. She was performing for him, for us, for the less attractive masses outside, for God above. Everyone we drove past yelled and whistled at the lip-locked pair. In response, she arched her back and pulled her white panties to the side, revealing a patch of pubic hair shaved into a perfect teardrop. Mystery put a finger inside her. He was validated. She was validated. They validated each other. They were a perfect pair, each completely unaware of the other. At 5:00 A.M., when Angela left to drive back to Los Angeles, Mystery, Tammy, and I took a cab to the hotel room we were sharing with Tyler Dur\u00ad den at the Luxor. I collapsed onto the bed with Tammy, and we started making out. Mystery was on the other bed. Tyler was in a chair, with Stacy in his lap. Tammy took off her top and bra, and then lowered my pants. She wrapped her hand around me, and started working it up and down while twisting her wrist. Her mouth joined her hand. This time my equipment worked, no problem. I guess something about the combination of whisky, porn stars, and public bathrooms was too cliche even for me. Page 300 284 Tammy took her pants off, and I reached into my jeans pocket and put a condom on. But after having sex with her for a minute, I stopped. The boys were there. They were watching, or maybe they were trying not to watch. I had no idea; I was too scared to look at them. I've never had sex with other guys in the room, let alone PUAs. Tammy didn't seem to have any qualms about it. I admired her for that. Nonetheless, I picked her up, brought her into the shower, and turned on the water. I pressed her against the shower door, smashing her breasts against the glass, and took her from behind. After five minutes of thrusting, the bathroom door burst open and a flash went off. Mystery, Tyler Durden, and Stacy were standing there, taking photos. All I could think was, \"They have dirt on me now.\" I didn't realize until later that to them it was just a souvenir of good times in Las Vegas. Just as with the New York Times article, I was the only one worried about being ex\u00ad posed. Everyone else was simply having fun at a friends' expense. I had to get it through my head that these guys didn't care about the writer Neil Strauss. They were so entrenched in the community that nothing outside of it mattered or seemed real. Newspapers only came across their radar if they happened to run a science article about animal mating habits. If a dis\u00ad aster struck somewhere in the world, it was just material for a pattern about taking advantage of the moment because you never know what will happen tomorrow. Afterward, the girls invited us to their place for breakfast. We packed our bags, drove to their apartment, and ate the best bacon and eggs of our lives. Tyler Durden and Mystery sat on the couch and talked openly about their pickup business: I could see they were squaring off. Mystery kept call\u00ad ing him a former student; Tyler Durden felt like he had surpassed his mas\u00ad ter and was offering an entirely new and original method of seduction. The sun was up, and I didn't feel like talking about pickup when I had a real live girl I could be sleeping with. So Tammy took me to her room and gave me a blowjob, and then I slept for two hours before my flight home. There was something about her bed\u2014the way it filled the room, the im\u00ad maculate whiteness, the softness of the sheets, the thickness of the com\u00ad forter, the tightness of the tucked-in bedding\u2014that was intoxicating. I've always loved women's bedrooms: They're soft and sweet-smelling, like heaven must be. Page 301 Mystery and Tyler Durden weren't leaving Vegas until the evening, so they stayed with the girls and I took a cab to the airport alone. On the flight home, I had a dream: I pick up a woman and go back to her house. She takes me to her room, and I struggle with last minute resistance for",
  "132": "hours. All night long, it's push- pull, submit-resist. Finally, I give up and go to sleep. In the morning, I'm sitting on a couch in her living room. Her room\u00ad mate, a Latin woman with bright red lipstick, saunters up to me and says, \"I'm sorry my roommate isn't putting out, but you can be with me instead if you want.\" She sits on the couch and spreads her legs in the air. She isn't wearing anything below the waist. She repeats her offer. I accept. Her lipstick smears across my face as we make out. But when it comes time to have sex, though my dick looks hard, it isn't rigid. I feel like I'm try\u00ad ing to stuff a Twinkie inside her. Afterward, my original target walks in. That's what I call her in my dream: my target. I try to hide my lipstick-stained mouth as we talk. I can hear her roommate laughing from somewhere behind me. And I know I've just failed a planned test by cheating on the girl who brought me home. Now she'll never like me, because she knows what I'm really like. That night, the girls have a party. Mystery is hitting on my target. He gives her a garage-door opener as a gift. When no one is looking, I grab it and walk outside. I keep pressing it, figuring that a door will open some\u00ad where with a spectacular present for her. While I am investigating, Mystery comes outside, looking for the girl. It turns out that the gift was part of a routine\u2014a way to get her outside in pri\u00ad vate. By pressing the button, I had paged him. I run down the street at top speed, but within seconds Mystery catches up to me. His legs are so long it isn't even a challenge for him. \"I'm pissed at you for hitting on my target,\" I say. \"You had your chance with her and nothing happened,\" he replies. \"The window closed and now it's my turn.\" Page 302 286 When I woke up, I understood the part of the dream about the test right away. I'd failed it by making out with Tyler Durden's target. And after my disaster with the porn star, the impotence was self-explanatory. But I couldn't understand the part about Mystery hitting on my target\u2014that is, until I returned home and Mystery called. \"I hope you don't mind,\" he said, \"but Tammy just gave me a blowjob. She swallowed my load.\" Somewhere in her stomach, my sperm was mingling with Mystery's. \"I don't mind,\" I said. And I didn't. It was part of being friends\u2014a play\u00ad ful competition between PUAs. \"Just remember that I was there first.\" Tyler Durden, however, didn't see it that way. It wasn't playful competi\u00ad tion to him. It was his life. He would never forgive me for making out with his target. Page 303 The point was women; the result was men. Instead of models in bikinis lounging by the Project Hollywood pool all day, we had pimply teenagers, bespectacled businessmen, tubby stu\u00ad dents, lonely millionaires, struggling actors, frustrated taxi drivers, and computer programmers\u2014lots of computer programmers. They walked in our door AFCs; they came out players. Every Friday when they arrived, Mystery or Tyler Durden stood in front of the pillow pit and taught them pretty much the same openers, body lan\u00ad guage tips, and value-demonstrating routines. On Saturday afternoon, they all went shopping on Melrose. They bought the same four-inch-platform New Rock boots and black-and-white striped shirt with bits of rope hang\u00ad ing from the sides. They bought the same rings, necklaces, hats, and sun\u00ad glasses. They went to the tanning salon. We were breeding an army. At night they descended on the Sunset Strip, a swarm of player bees. Even when the seminar and workshop ended, students lingered in the clubs on Sunset for months afterward, working on their game. You could spot them from behind by the matching boots and the rope dangling from their shirts. They clustered in groups, prowling for open sets and sending in emissaries to say, \"Hey, I need to get a female opinion on something.\" Even on nights when there weren't workshops, badly peacocked guys from a hundred-mile radius gathered in our living room before going",
  "133": "out. At 2:30 A.M., they reconvened at the house\u2014either accompanied by drunk, giggling girls from Orange County, who they brought to the Jacuzzi, the terrace, the closets, and the pillow pit, or empty-handed and breaking down their approaches until dawn. They couldn't stop talking about this stuff. \"Do you know why my skill set is better than all my friends?\" Tyler Durden said one afternoon, as he plopped down in the booth at Mel's next to me. \"There is only one fucking reason.\" \"You're more sensitive?\" I asked. Page 304 \"No, because I plow!\" he said with a triumphant flourish. By \"plowing,\" he meant blitzing a girl with line after line, routine after routine, without even waiting for a response. \"The other night, this girl was running away, and I screamed the routine at her. She came back like a fucking tractor beam. I have no regard for social conventions: I'll pummel their asses down. You have to plow it. No situation can't be plowed.\" \"I don't plow,\" I told him. There were guys who won girlfriends by chas\u00ad ing them until they relented and agreed to meet. But I wasn't a chaser. I wasn't a plower. All I did was give her the opportunity to like me, and either she did or didn't. Usually she did. \"You just fucking push push push, and it can't not work,\" Tyler Dur- den went on. \"If the girls get mad at me, I'll change my voice tone and apol\u00ad ogize and tell them I'm not well socially calibrated.\" I watched Tyler Durden as he spoke. For all his talk about women, I rarely saw him in the company of one. \"Maybe the reason I'm not getting into a lot of relationships,\" he said as we left the diner, \"is that I don't like oral sex.\" \"Giving or receiving?\" \"Both.\" That's when I realized that Tyler Durden wasn't in the community to get laid. He wasn't motivated by sex. He was motivated by power. Papa's motivations were harder to determine. Originally, he was in the game for the girls. When we moved into Project Hollywood, he envisioned turning his room into a high-tech sultan's lair, with a harem just a phone call away. He talked about getting a bed like a throne, a high-end home en\u00ad tertainment center, a bar next to the fireplace, and drapery hanging from the ceiling. But that's not what his room became. When I returned from Mel's with Tyler, Mystery was in Papa's room, arguing. \"You're giving Tyler Durden more students than you're giving me,\" Mystery was saying. \"I'm trying to make this win-win for everyone,\" Papa protested. The ex\u00ad pression seemed hollower every time he used it. As I looked around his room, I was appalled. There was hardly any fur\u00ad niture, just sleeping bags and pillows strewn across the floor. Women have one word for bedrooms like this: dealbreaker. \"Who's living here?\" I asked. Page 305 \"Some of the RSD11 guys.\" \"How many people?\" \"Well, right now, Tyler Durden and Sickboy are in the closets in my bathroom. And I have three boot camp students sleeping in the room.\" \"If anyone's staying more than a month, they need to be approved, like we agreed at the house meeting. There are enough guys in the house as it is.\" \"Outstanding,\" Papa said. \"If they're using the resources of the house, they should be paying,\" Mystery said. Papa looked at him blankly. \"I can't talk to that guy,\" Mystery complained to me. \"He just sits there and stares at you and says, 'Outstanding.' He's so fucking passive.\" \"That's not true,\" Papa said. \"You think you can push me around be\u00ad cause I was a former student.\" I'd never seen Papa upset before. He didn't get loud, like most people; instead, his voice became very stuffy. Somewhere inside, there was a living, breathing, emotional person waiting to be set free. After that day, Papa stopped entering the house through the front door. Instead, in order to avoid Mystery, he walked all the way around the back to the patio and climbed a staircase that led to a door in his bathroom. All his guests did the same. An acronym for Real Social Dynamics. See glossary. Page 306 My father died when I was forty And",
  "134": "I couldn't find a way to cry Not because I didn't love him Not because he didn't try I'd cried for every lesser thing Whiskey, pain, and beauty But he deserved a better tear And I was not quite ready The lyrics boomed through the living room. Mystery was lying in the pillow pit with his computer on his chest. He was playing the song \"The Randall Knife\" by Guy Clark over and over. He seemed to be in need of attention. So I walked over and gave him some. \"My dad died,\" he said. His voice was flat and even. It was hard to tell if he was sad or not. \"It's about time. It happened very quickly. He had an\u00ad other stroke, and then he died at 10:00 A.M. today.\" I sat down next to him and listened to him talk. He was a passive ob\u00ad server of himself, analytically deconstructing his emotions as he felt them. \"Even though I was ready for it, it's strange. It's like when Johnny Cash died. You knew it was going to happen, but it was still a shock.\" Mystery had hated his dad his whole life and wished death on him countless times. But now that it had happened, he didn't know how to feel. He seemed confused that he felt a little sad, despite himself. \"The only times we ever bonded were when a hot woman came on TV,\" he said. \" Then he'd look at me and I'd look at him, and we'd quietly appre\u00ad ciate it together.\" A few days later, we hosted the first annual Pickup Artist Summit at our house. PUAs from around the world flew in to speak, and several hun\u00ad dred rAFCs (recovering average frustrated chumps) gathered in our living room to hear them. Our housemates Playboy and Xaneus, who Papa and Page 307 291 Tyler Durden had been training to become instructors, opened the pro\u00ad ceedings. As Playboy discussed body language, I thought back to Belgrade and the first workshop I'd taught with Mystery. I remembered too-cool Exoti- coption, Sasha skipping down the street with his first e-mail-close, and Jerry's sense of humor. I loved those guys. I cared about them. I wanted them to get laid. I e-mailed them for months afterward, checking on their progress. Now I looked around the living room and saw neediness and hunger and desperation. Bald guys with goatees\u2014miniature and super-sized ver\u00ad sions of myself\u2014asked me to pose for photos with them. Good-looking guys who could have been models clamored for advice on hairstyles and clothes to buy, and then asked me to pose for photos with them. Two gangly brothers at the convention\u2014both virgins\u2014brought their sister along. She was a quiet nineteen-year-old imp with large eyes, gum- drop breasts, and a hip-hop fashion sense. Thanks to her brothers, she knew everything about the game. When guys approached her with cocky funny lines, she told them, \"Don't try that David DeAngelo stuff on me. I've read it all.\" She introduced herself as Min, and then asked me to pose for a photo with her. \"I'm a big fan of your posts,\" she said. \"You've read them?\" I asked, shocked. \"Yeah.\" She bit her lip. For my presentation, I brought in five of the girls I was dating. I ran routines on them, and then used them as a panel of experts to critique the clothing and body language of various wanna-be players in the audience. I received a standing ovation. Afterward, I sat on our newly purchased blood-red couches surrounded by Papa, Tyler Durden, and a few of their students. They were discussing the video of Mystery and I picking up Caroline and Carry. Somehow, Gun- witch had gotten hold of it and put it on the Internet, shattering what was left of my anonymity. \"It's so genius,\" Papa was saying. \"Tyler Durden has broken down everything Style does to a science. He calls it Stylemogging.\" \"What's that?\" one of the students asked. \"It's a type of frame control,\" Tyler Durden replied. A frame is an NLP term: It is the perspective through which one sees the world. Whoever's Page 308 232 frame\u2014or subjective reality\u2014is the strongest tends to dominate an interac\u00ad tion. \"Style has all these really subtle ways of keeping control of the frame and",
  "135": "getting people to qualify themselves to him. He makes sure that the fo\u00ad cus is always on him. I'm writing a post about it.\" \"That's awesome,\" I said. Suddenly, Papa, Tyler Durden, and the students laughed. \"That's one of the things you do,\" Papa said. \"Tyler's writing about that.\" \"What? I just said 'awesome.' That's because I think it's hilarious. Seri\u00ad ously, I can't wait to read it.\" They all laughed again. Evidently I was Stylemogging them. \"See,\" Tyler Durden said. \"You'll use curiosity as a frame to get rapport and make the other person lose social value. When you show approval like that, it makes you the authority and makes other people want to seek your validation. We're teaching that.\" \"Shit,\" I replied. \"Now, every time I say something, people are going to think I'm running a Real Social Dynamics routine.\" They all laughed again. And that's when I realized that I was fucked: Everything Tyler Durden was writing about wasn't anything I had learned in the community. That was all part of me and who I really was. And even though he had my intentions wrong\u2014that was his frame, his way of looking at the world\u2014he had my mannerisms down. He was taking the building blocks of my personality, giving them names, and turning them into rou\u00ad tines. He was going to take my soul and spread it all over the Sunset Strip. Page 309 On the last day of the summit, Mystery had a brainstorm: He was going to raise the price of his workshop from six hundred dollars to fifteen hundred. He wanted Papa to change the website to reflect the increase. \"That doesn't make sense,\" Papa protested. \"The market won't support that.\" Papa rarely went out anymore. Instead, he spent his nights working on the Real Social Dynamics website and Internet affiliate program. Since we'd moved into the house, I'd seen him with a woman exactly once. \"It's my method,\" Mystery said. \"People will pay. I've worked it all out.\" \"It's not practical.\" Papa stared straight through Mystery's chest. He didn't like confrontation. \"This is unacceptable!\" Mystery stomped through the living room, where Extramask was giving a presentation. Extramask had arrived in town a week before the seminar and was sleeping somewhere in the house\u2014I wasn't sure exactly where, since Papa had run out of closets to stuff people into. I had hardly talked to Extramask since he'd arrived. He was always either in Papa's room working for Real So\u00ad cial Dynamics, winging a workshop with Tyler Durden, or working out. I watched him for a few minutes. He was buff now, wearing a torn T-shirt and a loosely knotted tie. He was telling the students that he hadn't lost his virginity\u2014or even held a girl's hand\u2014until he was twenty-six-and- a-half It was a gimmick now, part of his routine for guys. He had become a guru too. And, along the way, he'd lost the innocence he had when we first met. \"I do a lot of things with this cell phone, and it doesn't even work,\" he said, holding it up. \"I just like to talk into it and pretend that I'm the man, especially if I feel uncomfortable at a club. Your cell phone is your best wingman.\" Extramask had great stage presence and an oddball sense of humor. I wished he'd spend more time working on his stand-up comedy career than teaching seduction. Unlike Mystery and Tyler Durden, he wasn't born for this. Page 310 I followed Mystery into the kitchen. He was leaning against a counter, waiting for me. \"Papa's been doing workshops behind my back,\" he fumed. \"Someone told me they saw him at the Highlands with six guys last weekend.\" I hopped onto the counter and sat at eye level with him. \"Let me catch you up to speed on what else has been going on,\" he said. I assumed he was going to complain about Papa, but instead he wanted to talk about Patricia. She had started dating an African-American jock she'd met at her strip club, and now she was pregnant with his baby. Though she had no plans to marry him, she wanted to keep the child. Her biological alarm clock was still ringing. \"I'm trying",
  "136": "to look at this objectively,\" Mystery said, straddling a chair at the breakfast table that no one used. \"I'm not angry. But I am hurt. It makes me want to kill the baby and kill him.\" Among the required reading for all PUAs were books on evolutionary theory: The Red Queen by Matt Ridley, The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, Sperm Wars by Robin Baker. You read them, and you understand why women tend to like jerks, why men want so many sexual partners, and why so many people cheat on their spouses. At the same time, however, you un\u00ad derstand that the violent impulses most of us successfully repress are actu\u00ad ally normal and natural. For Mystery, a Darwinist by nature, these books gave him an intellectual justification for his antisocial emotions and his de\u00ad sire to harm the organism that had mated with his woman. It was not a healthy thing. Tyler Durden walked into the kitchen and saw Mystery moping at the table. \"You know what you need to do?\" he told Mystery. \"You need to sarge.\" Sarging was Tyler Durden's solution for everything: He truly believed in it. Picking up women could cure all problems\u2014depression, inertia, ani\u00ad mosity, colitis, lice. Though I'd moved into the house to build a lifestyle, for Tyler Durden sarging was the only way to live. He never went on dates. In\u00ad stead he brought women to the clubs on Sunset, and then usually ditched them to pick up more girls. \"You need to get out of the house,\" Tyler continued. \"Go out with Style tonight. You guys have super-tight game. You can find a new girlfriend twice as hot as Patricia.\" Next, the virgin brothers came into the kitchen, with their sister Min Page 311 and a shaven-headed PUA in tow. It seemed like wherever I was during the convention, a small group gathered, and I wound up holding court. \"You had the best presentation of the day,\" the bald PUA said. \"You were so gentle and elegant with those girls. It was like watching a beauti\u00ad fully choreographed dance.\" \"Thanks, man. What's your name?\" \"I'm Stylechild.\" For the first time in months, I was speechless. \"I named myself after you.\" As he told me about his luckless life and his discovery of the commu\u00ad nity and my posts, I saw Min looking at me with her impish eyes. And I made the conscious decision not to game her, because that's what all the other guys at the seminar were doing. Besides the girls I had used in my pre\u00ad sentation, she had been the only woman in the house all weekend. That night at the Saddle Ranch, Min's eyes were still burning a hole in my head. I had to say something\u2014but it couldn't be anything she'd read on\u00ad line or heard from her brothers. \"Listen,\" I finally told her. \"I'm about to sign up to ride the mechanical bull. Why don't you join me?\" It wasn't a line: I still had designs on that mechanical bull. In many ways, it reminded me of the game. It had eleven settings, from ridiculously easy to fiendishly difficult. And ever since I'd first set eyes on the bull, it had been my goal to get to the top setting\u2014the mythical eleven. So far, I'd only made it to ten. It was a completely pointless ambition, with no practical application whatsoever. But if you sit the average male down in front of anything halfway intriguing and explain to him that it has a system of rankings that he can get better at over time, he'll become obsessed. Hence the popularity of video games, martial arts, Dungeons and Dragons, and the seduction community. I asked the bull-wrangler to set the machine to eleven, gave him a five- dollar tip to make sure he went easy on me, then climbed through the gate and mounted the bull. I was wearing leather pants\u2014not to peacock, but to help me stick to the sides of the machine. The first time I rode it, my thighs were black-and-blue the next day, and I could hardly walk. I understood then what a woman must feel like after sex with a three-hundred-pound guy. I pressed my crotch firmly against the front of the saddle, clamped my Page 312 296 legs against the flank of the bull, and raised",
  "137": "my hand to signal I was ready. In an instant the machine shuddered to life, vibrating me so quickly that my eyes lost focus. I remember feeling my brain about to fall out of my skull, my hips rocking faster than they'd ever moved before, my legs losing their grip, and my crotch jackhammering into the saddle handle in time with the bull. But just as I was about to slide off the side, the bull stopped. I had lasted seven seconds. At first, I was elated. I felt like I had accomplished something\u2014even though it was really nothing. It wouldn't change my life, or the life of any\u00ad one around me in the least. I began to wonder why I had cared so much. Within minutes, I already had buyer's remorse. Afterward, Min said she was tired and asked me to walk her back to Project Hollywood. I understood the subtext. As we ambled back to the mansion arm-in-arm, she talked about her older brothers and their difficulty learning the game. \"They're real protec\u00ad tive and get mad when I go on dates,\" she said. \"But I think they're jealous because they're not going on dates themselves.\" When we returned to Project Hollywood, I brought her to the Jacuzzi. \"My last boyfriend was the sweetest guy, and he did everything for me,\" she went on. \"But I didn't like him. He got on my nerves. After I started reading my brothers' pickup stuff, I understood why I wasn't attracted to him or any of the other guys at school. They're all so boring. They don't un\u00ad derstand cocky funny.\" I stripped down to my boxers and jumped in the water, soothing my bull-bucked wounds. She joined me in her bra and panties. She was thin and delicate, like a marionette. I took her hands and pulled her toward me. She straddled my legs, and we began making out. I took her bra off and put her gumdrops in my mouth. Then I carried her naked and dripping to my bedroom, put on a condom, and slowly entered her. There was no LMR. By looking up to me so much, her brothers had driven her into my arms. She was my first groupie. And she would not be my last. This whole PUA thing was getting too big. With so many new competing seduction businesses aggressively marketing their services online, the community was growing exponentially, especially in Southern California, where the Sunset Strip was transforming before our eyes. No woman was safe. Workshops of fifteen people wandered the street Page 313 297 like gangs. Bands of former students patrolled every club\u2014the Standard, Dublin's, the Saddle Ranch, Miyagi's. When the bars closed at 2:00 A.M., they'd invade Mel's, walking up and down the aisles, seating themselves at any table with a female. They carted women into the house by the truckload. And they were all using my material. They were running around Style- mogging and delivering the best-friends test like they were Spanish flys. In every club, I saw their shaven heads, their diabolical goatees, their shoes that looked like the pair I'd bought in the Beverly Center a week before. Mini-mes were everywhere. And there was nothing I could do about it. Page 314 MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: My Approach Schedule AUTHOR: Adonis After getting fired from my job (too much time in the lounge, lol), I moved to LA last week to devote myself full-time to getting this game handled. I've al\u00ad ways felt like the odd guy out here because I'm still a virgin and kind of a key\u00ad board jockey, so I have locked off Saturday and decided to do a hundred approaches in a single day. I am going to start out on Melrose between La Brea and Fairfax in the afternoon. I figure I can do ten approaches per hour for five hours, yielding fifty approaches. (Does anyone know the name of the store where they sell the New Rock boots?) Afterward, I'm going to shower up, hit Sunset, and cover four bars (Dublin's, Miyagi's, the Saddle Ranch, the Stan\u00ad dard), making twelve to fifteen approaches in each. A hundred approaches should be no problem. Even if I crash and burn every time, at least I will con\u00ad quer my fear of rejection. \u2014Adonis",
  "138": "MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: 1 25 Approaches! AUTHOR: Adonis Guys, this Saturday rocked. I got through 1 25 approaches. It was phenome\u00ad nal. Before I left, I listened to Ross Jeffries's Unstoppable Confidence tapes. They really help. I pictured myself forty feet tall and made of diamond, so no one could hurt me. The opinion opener I used was the RSD classic, \"Who lies more, men or women?\" At first, HBs gave me funny looks, like I was taking a survey. It really started clicking for me at the Saddle Ranch. I think I opened every woman there. One HB8 offered me an e-mail address, but I pushed for a number close and lost it completely. Fuck! Lesson learned. Afterward, I went to the Standard, Page 315 299 and there were already two workshops there. Practically every set there had been approached already with the \"who lies more\" opener, so I started open\u00ad ing people in the street outside. I would recommend that anyone starting out go and do this. (But make sure you've broken in your New Rocks first, lol!) I have now decided to try to get 1,000 approaches under my belt before the end of the month. My open\u00ad ing game is going to be supertight, and I will no longer be resentful of women and fear their power to make me feel inadequate. \u2014Adonus MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: My Thousandth Approach AUTHOR Adonis I have kept score of every approach I have done and, as promised, I just got through my thousandth approach\u2014and still with four days left in the month! I can say after a thousand approaches, there are only so many ways to get rejected or ignored. It doesn't hurt at all anymore because why should someone who's a complete stranger have any control over your sense of self- worth? The other thing I learned is to challenge or intrigue HBs right away instead of trying to be logical or factual. I can stay in sets now for ten or fifteen min\u00ad utes. I have been Stylemogging too, which was hard at first. But now I'm find\u00ad ing it easier to control a set, despite my size (I'm 5'4\"). I am even isolating and doing the cube sometimes, and getting the odd phone number. I feel like I've become a new, more confident person, with no social fears. Before, I was so insecure and self-conscious that people avoided me; now when I walk down the street, I radiate. HBs can just sense it. I strongly recommend that everyone try this. Its worth it. Next month, I'm going to master phone game\u2014a thousand phone calls, lol. If I keep this up, I should be getting laid by the end of the year. \u2014Adonis Page 316 MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Are You A Social Robot? AUTHOR: Style Have you ever noticed that there's something strange about a lot of guys in the community? Its as if just by looking at them, you can tell that something is missing. They don't seem entirely human. Some of these guys even do well in the field. They get great reactions\u2014 sometimes even numbers and lays\u2014but they never seem to have a girlfriend. Are you one of these guys? To find out, ask yourself the following questions: * Do you panic if you run out of \"material\" during a conversation with a woman? * Do you think that everything a woman says to you that isn't 100 percent positive is a \"shit test'? * Do you see every other male who is interacting with a woman as an AMOG who must be destroyed? * Are you unable to discuss a woman without first asking, \"What's her rating?\" * Do you call women in your life who you are not sleeping with \"pivots\" in\u00ad stead of friends? * If you are around a woman in a non-social setting, such as a business meeting or a nursing home, do you get a strange shot of adrenaline and feel obligated to sarge her? * Have you stopped seeing value in things that are not pickup related, such as books, movies, friends, family, work, school, food, and water? * Is your self-esteem constantly at the mercy of the reactions of women? Page 317 301 Then you may be a social robot. Most of the sargers I know are social robots. This is especially true among those who found the",
  "139": "community in their teens or early twenties. Because they haven't had much real-world experience, they have learned to socialize almost entirely through rules and theories they've read online and learned in workshops. They may never be normal again. After a great twenty-minute set with many of these social robots, a woman begins to realize that they don't have anything more going for them. And then they post online complaining that women are flakes. The Internet newsgroups and the pickup lifestyle can give you so much\u2014I know its given me so much\u2014but it can take away a lot too. You can end up becoming a one-dimensional person. You start to think that everyone else around you is a social robot too and begin to read too much into his or her actions. The solution is to remember that the best way to pick up women is to have something better to do than to pick up women. Some guys give up everything\u2014school, work, even girlfriends\u2014to learn the game. But all these things are what make one complete and enhance one's attractiveness to the opposite sex. So put your life back in balance. If you can make something of yourself, women will flock to you, and what you've learned here will prepare you to deal with them. \u2014Style Page 318 \"I can't just tell students not to come to your workshop.\" Mystery and Papa were arguing again. \"You booked too many students,\" Mystery said, throwing his hands up, exasperated. \"It's not fun for me. And it's not fair to them.\" \"And you're making my business look bad.\" Papa's voice was stuffy with pent-up frustration. \"Fine,\" Mystery yelled. \"Then take my name off your website. Our busi\u00ad ness relationship is through. I don't want anything to do with Real Social Dynamics.\" It was a doomed partnership to begin with. The next day, Herbal offered to be Mystery's business partner. It seemed as if he'd been laying low the whole time, waiting for his moment to get involved in the pickup business. Since he'd arrived at the house, he hadn't been with a single woman besides Sima, an ex-MLTR of Mystery's who had moved to Los Angeles from Toronto. When Mystery and Sima started getting on each other's nerves shortly after her arrival in town, she started showing IOIs to Herbal. Instead of getting upset, Mystery sat Herbal down and told him everything he needed to do to sarge her. Sima and Herbal ended up fooling around that night. Afterward, it only served to strengthen Mystery and Herbal's friendship. But they seemed unaware of something that everyone else around them realized: a bad precedent was be\u00ad ing set. Once Herbal started working for Mystery, we truly became a house di\u00ad vided: There was Real Social Dynamics, encamped in Papa's room, and Mystery Method, which had the rest of the house. I was the only person under the roof who wasn't on the payroll of ei\u00ad ther. But that didn't stop Papa from snubbing me along with Mystery and Herbal. I was guilty by association. If Papa and I happened to bump into each other as he snuck around the back of the house, he'd walk past with a brusque hello, staring vacantly through me. He wasn't angry. He was just operating on some sort of program that Page 319 3D3 didn't include me. The curious thing is: Most robots don't program them\u00ad selves. In the meantime, every single rule we had laid down at the house meeting\u2014requiring approval for guests, giving the house a percentage of seminar money, not hitting on another PUA's woman\u2014was bypassed and ignored. We had no idea how many students, sargers, and instructors Papa was packing into his room. They scurried around the house like peacocked rats. We didn't even bother to lock the doors anymore. His latest recruits were two interns who looked like younger versions of himself. No one knew their names. They were known simply as the mini-Papas. The mini-Papas were just as cold to me as Papa was, but they were con\u00ad stantly around. They watched my every move, as if it were an assignment they'd been given. Sometimes I'd see them sitting at Mel's Diner",
  "140": "with Tyler Durden. The three of them would be talking about me. \"He'll reposition his body to steer the conversation in his direction.\" \"He'll leave at times to show scarcity.\" \"If you make a joke, he exaggerates it to steal the glory.\" \"If someone asks him to do a routine, he'll say, In the field,' so that it's on his time and the person appreciates it more.\" They weren't criticizing me. They were trying to model me. Yet, oddly, they never hung out with me as friends. They just wanted to listen and ab\u00ad sorb and take notes. It was dehumanizing. But then again, no one in that house seemed entirely human to begin with. I needed to get out of there. Fortunately, Rolling Stone wanted me to tackle another tough subject. Her name was Courtney Love. The interview was scheduled to take place for one hour at the Virgin Records office in New York. Courtney was at the peak of her infamy at the time. That week she'd bared her breasts to David Letterman on network TV; appeared on the front page of the New York Post with one of her mammaries in the mouth of a stranger outside Wendy's; and been arrested for allegedly hitting a fan in the head with a microphone stand during a concert. On top of all that, she was facing drug charges and had recently lost custody of her daughter. The Rolling Stone story was the first interview she'd agreed to do since all the trouble went down. When I met her at Virgin, Courtney was wearing a black dress with a Page 320 304 sash wrapped tastefully around her torso. Her lips were painted red and full. Considering the number of ugly tabloid headlines featuring her name, Courtney looked good\u2014pale, thin, statuesque. Soon, however, the sash was loose and dangling behind her like a tail and the lipstick was smeared. It seemed like a metaphor for her life: constantly unraveling. \"If you guys are waiting for me to die, you're going to have to wait a long time,\" she began. I was the press; I was the enemy. \"My grandmother didn't die until she was a hundred and two.\" This is what PUAs call a bitch shield. It was nothing personal, just a protective mechanism. I couldn't let it faze me. I had to get rapport and show her I was human, not just another bloodsucking journalist. \"I still have nightmares about my grandmother,\" I told her, \"because the last time I had the chance to see her alive, we had plans to go to the Art Institute of Chicago. And I blew her off because I wanted to sleep late.\" We fluffed for a while about our families. She didn't like hers very much. Now we were getting somewhere. As the interview continued, I hit the hook point. She looked up at me and the walls came down. Her face flushed, the muscles in her cheeks clamped, and the tears started dripping. \"I need to be saved,\" she sobbed. \"You need to save me.\" Now we had rapport. Rapport equals trust plus comfort. When our hour was up, Courtney suggested exchanging phone num\u00ad bers. She said she'd call me later that night to continue the interview. I was relieved, because an hour-long discussion in a record company office wouldn't have made for a very interesting profile. At least Tom Cruise had taken me motorcycle-riding and Scientology-sightseeing. That night, I met some old college friends at Soho House, a private club in the meatpacking district of Manhattan. I hadn't seen them since I'd joined the community, and they hardly recognized me. They spent a half hour discussing how awkward and introverted I used to be. Then their con\u00ad versation turned to work and movies. I tried to contribute, but I had trou\u00ad ble focusing on the words. They just floated into my ear and accumulated there like wax. I felt like I didn't fit in with them anymore. Fortunately, an Amazonian woman with tree-trunk thighs and a lethal boob-job soon stumbled past the table. She was a foot taller than me and somewhat drunk. Page 321 305 \"Have you seen a girl in a black cowboy hat?\" she asked in a staccato German accent. \"Hang out with us,\" I said. \"We're more fun than your friends.\"",
  "141": "It was a line I'd learned from David DeAngelo. And it worked. My friends looked on in shock as she sat down and asked for a cigarette. For the rest of the night, the Amazon and I talked. Every now and then, she'd drag me to the bathroom, where I'd watch her inhale cocaine like a human Dustbuster. \"Do you watch Sex in the City?\" she asked as we left the bathroom for the third time that night. \"Sometimes,\" I told her. \"I just got a pearl,\" she said, with Teutonic pride. \"That's great.\" I had no idea what a pearl was. \"It's cool,\" she said. \"With those little beads.\" \"Oh, the beads. Those things are great.\" I was totally confused. But I liked listening to her, enjoying the mis\u00ad match between her harsh accent and her spongy lips. Maybe she was talking about anal beads. Good for her. I stopped and leaned against the wall of the corridor we were walking through. \"How good of a kisser are you, on a scale of one to ten?\" \"I'm a ten,\" she said. \"I like soft, slow, teasing kisses. I hate it when someone rams their tongue down my throat.\" \"Yeah, I had a girlfriend who did that. It was like making out with a cow.\" \"I give amazing blow jobs,\" she said. \"Respect.\" That one-word answer had taken me months to figure out. Some women like to make extremely sexual comments after meeting a man. It is a shit test. If the guy becomes uncomfortable, he fails; however, if he takes the bait and gets excited or says something sexual in response, he also fails. Af\u00ad ter watching the British television character Ali G, I discovered the solution: Just look her in the eye, nod approvingly, and, with a slight smile creeping across your face, say, \"Respect,\" in a smart-ass tone. I had responses now for nearly every challenge a woman could throw my way. But this was hardly a challenge\u2014it was fool's mate. My job was simply to not do anything wrong. I fell silent and did what the PUAs call triangular gazing, looking slowly from her left eye to her right eye and then to her lips to create suggestive sexual tension. Page 322 3DG She threw herself against me. The next thing she did was ram her tongue down my throat, like a cow. Then she pulled away. \"Talking about kissing got me excited,\" she said. \"Let's get out of here,\" I replied, peeling myself off the wall. We took the elevator downstairs and hailed a cab. She gave the driver an address in the East Village. I guess we were going to her place. She straddled me in the back seat and pulled a heavy breast out of her tank top. I guess I was supposed to suck it. We arrived at her house and climbed the stairs to her apartment. She turned on a lamp, which cast a dull brown glow over the room, and slipped the Rolling Stones' Goats Head Soup into her stereo. \"I'm just going to put my pearl on,\" she told me. \"I can't wait,\" I said. And I couldn't. As I lay there, I realized I'd forgotten to say good-bye to my friends. In fact, I'd ignored them all night. Sarging had dropped a polyester curtain be\u00ad tween me and my past. But when my new friend emerged in her pearl, I de\u00ad cided, in the heat of the moment, that it was worth it. The pearl wasn't anal beads at all. It was a pair of panties with an exposed crotch and a chain of small metal balls connecting the front side to the back, running over her pussy. She'd probably left the house that night hoping to find someone to take home to show it off to. Obliging, I rubbed the balls gently against her labia and her clit. I figured that was what it was for, though I wasn't really sure because, a minute later, the chain of balls snapped off the underwear. It dangled between her legs like a tampon string. So much for her new pearl. \"I'm going to change,\" she said. She didn't seem upset. Inhaling an eight ball of cocaine will do that to someone. She re-emerged in knee-high black leather boots, lay down on the bed, and took another Dustbuster snort from a burgundy vial of coke. Then she lifted the vial over her chest and tapped a small pile of powder onto the crest of her left breast.",
  "142": "I'm not a fan of drugs. Part of being a PUA is learning to control your own state, so you don't need alcohol or drugs to have a good time. But if I were ever going to do cocaine, now would be the time. Every woman is different in bed. Each has her own tastes and quirks and fantasies. And someone's surface appearance never accurately indicates Page 323 307 the raging storm or dead calm that lies beneath. Reaching that moment of passionate truth\u2014of surrender, honesty, revelation\u2014was my favorite part of the game. I loved seeing what new person emerged in bed, and then talking with that new person after our mutual orgasms. I guess I just like people. I leaned over her breast and plugged my left nostril. I was really dread\u00ad ing this: I didn't want to be up all night, and I had a feeling that coke wasn't good for a gentleman's staying power. Not that I was a gentleman. And then the phone rang. My phone. \"I have to get this,\" I told her. I jumped up, spilling fairy dust all over the sheets, and grabbed my cell phone. I had a feeling I knew who was calling. \"Hey, can you come over?\" It was Courtney Love. \"See if you can get some acupuncture needles in Chinatown\u2014the big ones that hurt the most. And get some alcohol and cotton swabs.\" Page 324 \"This one's for the gallbladder,\" Courtney Love said as she slammed an acu\u00ad puncture needle into my leg. \"Um, shouldn't this be done by a licensed professional?\" \"I've been doing this since I was young,\" she replied, \"but you're the first person I've done it to in a while.\" She wiggled the needle around. \"Tell me when you feel it.\" There. An electric shock to the leg. Okay. Enough. My scheduled one-hour interview with Courtney Love had turned into a surreal slumber party. Outside of food runs, I didn't leave her Chinatown loft for seventy-two hours. It was five thousand square feet with nothing in it but a bed, a television, and a couch. Dressed down in a T-shirt and sweatpants, she was in hiding: from the paparazzi, from her manager, from the government, from the bank, from a man, from herself. I was stripped down to my boxers on her couch, with a dozen needles sticking out of me. Over time the floor around her bed grew dense with crumbs, cigarette butts, clothing, food wrappers, needles, and root beer bottles; meanwhile, the color of her fingers and toes changed from flesh to blackened ash. She was too scared even to answer her phone, in case someone called her \"with some bullshit news about some fucking thing.\" It was just the two of us: journalist and rock star, player and playette. She put Boogie Nights into her DVD player, then climbed into her bed and threw a stained blanket over herself. \"I always ask the guy I'm dating, 'What's your biggest fear?'\" she said. \"My last boyfriend said it's drifting, which he's doing now. The video director I'm currently obsessed with said failure. And I'm living mine: It's loss of power.\" Of all the problems in Courtney's life, the one that seemed to consume her most was romantic. The video director wasn't returning her calls. It was a problem common to all women, no matter what they looked like or how famous they were. \"I have a theory,\" she said. \"You have to sleep with a guy three times for Page 325 309 him to fall in love with you. And I only slept with him twice. I need one more night to get him.\" This director had captured her heart by playing push-pull. He'd walk her home, make out with her, and then tell her he couldn't come inside. Whether by accident or design, he was following David DeAngelo's tech\u00ad nique of two steps forward and one step back. \"If you want to get him,\" I said, \"read The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene. It'll give you some strategy.\" She stubbed her cigarette out on the floor. \"I need all the help I can get.\" The Art of Seduction was classic PUA reading material, along with Greene's other book, The 48 Laws of Power. For the former, Greene studied the greatest seductions of history and literature in search of common themes. His",
  "143": "book classified different types of seducers (among them rakes, ideal lovers, and naturals); targets (drama queens, rescuers, crushed stars); and techniques, all of which jibed with community philosophy (approach indirectly, send mixed signals, appear to be an object of desire, isolate the victim). \"How do you know about that book?\" she asked. \"I've spent the last year and a half hanging out with the world's greatest pickup artists.\" She sat up in her bed. \"Tell me, tell me, tell me,\" she squealed like a schoolgirl. Talking about pickup was better than the alternative: Whenever the discussion veered toward her legal, media, and custody problems, her eyes filled with tears. She listened rapt as I told her about the community and Project Holly\u00ad wood. It wasn't easy to have a serious conversation with a dozen acupunc\u00ad ture needles sticking out of my body. \"I want to meet them,\" she said excitedly. \"Do you think they're as good as Warren Beatty?\" \"I don't know. I've never met him.\" Courtney climbed out of bed and rubbed patchouli oil around the nee\u00ad dles in my feet, legs, and chest. \"Let me tell you, he's smooth.\" \"I would love to know how he operates.\" \"He's great. He once called me and said, 'Hey, it's me,' as if I should have known who it was. Then he tried to convince me to come over to his house that night. When I finally say yes, he laughed and said he was in Paris. It's a total mindfuck. He'll blow his nose and then hand the dirty tissue to his date.\" Page 326 310 It was a neg. Warren Beatty negged women. Every PUA\u2014whether he's aware of it or not\u2014uses the same principles. The difference between those in the community and lone wolves like Warren Beatty (when he was single), Brett Ratner, and David Blaine is that we name our techniques and share our information. \"I don't know what this director's problem is,\" Courtney was saying. \"I have a magic pussy. If you fuck me, you become a king. I'm a kingmaker.\" (Translation: If you fuck her, you become famous.) She began pulling the needles out of my body. Relief. \"You have to get one in your head. It's the best feeling.\" Fumbling around the floor, Courtney grabbed a dirty needle. She aimed it just above my eye. \"No thanks. I've had enough for today.\" \"You gotta try it. It's great for the liver.\" \"My liver's fine, thanks.\" She dropped the needle back to the floor. \"Fine. I'm going out to get some Rice Krispie Treats then.\" She wriggled out of her pink shirt and stood in front of me topless. \"These are natural breasts but with a silicone lift,\" she said, hovering over me and revealing a scar underneath her left mammary. \"Do you know how much a shot of my tits is worth? Nine thousand dollars.\" \"Then your problems are solved,\" I suggested. \"That won't even get me in the door at the lawyer's office,\" she snapped, slipping into a black-and-white baby-doll dress. When she returned from the store, she was flushed with excitement. She pulled a coffee cake out of her bag and split it in half, leaving a trail of crumbs behind her as she made for the safety of her bed. \"Let's make a bet,\" she said. \"What?\" \"I will bet you that I can get this director back.\" \"I doubt you can. If he's not returning your calls, he's not interested.\" \"He even denied he'd slept with me in the Post.\" She handed me half of the coffee cake in her blackened fingers. \"But I like a challenge.\" \"Well, if you can get him back, you're a better pickup artist than I am.\" \"Then let's bet,\" she insisted. \"What are the stakes?\" \"If I can't get him back, I will give you a one-week stand with me\u2014 wherever you want.\" Page 327 311 I looked at her blankly. I was so taken aback by the notion that I had trouble processing the words. \"Or you can pick the middle name of my next child. It's your choice.\" \"Okay.\" \"But I have one condition: I get an hour of advice with each pickup artist you're living with.\" When it came time for me to leave and catch my plane, Courtney climbed out of bed and kissed me good-bye. \"I just need to be fucked,\"",
  "144": "she said as I waited for the elevator that would take me out of her loft. \"I just need a bossy guy to come here and fuck me.\" I knew I could have been that guy. The IOIs were there. But there's a PUA's code of honor, there's a gambler's code of honor, and there's a jour- nalist's code of honor. And having sex with her would have been violating all three. What I had told Dustin that morning in my apartment really was true: Learning pickup had enriched so much more than just my sex life. The skills I had amassed in the community made me a much better interviewer than I'd ever been. I discovered just how good when I was assigned an inter\u00ad view with Britney Spears. Page 328 Was there a lot of pressure on you while making this album? What, now? Was there a lot of pressure from yourself or the label to have a major hit this time around? I have no idea. You have no idea? I have no idea. I heard you did a track with the DFA that wasn't included on your new CD. Why was that? What's the DFA? They're two producers from New York, James Murphy and Tim Goldsworthy, who call themselves the DFA. Does that ring a bell? Yeah, maybe they did something. My interview with Britney Spears was going nowhere. I looked at her, cross\u00ad ing her legs and fidgeting on the hotel-room couch next to me. She didn't give a shit. I was just an amount of time blocked off on her calendar, and she was tolerating it\u2014poorly. Her hair was tucked under a white Kangol hat and her thighs pushed at the seams of her faded blue jeans. She was one of the most desired women in the world. But in person, she looked like a cornfed Southern sorority girl. She had a beautiful face, lightly and perfectly touched with makeup, but there was something masculine about her. As a sexual icon, she was unin- timidating and, I imagined, lonely. A gear slammed down in my head. There was only one way to save this interview: I had to sarge her. No matter what country I was in or what age or class or race of woman I was Page 329 313 talking to, the game always worked. Besides, I had nothing to lose by gam\u00ad ing Britney Spears. The interview couldn't get any more boring. Maybe I'd even get a decent quote I could actually print. I folded my list of questions and put them in my back pocket. I had to treat her like any club girl with attention deficit disorder. The first move was to hook her attention. \"I'll tell you something about yourself that other people probably don't know,\" I began. \"People sometimes see you as shy or bitchy offstage, even though you aren't.\" \"Totally,\" she said. \"Do you want to know why?\" \"Yeah.\" I was creating what's called a yes-ladder, capturing her atten\u00ad tion by asking questions that require an obvious affirmative answer. \"I'm watching your eyes when you talk. And every time you think, they go down and to the left. That means you're a kinesthetic person. You're someone who lives in her feelings.\" \"Oh my God,\" she said. \"That's totally true.\" Of course it was. It was one of the value-demonstrating routines I'd de\u00ad veloped. The eye goes to one of seven different positions when someone thinks: Each position means the person is accessing a different part of their brain. As I taught her how to read different types of eye movements, she clung to every word. Her legs uncrossed and she leaned in toward me. The game was on. \"I didn't know this,\" she said. \"Who told you this?\" I wanted to tell her, \"A secret society of international pickup artists.\" \"It's something I observed from doing lots of interviews,\" I answered. \"In fact, by watching the direction peoples' eyes move when they speak, you can tell whether they're telling the truth or not.\" \"So you're going to know if l'm lying?\" She was looking at me entirely differently now. I wasn't a journalist anymore. I was someone she could learn from, someone who offered value. I had demonstrated authority over her world. \"I can tell from your eye movements, from your eye contact, from the way you speak, and from your body language.",
  "145": "There are many different ways to tell.\" \"I need to do psychology classes,\" she said, with endearing earnestness. Page 330 314 \"That would be so interesting to me, studying people.\" It was working. She was opening up. She kept talking and talking: \"And you could meet some\u00ad body or be out on a date and be like, 'Are they lying to me right now?' Oh my gosh.\" It was time to pull out the heavy artillery. \"I'll show you something really cool and then we'll get back to the in\u00ad terview,\" I said, throwing in a time constraint for good measure. \"It'll be an experiment. I'm going to try to guess something that's in your thoughts.\" Then I used a simple psychological gambit to guess the initials of an old friend she had an emotional connection to\u2014someone I wouldn't know and hadn't heard of. The initials were G. C. And I got one letter out of two cor\u00ad rect. It was a new routine I was still learning, but it was good enough for her. \"I can't believe you did that! I probably have so many walls in front, so that's why you didn't get them both,\" she said. \"Let's try it one more time.\" \"This time, why don't you try it?\" \"I'm scared.\" She put her knuckle in her mouth and pinched the skin between her teeth. She had great teeth. They really were a perfect C-shape. \"I can't do that.\" She was no longer Britney Spears. She was just a one-set, a lone target. Or, as Robert Greene would classify her in his breakdown of seducer's vic\u00ad tims, she was the lonely leader. \"We'll make it easier,\" I said. \"I'm going to write down a number. And it's a number between one and ten. What I want you to do is not to think at all. You need to trust your instincts. There's no special ability required to read minds. Just quiet your internal chatter and really listen to your feelings.\" I wrote a number on a piece of paper and handed it to her face down. \"Now, tell me,\" I said, \"the first number that you feel.\" \"What if it's wrong?\" she asked. \"It's probably wrong.\" This was what we called in the field an LSE girl\u2014she had low self-esteem. \"What do you think it is?\" \"Seven,\" she said. \"Now, turn over the paper,\" I told her. She slowly turned it over, as if she were afraid to look, then moved it up to eye level and saw a big number seven staring right back at her. She screamed, leaped off the couch, and ran to the hotel mirror. Her mouth hung agape as she looked her reflection in the eye. \"Oh my God,\" she said to her reflection. \"I did that.\" Page 331 315 It was as if she had to look at herself in the mirror to make sure that what had just happened was real. \"Whoa,\" she gasped. \"I did that.\" She was like a little girl seeing Britney Spears for the first time. She was her own fan. \"I just knew that it was seven!\" she announced as she galloped back to the couch. Of course she knew. That was the first magic trick I learned from Mystery: If you have someone chose a number between one and ten ran\u00ad domly, seventy percent of the time\u2014especially if you rush their decision\u2014 that number will be seven. So, yeah, I had tricked her. But her self-esteem needed a good boost. \"See,\" I told her. \"You already know all the answers inside. It's just that society trains you to think too much.\" I really believed that. \"Cool interview!\" she exclaimed. \"I like this interview! This has been the best interview of my life!\" Then she turned her face toward mine, looked me in the eye, and asked, \"Can we stop the tape recorder?\" For the next fifteen minutes, we talked about spirituality and writing and our lives. She was just a lost little girl going through a late emotional puberty. She was searching for something real to hold onto, something deeper than pop fame and the sycophancy of her handlers. I had demon\u00ad strated value, and now we were moving on to the rapport phase of seduc\u00ad tion. Maybe Mystery was right: All human relationships follow the same formula. Rapport equals trust plus comfort. However, I had a job to do. I started the tape recorder and asked the questions I'd given her at the start of",
  "146": "the interview, plus all the other ques\u00ad tions I had. This time she gave me real answers, answers I could print. When the hour was up, I stopped the tape recorder. \"You know,\" Britney said. \"Everything happens for a reason.\" \"I truly believe that,\" I told her. \"I do too.\" She touched my shoulder and a broad smile spread across her face. \"I'd like to exchange numbers.\" Page 332 After our hour was up, Britney left the room to change for an MTV inter\u00ad view. She returned ten minutes later with her publicist. As she sat down in front of the cameras, her publicist looked at me strangely. \"You know, she's never done that with a writer before,\" she said. \"Really?\" I asked. \" She said it was like the two of you were destined to meet.\" The publicist and I stood next to each other in silence as the MTV in\u00ad terview began. \"So you had a crazy time out the other night,\" the interviewer asked. \"Yeah, I did,\" Britney answered. \"What was the energy level like in the club when you walked in and sur\u00ad prised everyone?\" \"Oh, it was just crazy.\" \"And how much fun did you have?\" Suddenly, Britney stood up. \"This isn't working,\" she told the crew. \"I'm not feeling this.\" She pivoted on her heels and walked toward the door, leaving the crew and her assistants befuddled. As she passed me, the corners of her mouth turned upward, forming a conspiratorial smile. I had gotten to her. There was something deeper to Britney Spears than what the pop machine re\u00ad quired of her. The game, I realized, works better on celebrities than ordinary people. Because stars are so sheltered and their interactions limited, a demonstra\u00ad tion of value or the right neg holds ten times the power. In the days that followed, I thought often about what had happened. I had no illusions: Britney Spears wasn't attracted to me. She wasn't consid\u00ad ering me as a potential mate. But I had interested her. And that was a step in the right direction. Pickup is a linear process: Capture the imagination first and the heart next. Interest plus attraction plus seduction equals sex. Page 333 317 Of course, maybe this was all just self-hypnosis. For all I knew, she ex\u00ad changed phone numbers with every journalist to make him feel special and ensure a good story. She probably had an answering service set up at that number specifically for gullible writers who thought they were pickup artists. Or perhaps it was a scheme of the publicist's to make journalists think they had a special connection with her artist. Maybe I was the one be\u00ad ing sarged, not her. I would never know the truth. I stared at that number every day, but I couldn't bring myself to dial it. I told myself that it was crossing a journalistic line: If she didn't like the piece I was writing (which was quite possible), I didn't want her to go on record saying I had written a bad article because she hadn't phoned back. \"Just call her,\" Mystery constantly prodded me. \"What do you have to lose? Tell her, 'Can you not look like Britney Spears? We're going to do some crazy shit, and we can't get caught. We're going to wear wigs, climb up to the Hollywood sign, and touch it for good luck.'\" \"If I had met her socially, fine. But this is a work assignment.\" \"You're playing the game at another level now. When the article is fin\u00ad ished, it isn't an assignment anymore. So call her.\" But I couldn't do it. If it had been Dalene Kurtis, the Playmate of the Year, I would have called her back in a second. I had no fear of women like that anymore. I felt worthy. I'd proven that over and over since meeting her. But Britney Spears? One's self-esteem can only grow so much in a year and a half. Page 335 STEP 9 MAKE A PHYSICAL CONNECTION Page 336 AND DO YOU THINK THAT LOVE ITSELF, LIVING IN SUCH AN UGLY HOUSE, CAN PROSPER LONG? _EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAY, \"And do you think that love itself \" Page 337 It took just one woman to bring Project Hollywood down. By all appearances, Katya was a standard-issue party girl. She liked to drink, dance, have sex, and get",
  "147": "high, not necessarily in that order. But Katya\u2014perhaps out of innocence, perhaps out of revenge, perhaps out of true love\u2014would outgame every PUA in the house. All those years of study, all those memorized routines and learned patterns of behavior, all those New Rock platform boots were no match for a woman scorned. When I returned from New York, Mystery had a workshop scheduled in Los Angeles. He was charging fifteen hundred dollars now\u2014and people were paying. He had five students, guaranteeing a healthy profit for a week\u00ad end of talking and sarging. Katya's was just one of several numbers he had collected while demonstrating his game during the workshop. He'd met her at a Hollywood bar called Star Shoes. She was very drunk at the time, and quite possibly high. Monday was telephone day at Project Hollywood. Everyone called the numbers they'd collected the previous weekend to see which leads were hot and which had staled. When Mystery made his calls, the only person who picked up the phone was Katya. If Katya hadn't been home and another one of Mystery's numbers had answered instead, all our lives would have been different. Despite our supposed skill, mating is largely a game of chance. Women are at different places in their lives when we meet them. They may be look\u00ad ing for a boyfriend, a one-night stand, a husband, or a revenge fuck. Or they may be looking for nothing at all, because they're in a happy relationship or recovering from an emotionally destructive one. Katya was probably looking for a place to live. When Mystery called, Katya couldn't remember having met him. Nonetheless, after a half hour of talk (or comfort-building, as Mystery put it), she agreed to come over. \"Dress casual,\" Mystery told her. \"I'll only be able to hang out for an hour or two.\" Page 338 322 Using words like \"casual\" and \"hang out,\" and the time constraint, were all part of a strategy to make the visit a low-pressure event. It's a much better way to get someone to commit to time with a stranger than AFC-style dinner dating, which can be a painful, drawn-out affair that involves two people who may have nothing in common stuck together for an entire night of awkward conversation. Katya arrived that evening wearing a pink sweatsuit and dragging along a scrappy little terrier named Lily. Both Katya and Lily instantly made themselves at home. The former collapsed into the pillow pit and the latter took a shit on the carpet. Mystery popped out of his room in jeans, a long-sleeved black T-shirt, and his hair in a pony tail. \"I'm just going to hook my computer up to the projector and show you some movies I made,\" he told her. \"No worries, no troubles,\" Katya replied in an upbeat Russian accent. She had a button nose that wiggled, puffy cheeks that flared, and blonde hair that bounced to maximize her cuteness. Mystery dimmed the lights and showed her our home movies. They were becoming a popular routine around the house because they allowed us to convey positive qualities about ourselves and our friends without even talking. After movie time, Mystery and Katya massaged each other and made out. On their second meeting, three days later, after much LMR, they closed the deal. \"I'm moving out of my apartment,\" she told Mystery afterward. \"So is it okay if Lily stays here while I go to Las Vegas this weekend?\" Leaving Lily at the house was a cunning tactic because, while Katya was gone, we all grew attached to the cheery, lovable dog\u2014and, by extension, to its owner as well. Their personalities were similar: They were both bouncy and energetic and liked licking Mystery's face. When Katya returned from Las Vegas, Mystery helped her move out of her old house. \"I think it's completely ridiculous for you to rent a new apartment, knowing that you'll be spending most of your time with me,\" he told her. \"So why don't you just move into my room?\" All she had to her name were two duffel bags, a makeup kit, Lily, and a Mazda SUV stuffed with clothing and shoes. As",
  "148": "far as anyone knew, she had no job or source of income, though she'd modeled for a couple of low-bud\u00ad get swimsuit calendars. In the evenings, she went to school to learn special- effects makeup. Every night after class she'd prance around the house with Page 339 323 fake rope burns around her neck or artificial brain spilling out of a flesh wound in her forehead or the wrinkles and liver spots of a ninety-year-old woman. Katya quickly wove herself into the fabric of the house. She volunteered to be a pivot for Papa's workshops; she put eyeliner on Herbal before he went out for the night; she cleaned the kitchen that we were all too lazy to deal with ourselves; she went shopping with Xaneus; and she played hostess to Playboy's parties. She had an amazing ability to befriend anyone, though her motivation was unclear: Maybe she was genuinely a people-loving per\u00ad son, maybe she enjoyed the free rent. Either way, she was giving the home its first rays of warmth and camaraderie since the night we'd moved in and sat in the Jacuzzi, dreaming of the future together. I liked her. We all liked her. We even let her brother, a shaggy-haired sixteen-year-old with Tourette's syndrome, sleep in the pillow pit for a few weeks. Mystery was particularly happy with himself. He hadn't dated anyone seriously since Patricia. \"I actually have a crush on my own girlfriend,\" he said with pride one eve\u00ad ning, showing Katya's swimsuit-calendar picture to a group of random sarg- ers. \"I think of her constantly, like when you have a baby. I have a very strong nurturing instinct. I need to take care of this girl and make sure she's safe.\" Later that night, as Herbal cooked steak on the barbecue, Katya and I sat in the Jacuzzi, sharing a bottle of wine. \"I'm really scared,\" she said. \"Why?\" I asked, though I really knew why. \"I'm starting to fall in love with Mystery.\" \"Well, he's a talented and amazing guy.\" \"Yeah,\" she said. \"I never let myself fall in love like this. I don't know enough about him yet. I'm worried.\" Then she sat there quietly. She wanted me to say something, to warn her if she was making a mistake. I didn't say anything. A few days later, Mystery, Katya, and I flew to Las Vegas. As we changed to go out for the night, he rattled on about his favorite subject. \"I am so into this girl.\" He smudged on black eyeliner and smeared white concealer beneath his eyes. \"She's even bi. She has a couple she sleeps with in New Or\u00ad leans.\" He centered a black cowboy hat he had bought in Australia on his head and admired himself in the mirror. \"I feel like I'm pairbonding.\" Page 340 324 We had dinner at Mr. Lucky's at the Hard Rock Casino, where Katya put away two glasses of champagne; then crossed the street to Club Par\u00ad adise, a strip club, where she put away two more glasses of champagne. When the waitress came to the table, Katya commented to Mystery, \"She's really hot.\" Mystery looked the waitress over. She was a perky Latina with long black hair that reflected the stage lights and a densely packed body that threatened to burst through her clothing. \"Ever seen the movie Poltergeist?\" Mystery asked her. He made her straw move. He told her they wouldn't get along. He asked her what she was fa\u00ad mous for\u2014\"everybody's famous for something.\" Soon the waitress was stopping by our table every few minutes to flirt with Mystery. \"I would love to see that girl,\" Mystery told Katya, \"eating you out.\" \"You just want to fuck her,\" Katya slurred. I suppose it was difficult for any woman\u2014especially a drunk one\u2014to see the same routines that had en\u00ad snared her being used on another woman. And effectively. Katya leapt to her feet and stormed to the bar. Mystery followed to ap\u00ad pease her. But when she refused to acknowledge him, he stomped out of the club like an angry child. Although Katya was bisexual, Mystery still wasn't getting threesomes. He made the same mistake every time: He pushed too hard. He needed to follow Rick H.'s advice and make the experience her fan\u00ad",
  "149": "tasy, not his. When I woke up, I took a plane home, leaving the two of them alone in the hotel room until their flight in the evening. A few hours later, I received a phone call: \"Hey, it's Katya.\" \"Hey. Is something wrong?\" \"No. Mystery wants to marry me. He got down on his knees at the Hard Rock pool and proposed. Everyone applauded. It was so sweet. What should I do?\" The only reason I could come up with to explain Mystery's desire to get married was so he could get a U.S. citizenship. But Katya wasn't a U.S. citi\u00ad zen. She still had a Russian passport. \"Don't rush into anything,\" I advised. \"Just get engaged. Or, if you want, they have commitment ceremonies at the chapels there. Do that. Then spend some more time together and see if this is something you both really want to do.\" Mystery grabbed the phone. \"Hey, man, you're going to get really mad at me. We're getting married. I love this girl. She's crazy. We're on our way to the chapel. Okay, bye.\" Page 341 325 The guy was an idiot. That evening, Mystery carried Katya over the threshold of Project Hol\u00ad lywood humming \"Here Comes the Bride.\" They'd known each other for three weeks. \"Look at my ring,\" Katya cooed. \"Isn't it beautiful?\" \"Our rings cost eight thousand dollars,\" Mystery said with pride. That was basically all the cash he had. Though he was raking in money from his workshops, he was a fan of man toys\u2014computers, digital cameras, elec\u00ad tronic organizers, basically anything with a chip. \"This whole marriage thing,\" Mystery told me while Katya was in the bathroom, \"is the best routine ever. She loves me now. She gets off on call\u00ad ing me her husband. It's like a time distortion.\" \"Dude, it's the worst routine ever,\" I replied, \"because you can only do it once.\" Mystery took a step toward me and removed his ring. \"I'm going to tell you a secret,\" he whispered, putting the ring in my hand. \"We're not really married.\" If any other PUA had told me he'd gotten married in Vegas to a girl he'd just met, I would have known it was a joke. But Mystery was so headstrong and unpredictable that I had given him the benefit\u2014or, more accurately, the detriment\u2014of the doubt. \"Yeah, after you left, we walked by a jewelry store in the Hard Rock and decided to fake our marriage. So I bought two rings for a hundred bucks. She's such a good liar. She totally fooled you.\" \"You're both great illusionists.\" \"Don't tell Katya I told you. I think she's really enjoying the role-play. On an emotional level, it's the same as really being married for her.\" Mystery was right: Perception is reality. In the days that followed, their entire relationship changed. They actually started acting like an old mar\u00ad ried couple. Now that he was living with a woman, Mystery didn't feel the need to go out anymore. To him, clubs were for sarging. To Katya, though, they were for dancing. So she started going clubbing without him. After a while, Mystery hardly left his room or, for that matter, his bed. It was hard to tell whether he was just being lazy, or if a depression was coming on. There's a pattern the pickup artists have called rocks versus gold. It's a speech a man gives a woman he's dating when she stops having sex with him. He tells her that women in a relationship want rocks (or diamonds) Page 342 326 while men seek gold. Rocks, for a woman, are wonderful nights out, roman\u00ad tic attention, and emotional connection. Gold for a man is sex. If you give a woman only gold or a man just rocks, neither will be satisfied. There must be an exchange. And Katya was giving Mystery the gold, but he wasn't giv\u00ad ing her the rocks. He wasn't taking her out at all. It wasn't long before they began to resent each other. He'd say, \"She gets drunk every night. It's driving me crazy.\" She'd say, \"When I met him, he had all these plans and ambitions. Now he never leaves his bed. What's the point?\" He'd say, \"She never shuts up. She's constantly yapping about some\u00ad thing pointless and bouncing off the walls.\" She'd say, \"I'm",
  "150": "getting wasted every night because I don't want to be in a reality that's so sad.\" Mystery needed a more passive girl. Katya needed a more active man. And it saddened the rest of us; after living in a house full of men for so many months, we'd grown attached to her positive energy and high spirits. Mystery had taught himself everything there was to know about pickup, but nothing about how to maintain a relationship. He had this beautiful creature, full of sparkle and life, and he was just throwing it away. Soon, another woman, with a very different kind of sparkle, would move into Project Hollywood. I received the text message at 11:39 PM: \"Can I stay at yr house? They repoed the car and worse. U don't wanna know. Need to not be alone.\" It was Courtney Love. Page 343 I knocked on the door of Courtney's corporate apartment in West Los An\u00ad geles. \"Come in. It's open.\" Courtney sat on the floor in the middle of a sea of American Express bills and bank statements with a yellow highlighter in her hand. She wore a black Marc Jacobs dress with buttons running down the side. One was missing \"I can't look at these anymore,\" she moaned. \"There are so many loans here that I never knew of or approved.\" She stood up and slammed an American Express bill on the table. Half the items were highlighted, with notes in black ink scribbled in the mar\u00ad gins. \"If I stay here, I'll do drugs again,\" she cried. She didn't have a manager, and taking care of her own affairs was prov\u00ad ing to be more than she could handle. \"I don't want to be alone,\" she begged. \"I need somewhere to stay for a couple days. Then I'll be out of your hair. I promise.\" \"That's fine.\" I guess she didn't have a problem with the story I'd writ\u00ad ten in Rolling Stone. \"Herbal said you could sleep in his room. I just want to warn you, though, that you're not going into an ordinary house.\" \"I know. I want to meet the pickup artists. Maybe they can help me.\" I walked her downstairs and strapped her sixty-pound suitcase to the luggage rack on the back of my Corvette. \"You should also know that Katya's brother is staying with us,\" I said. \"And if he seems a little off, it's because he has Tourette's.\" \"Is that like when you yell 'Shit! Balls!' uncontrollably?\" \"Yeah. It's sort of like that.\" I parked in the garage and dragged her suitcase upstairs to the house. The first person we saw inside was Herbal, who was coming out of the kitchen. \"Hi shit balls,\" Courtney said to him. \"No,\" I told her. \"That's not Katya's brother.\" Page 344 3ZB Her brother walked out of the kitchen a moment later, sipping a Coke. \"Hi shit balls,\" Courtney said to him. She took a step backward and stepped on Lily, who yelped loudly. Courtney turned around. I assumed she was going to apologize. \"Fuck off,\" she told the dog. This was going to be an interesting couple of days. I showed her around the house and then bid her goodnight. Two min\u00ad utes later, she marched into my room. \"I need a toothbrush,\" she said as she breezed through to my bathroom. \"There's a clean one in the medicine cabinet,\" I yelled after her. \"This will do,\" she snapped back, grabbing my gnarly used toothbrush off the sink. There was something endearing about her. She possessed a trait nearly every pickup artist desired but lacked: She just didn't give a fuck. The next morning, I came downstairs to find her in the living room, smoking a cigarette and wearing nothing but a pair of expensive Japanese silk panties. Her body was covered with black marks, as if she'd been rolling around in charcoal. In that state of dishabille, she met the rest of the house. \"I used to ride horses with your dad,\" Papa told her when I intro\u00ad duced them. Courtney scowled. \"If you call that man my father again, I'll punch you in the face!\" She wasn't trying to be mean\u2014she just lived in and reacted to the moment\u2014but Papa didn't take well to aggression. All Papa had wanted from the day he'd signed the lease to Project Hollywood was to hang out with celebrities. But now",
  "151": "that he was living with one\u2014in fact, the most no\u00ad torious woman in the country at the time\u2014he was petrified of her. He avoided her from that day forward, like he did everyone else who wasn't part of his pickup business. Next, Courtney met Katya. \"I just took a pregnancy test,\" Katya told her, puckering her lips into a childish expression of self-pity. \"It came out positive.\" \"You should have the baby,\" Courtney said. \"It's the most beautiful thing in the world.\" I was living The Surreal Life. Page 345 Mystery kneeled in front of Katya and kissed her belly. \"If you want to keep the baby, whether we are together forever or not, I will support your deci\u00ad sion. It would be a beautiful baby.\" The sun poured into the kitchen from the patio, illuminating a thin, orderly chain of ants that ran from the brickwork outside to the overflow\u00ad ing trashcan. Before he stood up, Mystery licked his finger and wiped a thin stripe of saliva through the middle of the chain. The ants went scurrying in every direction at the point of rupture. \"I can't even believe you'd think of keeping the baby,\" Katya replied, her voice chirpy but scornful. \"You are weird. You're acting like we're married.\" The ants began to fall back into line. Soon, order was restored. It was hard to tell there had ever been a catastrophe. \"I love you,\" Mystery said, without emotion. \"And you know my mis\u00ad sion in life: survive and replicate. So I don't see any harm in having the baby. I'm willing to fulfill my half of the obligation.\" Our house wasn't self-organizing like a line of ants. There was no chain of command or unspoken structure. The invisible chemical path we were all following smelled like male hormones. And its natural state was disorder. All afternoon, Mystery and Katya fought with each other over whether she should have an abortion and who should pay for it. These matters, how\u00ad ever, are not group decisions. Katya and Mystery went to an abortion clinic three days later. \"Guess what?\" Katya squealed when she returned. \"I'm not pregnant.\" She jumped into the air and clapped her hands together in praise of luck. Mystery stood behind her, giving her the finger. The look on his face was pure hatred. I'd never seen him display such malevolence toward a woman before. A few hours later, I found Katya at the bar pouring herself a glass of Chardonnay. Then another. Then another. \"Mystery doesn't come out of the room, and he doesn't fuck,\" she com\u00ad plained. \"So I'm going to have a good time tonight without him.\" Page 346 33D \"You deserve it.\" \"Come drink with me,\" she cooed. \"That's all right.\" \"No worries, no troubles.\" She took a slow sip of wine and sat next to me on the couch. \"Wow,\" she said. \"You really have been working out. Your arms look good.\" \"Thanks.\" One of the things I'd learned in the past year and a half was how to take a compliment. Just say, \"Thank you.\" It's the only response a confident person can make. She sidled up to me and squeezed my biceps. \"You're the only person in the house I can talk to.\" Her face was inches away from mine. I felt that tingle of energy, the one I'd felt just before I kissed the host\u00ad ess Tyler Durden had picked up at the Hard Rock. \"Look at this,\" she said. She was lifting her top now. \"I got a scratch.\" \"That's nice.\" \"Here, feel it.\" She took my hand and pulled it toward her breast. I really had to get going. \"Well, it's been fun talking, but I have to go to my room and floss my cat now.\" \"But you don't have a cat,\" she whined. I circled around to the back of the house and entered Mystery's room through the patio. He was lying on top of his bed in jeans with a laptop computer resting on his bare stomach. He was watching Back to the Future II. \"When I was in tenth grade, I wanted to kill myself because I had noth\u00ad ing left to live for,\" he said. \" Then I heard that Back to the Future II was open\u00ad ing in twenty-three days. I had a calendar, and I would mark off each day until I could see the movie. It's the only thing that kept",
  "152": "me from killing my\u00ad self.\" He paused the movie and lifted the laptop off his stomach. \"When I saw it and heard the opening music, I cried, dude. It was my reason to live. I know all the props.\" He held up the DVD box and showed me the cover. \"I touched this car.\" I sat down at the foot of his bed. No one wants to be the bearer of bad news. I picked up the DVD box and looked at it. Mystery enjoyed movies Page 347 331 like Real Genius and Young Einstein and The Karate Kid. I liked Werner Herzog, Lars von Trier, and Pixar. It didn't mean I was better than him: It just meant we were different kinds of nerds. \"Dude,\" I told him, \"your wife is hitting on me.\" \"I'm not surprised. She hit on Playboy earlier tonight.\" \"Aren't you going to do anything about it?\" \"I don't care. She can do what she wants.\" \"Well, at least she's not pregnant.\" \"Get this,\" he said. \"She's such an idiot. That wasn't a pregnancy test at all. It was an ovulation test. She bought the wrong box at Rite Aid. She took the test three times and each one was positive. So all she discovered was that at twenty-three, she's still ovulating.\" \"Listen, man.\" I noticed that there were scratches on his arm. \"You're driving her away. If she's hitting on everyone in the house, it's only because she's trying to get revenge on you. It's rocks versus gold, man. You haven't been giving her rocks.\" \"Yeah. She's a brainless alcoholic.\" He paused, shut his eyes for a mo\u00ad ment, and nodded wistfully. \"But that body: Her ass is a 10.\" When I left Mystery's room, Katya was no longer in the living room. Papa's door was open, and she was cuddled next to him on his bed\u2014with her top off. I retreated to my room and waited. An hour later, the storm came. Voices yelled, doors slammed, glass smashed. There was a knock on my door. It was Courtney. \"Are your roommates always this loud?\" She was one to talk. I followed Courtney to Herbal's room. Herbal had been sleeping in the pillow pit while Courtney commandeered his room. Clothes, books, and cigarette ash were spread across the floor. A candle sat burning at the foot of the bed, its flame licking just an inch below the comforter. One of her dresses was draped over a hot, exposed light bulb for mood lighting. And all four of the house phone books were spread across her bed, with pages torn out of each. I examined the ripped scraps: They were listings for lawyers. The noises coming from Mystery's room grew louder. \"Let's see what's going on,\" she said. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want to clean up anyone's mess. This wasn't my fucking responsibility. Page 348 332 We walked into Mystery's bathroom. Katya was kneeling on the floor with her hands clasped around her neck, as if she were choking. Her brother was leaning over her, holding an asthma inhaler in her mouth. Mystery stood a few feet away, staring daggers at Katya. \"Should I call an ambulance?\" I asked. \"They'll arrest her because she has drugs in her system,\" Mystery said contemptuously. Katya looked up and glared at him. If she had the presence of mind to glare at Mystery, then she clearly wasn't dying. When Katya finally emerged from Mystery's room, her face red and damp, Courtney took her by the hand and led her to a sofa in the living room. She sat down next to her, still gripping her hand, and told her about the abortions she had been through and about the beauty of childbirth. I looked at the unlikely pair sitting there. Courtney was both Project Holly\u00ad wood's child and its mother. She was also probably the sanest person in the house. And that was a scary thought. Page 349 The next morning, Courtney burst out of her door at an atypically early hour. She was wearing an Agent Provocateur nightie. \"What? What's going on?\" she asked, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. \"I had a bad dream. I didn't know where I was.\" She looked around: at me, at Katya sleeping on the sofa, at Katya's brother and Herbal snoring inches apart in the pillow pit. \"Everyone's nice,\" she observed with",
  "153": "relief. \"No one's mean. Okay.\" She returned to her room and shut her door. A few minutes later, a driver arrived at the house. \"Where's Courtney?\" he asked. \"Sleeping,\" I said. \" She's got a court date in an hour.\" He knocked on her door and walked inside. Shortly afterward, a slew of dresses came tumbling out of Courtney's room, followed by their owner. \"I need to find something to wear to court,\" she said as she slipped on various outfits, running in and out of the bathroom to check them in the mirror. Eventually, she left the house in a strapless black cocktail dress of Katya's, Herbal's eight-dollar sunglasses, and Robert Greene's The 48 Laws of Power book tucked under her right arm. \"It's a silly dress because it's a silly case,\" she told court reporters that day. While she was gone, we inspected the damage. There were cigarette burns in Herbal's bedspread, and the wall behind the door was destroyed from the constant slamming. There were slicks of unidentifiable liquid on the floor, candles still burning, and clothing flung over every light fixture. In the kitchen, the refrigerator and cabinet doors all hung open. Two peanut butter jars and a jelly jar sat on the counter top, with their caps scat\u00ad tered on the floor. Globs of peanut butter dripped from the counter, the cabinets, and the refrigerator shelves. Rather than open bags of bread using the twist tie on the end, she had torn the tops of the plastic bags open like an animal. She didn't give a fuck. She was hungry; she ate. It was another quality that pickup artists admired: She could go caveman. When Courtney returned from court, she sat with the house's cabal of Page 350 334 pickup artists and planned her appearance that evening on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Mystery and Herbal taught her about concepts like social proof, and NLP ideas like framing. She needed to be reframed. The current frame everyone saw her through was that of a crazy woman. But having lived with her for two weeks, we knew she was just going through a bad pe\u00ad riod. She was eccentric, but not crazy. In fact, she was incredibly smart. She understood and internalized every concept they taught her. \"So my new frame, then, is that I'm a damsel in distress,\" she said. That evening, she shone on The Tonight Show. Unlike during her tabloid-headline-making Letterman appearance, she was composed and well-behaved on camera\u2014and her performance with her all-female band, the Chelsea, was a reminder that she wasn't just a celebrity, she was a rock star. I had driven to the show in Katya's car with Herbal, Mystery, Katya, and Kara, a girl I'd met in a bar a couple of days before. After the show, we went upstairs to Courtney's dressing room, where she was sitting on a stool surrounded by the Chelsea. I was stunned by her guitarist: She was a tall, gorgeous bleached-blonde rock-and-roller oozing attitude. Why couldn't I ever find girls like that in the clubs? \"Can I stay in your room for two more weeks?\" Courtney asked Herbal. \"Sure,\" he replied. Herbal never had a problem with anything or any\u00ad one. While Mystery had been moping in his room, he was out helping Katya keep her brother entertained. \"It may be a month,\" Courtney called after us as we left the room. In the parking lot, Mystery climbed into the driver's side of Katya's car. He hadn't spoken a word to her all day. She sat in the passenger seat and slipped a dance mix by Carl Cox into the CD player. Her musical taste was confined to house and techno; Mystery listened almost exclusively to Tool, Pearl Jam, and Live. That should have been a warning sign. As we pulled out of the parking lot, Mystery's phone rang. He turned the music off to answer it. Katya reached over and turned the music on quietly. Mystery angrily turned it off again. And so it went: on, off, on, off\u2014each twist of the knob with more venom than the last until, finally, Mystery slammed on the brakes, screamed \"fuck you,\" and jumped out of the car. He stood in the middle of Ventura",
  "154": "Boulevard blocking traffic, with his Page 351 335 right arm thrust out and a middle finger in the air, directly in line with Katya's face. Katya crawled into the driver's seat and drove to the intersection, then turned around to fetch Mystery, who had started walking along the sidewalk. When she pulled up next to him, he stopped, shot her a scornful look, crossed his arms into the fuck-you position, and then continued walking. She drove off without him. She wasn't angry; she was just disappointed by his childishness. That night, Mystery didn't return home. I called him several times, but he didn't answer. When I woke up the next morning, he still hadn't re\u00ad turned. Every time I dialed his number, the call went straight to voice mail. I began to worry. A few hours later, there was a knock on the door. I answered it, expect\u00ad ing Mystery, but found Courtney's driver standing there instead. One of Courtney's many talents was the ability to turn anyone within a hundred- yard radius into a personal assistant. Seduction students visiting the house for the first time found themselves running to Tokyopop for a manga book Courtney was in, picking up bedding from her corporate apartment, or sending e-mails to the financial expert Suze Orman. \"Shitballs!\" she called to Katya's brother. \"Can you go back to my apartment with the driver and get my DVDs?\" After he left, Courtney told Katya, \"He's a nice kid, and kind of cute.\" \"You know, he's a virgin,\" Katya said. \"Sure,\" Courtney replied. She went silent, contemplating this piece of information for a few moments, then nodded her head and told Katya, \"I'd give him a mercy fuck.\" That night, Mystery returned. He had a stripper on each arm. They looked like they'd been working in the same dark club for twenty years; our hundred-watt lightbulbs weren't serving them well. \"Hey, buddy,\" he said, as if he'd just come back from the grocery store. \"Where were you?\" \"I went to a strip club and spent the night with Gina.\" \"Hi,\" said a horse-faced brunette on his left arm. She lifted her waving hand meekly. \"Well, dude, you should have called. It's okay to have your little spat with Katya, but Herbal and I were really worried. That wasn't cool.\" Page 352 336 He paraded the girls through the house, making sure he introduced them to Katya, then sat on the patio with them. Katya went about her business. She showered, she cleaned the daily ex\u00ad plosion of peanut butter in the kitchen, and she did her special-effects- school homework on Herbal's face, giving him a lobotomy. While Mystery's stripper gambit had failed to make her jealous, it did succeed in making everyone else's respect for him dwindle further. Page 353 It was bound to happen. Katya eventually reached someone in the house. She'd been hitting on all of us since her pregnancy scare. It was Herbal who ultimately cracked. He was laid-back. He never lost his cool. He liked to listen. He was modest and understated. In other words, he was the exact opposite of Mystery. All that time he had spent with Katya while Mystery was pouting or laying indolently in bed or sleeping with a stripper out of revenge had affected him. He had developed feelings for Katya. After watching her suffer through Mystery's manipulation and neg\u00ad lect, he'd even begun to believe that he was more worthy of her. \"It's getting harder and harder to say no,\" he told me. \"Just ask Mystery. He's probably over her by now.\" \"Yeah. After all, he was cool with the whole Sima thing.\" (Sima was Mystery's ex-MLTR from Toronto who Herbal had fooled around with.) So Herbal asked Mystery. The answer was no. But that evening, after fighting with Katya again, Mystery found Herbal in the living room. \"We're broken up,\" he said casually. \"She's all yours.\" They were words he would soon regret. Within hours, Herbal had his dick inside her. Since Courtney was sleep\u00ad ing in his bed, he fucked Katya in Playboy's room off the kitchen. When Mystery returned home that night from the Standard, he went to",
  "155": "the kitchen for a Sprite. That was when he heard them. The moans that had been his exclusive nightly serenade were being sung to another man. He stood outside Playboy's door in shock, listening to them have sex. Katya seemed to be enjoying it. Loudly. Mystery walked into the living room and collapsed on the floor. The blood drained from his face. Like his father's death, it affected him more than he could have predicted. Never underestimate your own capacity to care. \"I love her,\" he said, as the first tear trickled down his cheek. \"I love that girl.\" \"No you don't,\" I corrected him. \"You said the other day that you hated Page 354 338 her.\" The thoughts I'd been holding back for weeks came pouring out of me. \"All you like about her is her body. The only reason you're upset is be\u00ad cause you feel rejected.\" \"No. I'm pissed at her for not loving me back.\" \" She loved you more than any other girl I've seen you with. She sat with me in the hot tub one night talking about how scared she was to let go and really love you. And as soon as she did, you became a cold, shutdown, mis\u00ad erable bastard.\" \"But I love her.\" \"You say that about every girl you sleep with. That's not real love. It's fake love. It's an illusion.\" \"No it isn't,\" he screamed at the top of his lungs. \"You're wrong!\" He stood up, stomped to his room, and slammed the door, splintering paint onto the carpet. He'd been so neglected as a child that the withdrawal of love pulled all his emotional triggers, exploding the carapace of narcissism built by his childhood escapism. As I walked back to my room, a scene from The Wizard of Oz sprung into my head in which the Wizard tells the Tin Man, \"A heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others.\" I was looking forward to letting my dreams file away all my thoughts, worries, and aggravations so I could start the next day fresh. But I was way\u00ad laid by Courtney. She stood in my doorway, a sheaf of papers in her hand. \"You gotta get Frank Abagnale on the phone for me,\" she demanded. \"He can fix this. And call Lisa and tell her I need to see her.\" \"You got it.\" I had no idea what she was talking about. I didn't know how to get in touch with Frank Abagnale (the counterfeit artist whose memoir inspired the movie Catch Me If You Can) or, for that matter, Lisa, her guitarist. But by now I'd figured out how to deal with Courtney's constant demands: Just say yes and do nothing. She'd forget what she wanted in a few hours anyway. In the morning, I checked on Mystery. He was sitting on his bed in his robe, shaking and convulsing. His face was red and his eyes were full of tears. I'd never seen him like this before. When he was depressed in Toronto, he'd simply shut down and become catatonic. This time, he seemed to be in real pain. Evidently, Katya had come into his bathroom in the morning to get her toothbrush. Page 355 339 \"Do you want to tell me about what happened last night?\" Mystery had asked. \"Why should I? You basically gave me as a present to Herbal.\" \"Did you fuck him?\" \"Well, let's put it this way,\" she had said, \"I just had the most amazing sex of my life.\" It crushed him. \"I want to kill her.\" He rolled onto his back and moaned like a dying dog. \"Logically, I know I'm being controlled by my emotions. But my logic is just 2 percent right now. I feel emotionally raw.\" He clenched his bedsheet in his fist. \"I feel strange and empty, like after a shit.\" He rolled over and started sobbing again. \"I feel shit empty.\" I would have laughed if he were trying to be funny. As he grieved, I kept thinking of one of Courtney's lyrics: \"I made my bed/I'll lie in it.\" Mystery had made his bed. And now Herbal was lying in it. He raised his hands to the ceiling and screamed in his Anthony Rob- bins voice. Suddenly, Courtney poked her head in the door. \"Is it about me? I can sleep in the front room if you want.\" She could be so sweet. I walked into the living room and told Courtney what was going on. Katya was",
  "156": "sitting on the patio outside, smoking a cigarette. \"I feel so bad,\" Katya said. \"Poor Mystery.\" She made sympathetic sounds for him\u2014awws and mmms\u2014as if she were talking about her dog. Herbal shuffled to the table with his head slumped forward. He was silent, trying to think of something to say. Neither of them seemed to regret sleeping together. They just didn't realize that Mystery would take it so hard. None of us did. Courtney lit a cigarette and told Herbal about a threesome she'd expe\u00ad rienced and how sharing can be caring and how she ran away to San Fran\u00ad cisco to join Faith No More and how the Suicide Girls was her idea and how she tried to turn a groupie into an artist in Europe. Somewhere in her me\u00ad andering speech there was a metaphor for Herbal's current dilemma- caught between his closest friend and the girl he was falling in love with\u2014but we couldn't find it. Just then, Herbal's phone rang. He answered it and, with a shocked ex\u00ad pression on his face, handed it to Courtney. \"It's Frank Abagnale calling for you,\" he said. \"I guess he got my mes\u00ad sage.\" Page 356 340 I left the three of them on the patio and called Mystery's sister, Martina. \"He's starting to crash again,\" I said. \"How bad is it?\" \"It started off like normal heartbreak, but this morning he went over the edge. The situation seems to have triggered some kind of chemical reac\u00ad tion. He's crying uncontrollably right now.\" \"Well, if it gets any worse, I'll get him a ticket back to Toronto. If you can put him on the plane, we'll take care of him when he arrives.\" \"You realize that if he comes back to Toronto, everything will be lost. He's overstayed his visa here, so they'll never let him into the United States again. He'll have no chance of becoming a famous illusionist. And his pickup business will be destroyed.\" \"I realize that. But what choice do we have?\" \"I'll try to handle it myself.\" \"Just send him home. Health care in Canada is free. We can't afford to take him anywhere in the States\u2014especially if they institutionalize him.\" \"Let me try. If it gets worse, I'll send him back to you.\" Watching Mystery's relationship with Katya unfold had been an eye- opener. He invited her to move in. He married her. He got her not-pregnant. He ignored her and resented her. He gave Herbal permission to sleep with her. He was no one's victim but his own. In the meantime, ever since the New York Times article, half a dozen re\u00ad ality TV executives had called Mystery\u2014including the producers of Ameri\u00ad can Idol. VHl had even sent him a contract for a show in which he turned losers into Lotharios. The stardom Mystery wanted so desperately was his for the taking. But he wasn't calling anyone back. \"This has happened before,\" Martina sighed when I told her about the reality-show offers. \"Every time he gets close to making it, he breaks down and throws it all away.\" \"So do you mean ...\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"He's actually scared of the success he wants so badly.\" Page 357 The next night, Katya came home at 2:00 A.M. She was with Herbal and the couple from New Orleans she sometimes slept with. Mystery pushed open his door, sat on a pillow on the floor, and watched them as they drank in the common room. He was making an effort to hold himself together. The woman in the couple was six feet tall, with a gym-taut abdomen, brown hair hanging down to a well-sculpted butt, brand new fake breasts, and a large nose that was next in line for the plastic surgeon's scalpel. When Katya leaned over and made out with her, Mystery's face scrunched up and reddened. If he'd just held onto Katya a little longer, he could have had his elusive threesome. Instead he was confined to his pillow, watching Katya laugh with the couple, watching Herbal sit there with a self-satisfied grin, watching the girls change into bikinis and prance out to the hot tub, watch\u00ad ing Herbal join them. Katya had given Mystery her love, and now he was paying for tossing it in the trash. Whether intentionally or not, she was",
  "157": "rubbing her bisexuality, her youth, and her happiness in his face. By morning, Mystery's sanity had decomposed further. When he wasn't crying on the couches, he was patrolling the house, trying to make sure Katya and Herbal were apart. If he couldn't find them, he'd call her. Whether she answered the phone or not, the result was the same: Mystery would fly off the handle and destroy whatever was within arm's or leg's reach. He pulled several bookcases to the ground; decimated his pillows, leaving feathers strewn across his room; and threw his cell phone against the wall, snapping the apparatus in half and leaving a deep black dent in the plaster. \"Where's Katya?\" he'd ask Playboy. \"She's shopping for clothes on Melrose.\" \"Where's Herbal?\" \"He's, um, sort of with her.\" And then Mystery's heart would twist and his face would fall and his eyes would leak and his legs would give out from under him and he'd make Page 358 342 some bizarre evolutionary justification for it all. \"It's selfish genes,\" he'd say. \"It's the nonexistent potential baby punishing me for leaving.\" When Herbal returned from shopping on Melrose with Katya, I warned him, \"You're being tooled. She's using you to get back at Mystery.\" \"No,\" he said. \"It's not true. We have real feelings for each other.\" \"Well, can you do me a favor and just try not to see her until Mystery gets better? I'm going to ask her to leave the house for a while.\" \"Fine,\" he said, with some reluctance. \"But it's not going to be easy.\" That night, I took Katya and her brother to the movies. Plan A was to get her out of the house and away from Herbal so that Mystery didn't get any worse. Plan B was to fuck her in order to show Herbal that his connec\u00ad tion with Katya wasn't so special. Fortunately, plan A worked. \"You are destroying Mystery,\" I told her as I drove her back from the theater. \"You need to leave the house. And don't come back until I say it's okay. This isn't about you anymore. Mystery has a serious psychological problem, and you've set it off.\" \"Okay,\" she said. She looked up at me like a child being disciplined. \"And promise me not to sleep with Herbal again. You're hurting one of my roommates, and you're about to break the heart of another. I can't stand by and watch it.\" \"I promise,\" she said. \" The fun is over. You've made your point.\" \"Okay,\" she said. \"I'm done.\" \"Pinky swear?\" We locked pinkies. I should have made her swear on something more serious. Seduction was easy compared to this. Even if people were just pro\u00ad grams designed by evolution, as Mystery believed, they were apparently too complicated for any of us to truly understand. All we had figured out were a few simple cause and effect relationships. If you lower a woman's self- esteem, she will seek validation from you. If you make a woman jealous, she will become more attracted to you. But beyond attraction and lust, there were deeper feelings that few of us felt and none of us had mastered. And these feelings\u2014for which the heart and the word love axe. just metaphors- were tearing Project Hollywood, a house already divided, further apart. And so it came to pass that Mystery scared everyone out of the house Page 359 343 and he started talking about killing himself and I got him a Xanax from Katya and I put him in my car and I took him to the Hollywood Mental Health Center and he tried to run away twice and he wanted to hit on the therapist but couldn't. Six hours later, he left the clinic with a package of Seroquel pills in his hand and another Xanax in his system. I'd never heard of Seroquel before, so when we returned the house I looked at the pamphlet that came with it. \"For the treatment of schizophrenia,\" it read. Mystery took the pamphlet from my hands and looked it over. \"They're just sleeping pills,\" he said. \"They'll help me get to sleep.\" \"Right,\" I told him. \"Sleeping pills.\" Page 361 STEP 10 BLAST LAST-MINUTE Page 362 WHAT IS SEXUAL IS WHAT GIVES A MAN AN ERECTION. ...

At least, that's what Courtney Love had decided. Mystery was recovering, Katya was in New Orleans for six weeks, and there were good vibes to be spread. Cigarette hanging from her mouth, dropping ash onto her Betsey Johnson T-shirt, Courtney grabbed a giant mixing bowl from the cabinet. She opened the refrigerator and scanned for liquids, snatching two half- gallon cartons of lemonade and a quart of orange juice. She emptied them into the mixing bowl and, when that overflowed, several pots. Then she grabbed a handful of ice cubes from the freezer and dropped them into her brew. Finally, she plunged her black-charred fingers into each vessel and stirred. Juice sloshed onto the counter as ashes from the cigarette in her mouth fluttered into the mixing bowl. Stubbing her cigarette out on the yellow tile countertop, she looked around frantically until she noticed an overhead cabinet. She swung the doors open and thrust her hands inside, sticking her fingers into four glasses and squeezing them together to pull them out. One by one, she dipped the glasses into the bowl and filled them. Then she grabbed the rest of the glasses, any clean coffee mugs she could find, and a Pyrex measuring cup, and sloshed lemonade into all of them. In the living room, Mystery sat cross-legged on a couch, leading his first pickup seminar since returning from the mental-health center three weeks earlier. He wore a T-shirt and denim overalls. His feet were bare. Patches of unshaven hair dappled his chin, and his eyelids drooped lazily over unfocused eyes. He'd been taking the Seroquel regularly and sleep\u00ad ing out his depression. He was beginning to break through to the other side. \"There are three phases to a relationship,\" he told his students, speak\u00ad ing in a torpor. \"There's a beginning, a middle, and an end. And I'm going through the end right now. I'm not going to lie to you. I've cried three times in the last week.\" His six students glanced at each other, confused. They were there to Page 364 348 learn to get laid. But for Mystery this wasn't just a seminar; it was therapy. He'd been telling them about Katya for two hours now. \"This is what you're building up to, and it can be difficult,\" he went on. \"My plan for the next girl is to have a fake marriage again. The mistake I made last time was letting Katya and her mother know it was a joke. Next time, I'll have the wedding in the backyard. I'll have an actor be the preacher, and everyone except her and her parents will know we're not really getting married.\" One of the students, a good-looking man in his thirties with a crewcut and a jaw like a block of cement, raised his hand. \"But didn't you just get through telling us how the fake marriage was a disaster last time?\" \"I was just field-testing it,\" Mystery said. \"It's a great routine.\" Whenever Mystery returned from his depressions, his mental bearings shifted a little. This time there was an anger lurking beneath the surface, along with a new bitterness toward women. Suddenly, Courtney came careening out of the kitchen. \"Who wants lemonade?\" The students looked at her dumbstruck. \"Here you go,\" she said, forc\u00ad ing a glass on Mystery and another on Cementjaw. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked. \"You're cute.\" \"I'm a self-defense instructor,\" he said. \"Mystery is letting me sit in on the workshop in exchange for lessons in Krav Maga.\" Courtney shot off to the kitchen and came back with two more glasses of lemonade, then two more, and two more, until there were more glasses than people in the room. \"I think we're set on lemonade,\" Mystery said as she returned with two coffee mugs in her hands. \"Where's Herbal?\" she asked. \"I think he's showering.\" Courtney dashed to the bathroom and kicked the door. \"Herbal? Are you there?\" She kicked the door again, harder. \"I'm showering,\"",
  "159": "he yelled back. \"It's important. I'm coming in.\" She pushed through the door, ran inside, and ripped the shower cur\u00ad tain open. \"What's going on?\" Herbal asked, panicked. He stood there naked, his hair streaked white with shampoo. \"Is the house on fire?\" Page 365 343 \"I made this for you,\" Courtney said. She thrust a mug of lemonade in each of Herbal's wet hands and dashed away. Herbal stood there silently. Ever since he'd promised to stop talking to Katya, he'd been drifting through the house in a forlorn cloud of silence. Though he was too proud to admit it, his heart ached. He loved her. As Mystery's students broke for lunch, Courtney dashed past them and up the stairs to Papa's room, leaving a trail of lemonade drops on the car\u00ad pet. She burst through the door. Inside, Papa, Sickboy, Tyler Durden, Play\u00ad boy, Xaneus, and the mini-Papas were working on individual computers. Extramask was laying on Papa's unmade bed, reading the Bhagavad Gita. While staying at the house, Extramask had gotten bored and started read\u00ad ing Playboy's books on eastern religion, which had unexpectedly led him down a path of spiritual self-discovery. \"Courtney,\" Tyler Durden asked as she distributed drinks, \"can you get us on the guest list for Joseph's on Monday?\" Courtney picked up the phone, walked into the bathroom with Tyler, and dialed Brent Bolthouse, the promoter who threw the Monday night parties at Joseph's, famed for their tight guest lists and crowds of gorgeous wanna-bes. \"Brent,\" she said. \"My friend Tyler Durden is a professional pickup artist.\" Tyler waved his hands frantically in a futile attempt to signal Courtney not to talk about it. \"He picks up women for a living. It's really cool.\" Tyler dropped his head into his hands. \"Can you put him on the guest list so he can come with some of his pickup artist friends and pick up chicks?\" Courtney picked a strip of six wrapped condoms off the edge of the sink and wrapped it around her wrist like a bracelet, then began exploring the bathroom. She poked her head inside the two closets\u2014Papa's infamous guest bedrooms\u2014that were on either side of the toilet. \"Let me ask you something,\" she said as she withdrew from Tyler Dur- den's closet, which contained a suitcase, a pile of dirty clothes, and a mat\u00ad tress on the floor. \"Do you like women?\" On the other side of the bathroom's slotted windows, Cementjaw dragged a sandbag along the brickwork of the patio. \"I wasn't a misogynist when I started this,\" Tyler replied. \"But you get good and you start sleeping with all these women who have boyfriends, and you stop trusting women.\" A side effect of sarging is that it can lowers one's opinion of the oppo- Page 366 35D site sex. You see too much betrayal, lying, and infidelity. If a woman has been married three years or more, you come to learn that she's usually eas\u00ad ier to sleep with than a single woman. If a woman has a boyfriend, you learn that you have a better chance of fucking her the night you meet her than getting her to return a phone call later. Women, you eventually realize, are just as bad as men\u2014they're just better at hiding it. \"I got hurt a lot when I first started picking up,\" he continued. \"I'd meet an amazing girl I really liked, and we'd talk all night. She'd say she loved me and was so lucky to have met me. But then I'd fail one shit test, and she'd walk away and wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Everything we'd built up over the last eight hours would just go down the drain. So it hardened me.\" There are men in this world who hate women, who do not respect them, who call them bitches and cunts. These are not PUAs. PUAs do not hate women; they fear them. Simply by defining oneself as a PUA\u2014a title earned solely by the responses of women\u2014one becomes doomed to derive his entire self-esteem and identity from the attention of the opposite sex, not unlike a comedian's relationship to audience members. If they don't laugh, you're not funny. So, as self-esteem defense mechanisms, some PUAs",
  "160": "developed misogynist tendencies in the process of learning. Sarging could be hazardous to the soul. Outside the window, Cementjaw held the sandbag as Mystery flailed at it with long, limp punches. \"Harder,\" he yelled at Mystery. \"I want to see more aggression!\" Page 367 Beyond Project Hollywood, the whole community appeared to have taken on a dangerous, unstable edge. Fieldreports became not just about meeting girls but about getting into fights and being kicked out of clubs. Community members began living vicariously through the drama taking place in Project Hollywood, as well as through the distinct writings of Jlaix, a shotgun-toting karaoke-singing, Elvis-looking PUA whom Tyler Durden and Papa had discovered in San Francisco. MSN GROUP Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: FR\u2014Jlaixs First Stripper (Drugs Sold Separately) AUTHOR: Jlaix I just flew back from Vegas, and I'm fucking exhausted. I was thrown out of a karaoke bar last night for rolling on the floor and crying during the bridge of Journey's \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart).\" But this post is not about karaoke. It is about fucking a stripper. So lets get right to it, shall we? I got into town on Wednesday afternoon and began drinking. Some guys from work and I were staying at the Hard Rock, just like the characters on The OC did in this week's episode. We got ejected from the Hard Rock Cafe for making meat cocktails and daring each other to drink them. A typical meat cocktail contained beef, bacon, beer, mashed potatoes, more beer, ribs, ice, onions, mustard, A-l Sauce, salt, pepper, Nutrasweet, and perhaps a little vodka. After one of my co-workers puked on the table, we all went to the strip club Olympic Gardens. I was pissed because I wanted to sarge, not get some lame-ass lap dance. I'm always saying what a great pickup artist I am to the guys from work, and I needed to show them I wasn't just talking out of my ass. I'd been training for this thing hard and was frankly a little nervous that I'd look like a tool if I didn't pull on this trip. Furthermore, I don't like strip clubs because I refuse to pay for sex of any kind. But I went along for the ride and sat there with a beer while the guys had their fun. Page 368 352 So this girl sat down across the booth from me. It turned out she worked there, but decided to take the day off because there weren't enough customers and there were too many chicks in the place. I started running routines on her and busting her balls. My friends were looking at me like I was insane because I kept calling her a dork. She kept saying, 'You are so cocky!\" and started really getting into me. My friends watched this happen with their jaws dropped open. I told her we were going back to our hotel and she should come and call some of her \"hot ho friends.\" She got pissed that I called her a ho, so I instantly changed the subject. \"Oh my God, my friend is so weird. She eats lemons whole, just like an orange blah blah.\" And this made her forget. More routines\u2014boom, boom, boom. This went on for a while. We all left together. Outside, the manager was trying to get her to go back in and work. But I pulled her away, and we got into a cab. She said, \"I'm a stripper with a brain!\" I ran Mystery's \"we're too similar\" on her, then Style's Cs versus Us. When we got back to the hotel, I told her we should drop her shit off in my room. Up there, I did the cube on her. Then I told her, \"When I did this on Paris Hilton at the taco shop, she said her cube was as big as a hotel. What an egomaniac!\" So now she thought I was hanging with celebrities and models all the time, even though it actually happened to Papa. I also did Tyler Durden's new stuff about having standards and said, \"I'm so sick of dating these chicks who do drugs all the time and have plastic surgery. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love to blow rails off a shitty dive bar toilet tank as much as the next guy, but only once in while! I mean, you're not like that, are you?\" She qualified herself. Then I",
  "161": "asked her if she was a good kisser, and we kissed for a while. I stopped it and suggested we go downstairs for a drink. In the casino. I started running comfort routines, filling in the empty canvas of my life. I ran Supercuts, Summer of Ripped Abs, Balloons in the Park, Stripper Babysitter, and My Cat Got Laid. They're all stories from my life and, trust me, the titles are more interesting than the actual content. We walked around the casino looking for my friends for a while. Then I told her I was tired and needed to go to sleep, and she should come up and tell me a bedtime story and tuck me in. She asked, \"What are we going to do? Bad things? I've only known you thirty minutes!\" I said, \"Sheesh! I hope not! I have to wake up early so you better not keep me up! Besides, I have whiskey dick.\" This shit is classic; you guys have to use it. Page 369 353 We got to the room and three bozo co-workers were in there, wasted. I hurriedly pushed them out of the room, suggesting they go gamble. The chick looked at the desk and said, \"Someone's been doing coke here. I can tell. I'm a stripper.\" I serenaded the stripper. I sang \"On the Wings of Love\" by Jeffrey Osborne to her. I told her I wanted to cuddle, and we did and just talked for a while. I then told her I wanted to show her a trick. I got on her and initiated tonguedown. I told her, \"I wanna lick it,\" and took off her pants. No panties. I inspected her for sores, then began the licking. She had a clit piercing, which I'd never encountered before. It clicked on my teeth weirdly. I put the fingers in after five minutes and licked her into submission. Then I said, \"Too bad I have whiskey dick!\" She said, \"It looks okay to me,\" and I fucked the shit out of her. I had never seen real tits this big on a chick that skinny. Oh my fucking God, this was the hottest chick I've ever fucked: my first stripper and my first 9. I cuddled and snuggled with her afterward. She expressed shock at my many injuries and scars. I kissed this little-ass, adorable-ass stripper mothafucka tenderly and said, \"I'm not an insane maniac. I'm a poser insane maniac. I'm just dealing with the absurdity of existence by shoving absurdity down exis\u00ad tence's throat.\" She gave me her number and fold me to call her. I used the My Little Pony opener the next night. (\"Hey. Do you guys remember that shit My Little Pony? Yeah, well I was frying to remember, did they have powers? Blah blah.\") By the end of the night, after I got thrown out of the karaoke club, I was just going up to chicks and drunkenly bellowing, \"Maaaah liI poneee.\" I ended up getting thrown out of another strip club. The last thing I remember is sitting up in my bed watching the TV, confused and screaming at nobody, \"What the fuck am I watching? Is this The OC? What the fuck is this?\" until I realized that it was just an episode of Punk'd where they were pranking The OC cast. Then I passed out. \u2014Jlaix Page 370 The first time I saw her, she was taking a shit. I opened my bathroom door and she was sitting on the toilet. \"Who are you?\" I asked. \"I'm Gabby.\" Gabby was friends with Maverick, one of the many junior PUAs who or\u00ad bited our house and appeared in our living room every weekend uninvited. She had the attitude of a beauty queen but the body of a sack of tomatoes. I took a step back and started to close the door behind me. \"Hey,\" she said, flushing. \"This is a nice house. What do you do for work?\" Those words were an instant dealbreaker. Sarging in Los Angeles, one develops a radar for women who are users. The less tactful among them will ask, within the first few minutes of a conversation, what kind of car you drive or what you do for work or what celebrities in the room you're friends with in order to determine your social ranking and how useful you might be to them. The more tactful ones don't have to ask questions: They look at your watch; they see how people respond to you when you talk, they listen for indicators of insecurity in your speech.",
  "162": "These are the signals that PUAs call subcommunication. Gabby belonged to the less tactful of the species. As she washed her hands, she opened the medicine cabinet and in\u00ad spected the contents. Then she stepped into my room and continued her exploration. \"Are you a writer?\" she asked. \"You should write about me. I have a really interesting story. I want to be an actress. And you know how some people are just born to be famous.\" She snatched a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses from the top of my dresser and put them on. \"Well, that's me. Not that I'm special or anything. It's just something you know from a very young age because people treat you differently.\" A rich man doesn't have to tell you he's rich. As she chattered away, she grabbed a muffin from a plate on my desk. Today had been muffin day. Courtney had run around the house giving everyone plates full of more muffins than they could eat. Page 371 355 Gabby took a bite, then dropped the muffin back onto the plate. I couldn't figure out who had invited her into the house. Maverick wasn't around, and she wasn't friends with anyone else here. \"I have to do some work,\" I told her. \"But nice meeting you.\" I figured she could find her own way out of the house. But she must have taken a wrong turn. Mystery later discovered her sitting on his toilet. Both were such narcissists, I thought they'd repel each other like two positive ends of a magnet. Instead, they ended up having sex. She spent the next week at the house, sleeping with Mystery and cat- fighting with Courtney after borrowing her clothing without permission. Like Mystery, Cabby's biggest fear in life was having no one around to hear her talk, so she was constantly running around the house, gossiping, com\u00ad plaining, and getting on Courtney's nerves. One afternoon, as Courtney stood in the kitchen digging into a jar of peanut butter with two spoons, she asked Gabby, \"Aren't you ever going home?\" \"Home?\" Gabby looked at her funny. \"I live here.\" It was news to Courtney, to me, to Mystery. The house attracted people like that. Eventually, it would expel them all. Twyla was the next victim of Project Hollywood. She first apperared at the house when a stripper Mystery made out with several years ago was go\u00ad ing through a major depression. Having some experience in the matter, Mystery offered to give her advice one night while Gabby was out clubbing. However, the stripper came over drunk and with Twyla in tow. Twyla was no prize. She was a tattooed thirty-four-year-old Hollywood rock-and-roller with weathered skin, a body as hard as her face, black hair in a bird's nest of dreadlocks, and a heart of gold. She reminded me of a Pon- tiac Fiero, an old sporty model liable to break down at any moment. When Mystery and Twyla started flirting, their drunk, depressed friend burst into tears. She cried in the pillow pit for a half hour, until Twyla and Mystery finally scampered off to his room. Gabby returned home that night and, without a word of objection, crawled into bed with the two of them and promptly fell asleep. Gabby and Mystery weren't in love; they just wanted each other's shelter. That morning and the morning after, Twyla cooked pancakes for everyone in the house. Since she didn't appear to be leaving anytime soon, Mystery hired her as his personal assistant for four hundred dollars a week. Page 372 356 The more Mystery neglected Twyla, the more she began to believe she loved him. He hurt her over and over by chasing different women, and she kept coming back for more. Mystery seemed to enjoy the tears; they made him feel like he mattered to somebody. If Twyla wasn't crying in the house, it was Gabby. If it wasn't Gabby, it was someone else. From the chrysalis of Mystery's latest depression, a monster was emerging. Project Hollywood was supposed to be a way to surround ourselves with healthy, helpful influences to better ourselves, our career, and our sex lives. Instead, the house had turned into a vacuum for needy males and",
  "163": "neurotic females. It sucked in anyone with mental problems and scared away anyone of quality. Between permanent guests like Courtney, Mystery's women, and Papa's revolving door of new trainers, employees, and students, it was im\u00ad possible to tell how many people were actually living in the house. However, at least the way I rationalized it, I was continuing my learning and growing process. I've lived and worked alone most of my life. I've never had a strong social circle or a tight network of friends. I've never joined clubs, played team sports, or been part of any real group prior to the com\u00ad munity. Project Hollywood was bringing me out of my solipsistic shell. It was giving me the resources I needed to be a leader; it was teaching me how to walk the tightrope of group dynamics; it was helping me learn to let go of petty things like personal property, solitude, cleanliness, sanity, and sleep. It was making me, for the first time in my life, a responsible adult. I had to be: I was surrounded by children. Every day, someone ran up to me with a new crisis to be managed: DABBY: Mystery's being a dick. He says this isn't my house, and I'm not wanted here. MYSTERY: Courtney took eight hundred dollars from my room. She made it up to me by paying my rent, but her check bounced. COURTNEY: That guy with his pants pulled up too high is bothering me. Can you tell him to leave me alone? PLAYBOY: Courtney has her urine in our refrigerator. And Twyla's crying in my bathroom and won't come out. TWYLA: Mystery's trying to mack on some chick in his room, and he told me to fuck off. And Papa won't let me sleep in his room. Page 373 357 PAPA Cliff from Montreal has been staying in my room, and Courtney came up and took four of his books and three pairs of his under\u00ad wear. Every problem had a solution; every dispute had a compromise; every ego had a way to be stroked. I hardly had time to sarge anymore. The only new women I was meeting were the ones who came into the house. Keeping Project Hollywood from imploding was becoming a full-time job. Page 374 I left the house for an hour to get some groceries. Only an hour. And when I returned there was a red Porsche spewing smoke in the driveway, a thirteen-year-old girl in the living room, and two pissed-off bleached blondes smoking on the patio. \" What the hell is going on?\" I asked as I kicked the door shut behind me. \"This is Mari,\" Mystery said. \"The cleaning lady's daughter?\" We were never able to hold onto a maid. The task of cleaning a week's accumulation of dishes, overflowing trash cans, fast-food debris, spilt alcohol, and cigarette butts from a dozen guys and countless party girls was more than most could handle. Consequently, Project Hollywood tended to stew in its own filth for a month or more between maids. The latest had set a record: two consecu\u00ad tive weeks. \" The cleaning lady left the house for supplies, so I'm watching her.\" He took a few strides closer to me. \"She reminds me of my nieces.\" It was nice to see Mystery acting somewhat normal again. An adoles\u00ad cent in the house was a calming influence on him. As for the Porsche, Courtney had it brought to the house so that Mystery could drive her to re\u00ad hearsal. But Mystery had taken the car for a test run and found out the hard way that he couldn't rely on his magical intuition to teach him how to drive a stick shift. \"And who are they?\" I asked, pointing at the blondes. \"They're in Courtney's band.\" I went out to the patio and introduced myself. \"I'm Sam,\" said a slightly tomboyish girl with a Queens accent. \"I play drums with Courtney.\" \"We've met before,\" I told her. \"We've met before too,\" sneered the other girl. Her Long Island ac\u00ad cent was so sharp that it startled me. She was two inches taller than me, her hair was pushed straight back over her head like a horse's mane, and her large brown eyes were framed with thick black mascara that re- Page 375 359 minded me of masturbating as a teenager to Susanna Hoffs in the Ban\u00ad gles",
  "164": "video for \"Walk Like an Egyptian.\" This girl was the epitome of rock and roll. \"Yeah,\" I stammered. \"I saw you briefly at The Tonight Show?\" \"Before that. At that party at the Argyle Hotel where you were talking to those twins the whole night.\" \"Oh, the Porcelain TwinZ.\" I couldn't imagine having forgotten her. She was so charismatic. Good posture is one of the things I find most at\u00ad tractive about a woman, and this girl's posture screamed confidence. It also screamed, \"Don't fuck with me.\" I went back inside and asked Mystery about her. \"That's Lisa, Court\u00ad ney's guitarist,\" he said. \"She's a total bitch.\" The girls were visiting because Courtney had planned to tape an acoustic performance at our house for a British television program. But Courtney was nowhere to be found, and Sam and Lisa were fuming. I sat down to pacify her bandmates. I felt so small next to them. I picked up a CD case that belonged to Lisa and thumbed through the discs. I was impressed. She had music by Cesaria Evora, a diva from the Cape Verde islands. Her mournful songs, backed by a lilting Latin rhythm, are perhaps the best make-out music on the planet. As soon as I saw that CD, I knew I'd met someone I wanted to get to know better. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I dimly recalled what enabled me to meet and interact with women before I'd discovered the seduction indus\u00ad try: commonalities. Simply finding out that you have a passion for some\u00ad thing another person also likes and respects is enough to fire that strange emotion we like to call chemistry. Scientists studying pheromones claim that when two people discover they have things in common, pheromones are released and attraction begins. Moments later, Mystery joined us. He dropped into a chair and sat there for a moment, a vortex of neediness sucking up any stray pheromones Lisa and I had managed to release. \"I called Katya today,\" he said. \"And we talked for a while. I still love that girl.\" He looked at Sam and Lisa, as if trying to select a target. \"Do they know about the drama with Katya?\" he asked. The girls rolled their eyes. They had their own drama to deal with. \"Well,\" I excused myself. \"I'm going to grab a burrito at Poquito Mas. Nice meeting you\u2014again.\" Page 376 360 I had to get away from there. I didn't want to be associated with the madness\u2014even if l was part of it. I walked down the hill to Poquito Mas, where I found Extramask sit\u00ad ting at a table outside, reading a book as thick as his skull. He was wearing shorts, a headband, and a torn white T-shirt with a fresh sweat stain from the gym. It was the first time I'd seen him out of the house alone in months. Ever since meeting him at Mystery's first workshop, I'd felt like he was my younger brother in this whole endeavor\u2014though, since joining the Real So\u00ad cial Dynamics crew, he'd been more like an estranged sibling. I decided to make an effort to reconnect with him. \"What are you reading?\" I asked. \"I Am That by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj,\" he said. \"I like him better than Sri Ramana Maharshi. His teachings are more modern and easier to read.\" \"Wow\u2014impressive.\" I didn't know what else to say; I wasn't particularly familiar with Indian Vedanta writing. \"Yeah, I'm starting to realize there's more to life than just girls. All of this stuff\"\u2014he gestured up the hill to Project Hollywood\u2014\"means nothing. Everything means nothing.\" I half-expected him to burst out in laughter at any moment and start talking about his penis, like the old days. \"So you're over sarging then?\" I asked. \"Yeah, I was obsessed with it, but when I read your post about social ro\u00ad bots, I realized I was becoming one. So I'm moving out.\" \"Are you heading back to your parents' house or getting your own place?\" \"Neither,\" he said. \"I'm going to India.\" \"That's amazing. For what?\" When Extramask had come into the com\u00ad munity, he was one of the most sheltered people I'd ever met. He'd never even been on a plane before. \"I want to figure out who I am. There's an ashram near",
  "165": "Chennai called Sri Ramanasramam, and I want to stay there.\" \"For how long?\" \"Six months or a year, or possibly forever. I really don't know. I'm just kind of rolling with it.\" I was surprised but not shocked. Extramask's sudden transformation Page 377 361 from pickup artist to spiritual seeker reminded me of Dustin. Some people spend their lives trying to fill a hole in their soul. When women don't ab\u00ad sorb that emptiness, they look to something bigger: God. I wondered where Dustin and Extramask would turn afterward, when they discovered that even God wasn't big enough to plug the hole inside. \"Well, man, good luck on your journey. I wish I could say that I was go\u00ad ing to miss you, but we've hardly even talked to each other for half a year now. It's been a little strange.\" \"Yeah,\" he said. \"That's my fault.\" He paused, and his lips forced them\u00ad selves into a curvy smile. For a moment, the old Extramask was back. \"I used to be an insecure bitch,\" he said. \"So was I,\" I told him. By the time I got back to the house, the TV producers from Britain had arrived, along with a prospective manager for Courtney and a stylist. \"I can't work with her anymore,\" the stylist said when it became clear that Courtney wouldn't be showing up in time for the shoot. \"Ever since she's been doing drugs, she's become a nightmare to deal with.\" We hadn't seen any evidence of drugs in the house, but considering Courtney's erratic behavior, perhaps Project Hollywood hadn't kept her away from them as she had hoped. I felt bad for her. She was allowing the problems of the house to distract her from the real-life issues she should have been dealing with. Perhaps we all were. I awoke that night to see Courtney standing at the foot of my bed with a Prada shoe in her hand. \"Let's redecorate the house,\" she said excitedly. \"This will be our hammer.\" I looked at the clock. It was 2:20 A.M. \"Do you have any nails or tacks?\" she asked. Without waiting for an an\u00ad swer, she ran downstairs and returned with a box of nails, a framed painting for my wall, a throw pillow for my bed, and a smashed pink box that looked like an old Valentine's Day present. \"This is the heart-shaped box,\" she said. \"I want you to have it.\" She picked up my guitar, sat on the edge of my bed, and played my fa\u00ad vorite country song, \"Long Black Veil.\" \"I'm going to a friend's birthday party tomorrow night at Forbidden City,\" she said, dropping the guitar to the floor. \"I want you to come too. It'll be good for us to get out of the house together.\" Page 378 362 \"I'll tell you what. I'll meet you there.\" I knew how long she could take to get ready. \"Okay. I'll go with Lisa.\" \"Speaking of Lisa,\" I said. \"There were a bunch of people waiting for you here today and you were nowhere to be found. I think they're pretty upset.\" Her face clouded, her lips puckered, and tears dripped from her eyes. \"I'm going to get help,\" she said. \"I promise.\" Page 379 I wore a white blazer over a black shirt emblazoned with a scrolling bank of LCD lights that could be programmed with a message. I input the words \"Kill me.\" I hadn't been out sarging in at least a month and wanted the at\u00ad tention. My expectations for Courtney showing up to Forbidden City were low, so I brought Herbal along as a wing. We had recently flown to Houston together to pick up the Project Hol\u00ad lywood limousine, a 1998 ten-passenger stretch Cadillac Herbal had found on eBay. Flush with the success of that scheme, Herbal had, against our bet\u00ad ter judgment, put down a deposit to buy a wallaby at an exotic pets website. On the way to the party, we argued about the practicality and humanity of having a baby marsupial in the house. \"They make the best pets,\" he insisted. \"They're like house-trained kan\u00ad garoos. They sleep with you, they bathe with you, and you can take them for walks by holding their tail.\" The last thing we needed was a wallaby in the mix at Project Holly\u00ad wood. The only bright side to the fiasco was that it made for a great",
  "166": "opener. We ran around the party asking everyone for their opinion on having walla\u00ad bies as pets. Between the opener and my shirt, within a half hour we were surrounded by women. It felt good to flex our skills again. We'd been so ab\u00ad sorbed by the drama of the house that we had forgotten the reason we'd moved there in the first place. As a tall, stoop-shouldered girl who claimed to be a model pawed at my shirt, I saw a mane of bleached-blonde hair sticking up out of the crowd. I looked closer. Though she was on the other side of the room, she seemed to glow. Her jaw was set, her face was chiseled, her eyes smoldered beneath a half-shell of heavy blue eye shadow. It was Courtney's guitarist, Lisa. Next to her, all the wanna-be models and actresses I had been talking to seemed insignificant. She dwarfed them with her style and poise. I excused myself and ran up to her. \"Where's Courtney?\" I asked. \"She was taking too long to get ready. So I came alone.\" Page 380 364 \"I respect a person who isn't afraid to show up at a party alone.\" \"I am the party,\" she said, without blinking or smiling. I think she was serious. For the entire night, Lisa and I sat side-by-side in a chair, the most pea\u00ad cocked couple in the room. The party seemed to come to us, as if we exerted some sort of gravitational pull together. The couches around us soon filled with models, comedians, reality TV has-beens, and Dennis Rodman. When the various women I had talked to during the night came by to flirt, Lisa and I drew on their arms with pens or fed them shots of Hypnotiq or gave them intelligence tests that they usually failed. This is what the PUAs call creating an \"our world\" conspiracy. We were in our own little bubble, where we were king and queen, and everyone else was our plaything for the night. When a phalanx of paparazzi started taking pictures of Dennis Rod\u00ad man, who was standing nearby, I looked at Lisa's face, illuminated by the flashbulbs. And out of nowhere, my heart awoke from its torpor and body- checked my chest. When the party broke up, Lisa put her arm around me and asked, \"Will you take me home? I'm too drunk to drive.\" My heart slammed again, and then settled into a fast, arrhythmic throb. She may have been too drunk to drive, but I was too nervous to drive. Without waiting for a response, she dropped the keys to her Mercedes into my hand. I called to Herbal and asked him to drive my car home. \"I can't believe it,\" I told him. \"It's on!\" But it wasn't on. I drove Lisa back to her place. I recognized the building: It was directly across the street from the Hollywood Mental Health Center where I had taken Mystery. When we arrived, she went to the bathroom. I lay down on her bed and tried to look relaxed. Lisa padded out of the bathroom, looked at me, and then said, with a withering look, \"Don't think anything's going to happen between us.\" Damnit, I'm Style. You have to love me. I'm an mPUA. She changed, and we drove to my house to look for Courtney. All we found there, however, was Tyler Durden leading ten men in the living room through some sort of exercise that involved running around the couches, yelling loudly, and giving each other high fives. Tyler had been experiment\u00ad ing lately with a technique of physically pumping up his students' mood for a night out meeting women. He believed that whether or not they actually performed better, the shot of adrenaline and camaraderie would make Page 381 365 them think they had fun, and thus give Real Social Dynamics good reviews in the seduction newsgroups. It was becoming a competitive industry. Courtney seemed to have disappeared again. Maybe she'd been serious the other night and really was getting help, or maybe she was off getting into more trouble. I took Lisa up to my room, lit some candles, put Cesaria Evora in the CD player, and went to my closet. \"Let's have some fun,\" I told her. I pulled out a garbage bag full of old Halloween costumes: masks, wigs, hats. We tried them all on, taking",
  "167": "photos with my digital camera. I was go\u00ad ing to attempt the digital photo routine. We took a photo smiling, then serious. For the third photo, the roman\u00ad tic pose, we gazed at each other. Her eyes seemed so happy. Behind that tough exterior was vulnerability and tenderness. I held her eye contact and moved toward her for the kiss, holding the camera in front of us to capture it. \"I'm not kissing you,\" she barked. The words scalded my face like hot coffee. There was no girl I couldn't kiss within half an hour of meeting her. What was her problem? I froze her out and tried again. Nothing. It is in these moments that, as a PUA, you start to question the work you've done on yourself You begin to worry that maybe she sees the real you, the one who existed before the silly nickname, the one who wrote po\u00ad ems about this exact situation in high school. I delivered a moving, impassioned performance of the evolution phase-shift routine. Somewhere in the distance, I heard a thousand PUAs applauding. \"I'm not biting you,\" she said. I wasn't through. I told her the most beautiful love story ever written: \"On Seeing the 100 Percent Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning\" by Haruki Murakami. It is about a man and a woman who are soul mates. But when they doubt their connection for a moment and decide not to act on it, they lose each other forever. She was ice cold. I tried a hardcore freeze-out: I blew out the candles, stopped the music, turned on the lights, and checked my e-mail. She climbed into my bed, curled up under the covers, and went to sleep. Finally I joined her, and we slept on opposite sides of the bed. Page 382 366 I still had one trick left: going caveman. In the morning, without a word, I started massaging her leg, working my hand slowly up her thigh. If I could just turn her on physically, her logic would disengage and she would no doubt submit. My intention wasn't to use Lisa for sex. I knew I wanted to see her again, no matter what happened. I just wanted to get the whole sex thing over with so we could be normal together. She wouldn't be trying to keep anything from me; I wouldn't be trying to get something from her. I always hated the idea that sex is something a woman gives and a man takes. It is something that should be shared. But Lisa wasn't sharing. As I began to rub the warm crease where her thigh meets her pelvis, her voice rang shrill in the air like an alarm clock. \"What are you doing?\" She smacked my hand away. We had breakfast together, and lunch, and dinner. We talked about Courtney and the PUAs and my writing and her music and our lives, and all kinds of other things that I can't remember but must have been fascinating because hours passed in the blink of an eye. She was my age; she liked all the same bands I did; she said something intelligent every time she opened her mouth; she laughed at my jokes that were funny and made fun of the ones that weren't. She spent another night with me. Nothing happened. I had met my match. After breakfast, I stood on the front stoop and watched Lisa leave. She walked uphill, climbed into her Mercedes, lowered the convertible top, and pulled away. I turned around to climb the stairs. I didn't want to glance back. I wanted to look cool, and not give her any more IOIs. \"Hey, come here,\" she yelled from her car. I shook my head no. She was ruining my exit. \"No, seriously, come here. It's important.\" I sighed and walked back down to her car. \"I'm really sorry, don't be up\u00ad set,\" she said. \"But I think I might have accidentally dented your limo when I was pulling out.\" My body went cold. It was our newest and most expensive possession. \"Just kidding,\" she said, stepping on the accelerator and leaving me in the dust with a wave. I saw her blonde hair streaming over the side of the car as she turned down Sunset, blasting the Clash. I had been played by her\u2014again. Page 383 I told Mystery about my frustration with Lisa as we sat in the hot tub one night. I'd turned to him so often",
  "168": "in the past for advice on women, and he'd rarely steered me wrong. Though relationship management was clearly not his forte, he was flawless when it came to blasting through last- minute resistance. \"Start stroking yourself,\" he said. \"Now? Here?\" \"No, next time you're in bed together, just take your cock out and start stroking it.\" \"Then what?\" \"Then you take her hand and put it on your balls. And she'll start giv\u00ad ing you a hand job.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Yes. Then you put your finger on your dick and put a little precum on it, and put your finger in her mouth.\" \"No way. This is like that bad joke advice you see in movies, where the friend does it and the girl freaks out and the guy who gave the advice goes, 'I thought you knew I was kidding.'\" \"I'm totally serious. You've practically had sex after that.\" Three days later, after the bars closed at 2:00 AM, Lisa dropped by my house with Sam, Courtney's drummer. She was wasted. We climbed into bed and babbled to each other for hours. \"I don't know what my problem is,\" she slurred. \"I never want to leave your room. I could just listen to you talk forever.\" She rolled toward me. \"Forget I said that,\" she snapped. \"I didn't mean it. Alcohol is like a truth serum.\" Now was my chance. Mystery's words ran through my head, and I con\u00ad sidered the pros and cons of stroking myself and placing her hand on me. I couldn't do it. Not because I was scared, but because there was no way it was going to work. Lisa would have laughed in my face and said some\u00ad thing cutting like, \"You might as well touch yourself, because I'm certainly Page 384 368 not about to.\" Then she would have told all her friends about the cheesy guy who started rubbing his dick in front of her. Mystery wasn't always right. So we spent another platonic night together. It was driving me crazy. I knew she liked me. Yet she wouldn't get intimate. I was teetering on the border of being LJBF'ed. Maybe I just wasn't her type. I imagined her with tattooed, muscle- bound, leather-jacketed Danzig types, not scrawny metrosexual guys who had to take pickup workshops. She was killing me. For the first time since I'd learned the word one-itis, I had it. And I knew that I was doomed. No one ever gets his one-itis. He gets too clingy and needy and blows it. And, sure enough, I blew it. The next night, Lisa left town to play a festival in Atlanta with Court\u00ad ney. She called three times while she was gone. \"Are you free for dinner when I get back?\" she asked. \"I don't know,\" I told her. \"It depends on whether you can behave your\u00ad self or not.\" \"Fine, then,\" she said. \"If you're going to be like that, I don't need to go.\" I was just trying to tease her and bust her balls, like David DeAngelo had taught me. And in doing so, I had destroyed the moment. I sounded like an asshole. \"Don't be a troublemaker,\" I said. It was time to be straightforward. \"I want to see you when you're back. I'm leaving town for two weeks, so it will be our last chance to hang out.\" In the background, I could hear Sam speaking. \"You're talking to him like he's your boyfriend,\" she told Lisa. \"Maybe I want him to be my boyfriend,\" Lisa said to her. So I hadn't been LJBF'ed. I couldn't wait for her to come back. I wanted her to be my girlfriend too. I spent the entire day of Lisa's return plotting the perfect seduction. I would pick her up from the airport in the limo. Herbal would drive, and I would wait for her in the backseat. Then I'd take her to the Whiskey Bar at the Sunset Marquis Hotel\u2014walking distance from Project Hollywood. Because women don't respect guys who pay for them but at the same time are turned off by guys who are cheap, I went to the Whiskey Bar ahead of time, gave the manager $100, and told him to make sure whatever we or\u00ad dered was on the house. Afterward, I planned to take her home. On my Page 385 3E9 computer, I wrote down all the patterns and routines I would use to combat her LMR. Now that I knew she liked me, I had the confidence to push",
  "169": "this thing to the end. If she still resisted, then she clearly had intimacy issues and I'd have to be the one to LJBF her. Her flight was scheduled to arrive at 6:30 P.M. As Herbal drove the limo past the Delta terminal looking for her, I mixed Cosmopolitans at the bar in the back of the car. When the flight arrived, however, she wasn't on it. I was confused, but not disappointed\u2014yet. A PUA must be willing to change or abandon any plan when confronted with the chaos and chance of reality. So Herbal drove me home, and I left a message for Lisa. When she didn't call back, I left another message and then waited all night in vain to hear from her. At five o'clock that morning, I was awakened by my cell phone ringing. \"Sorry to wake you up, but I need to talk to someone.\" The voice on the other end was a man's. The accent was Australian. It was Sweater. Since I'd last seen Sweater, he had left the community and gotten mar\u00ad ried. I thought about him often. Every time someone asked if guys in the community were learning these skills just to have sex with as many women as possible, I pointed to Sweater as an example of someone who had gotten into the game for all the right reasons. \"I tried to kill myself today,\" he said. \"What happened?\" \"My wife is expecting our first baby in ten days, and I'm miserable. I do everything for her, but it's not enough. She's driven me away from my friends. My business partner is leaving me. She spends all my money and all she does is complain.\" He paused to choke back his tears. \"And now that she's having this baby, I'm trapped.\" \"But you were in love with her. How can she just change?\" \"No. The problem is that I changed. It was too hard to be that person who Mystery and David DeAngelo taught us to be. That person wasn't a good guy. And that's not the kind of person I wanted to be. I like doing nice things for people. So I got her whatever she wanted. I sent her flowers three times a week. I tried it her way, but it didn't work.\" I'd never heard grown men cry as much as I had in the last two years. \"I sat in the garage today with the motor running and the windows up,\" he Page 386 37D continued. \"I haven't thought of suicide since 1986. But I just got to the point where I was like, 'Fuck.' I didn't see any purpose in living.\" Sweater didn't need to be saved. He just wanted a friend to talk to. He had pretended to be someone he wasn't just to seduce a woman, and now he was suffering the consequences. \"When I first got in the community, I wrote down everything I wanted,\" he said. \"And now I'm living the life I imagined. I have the money, the big house, and the beautiful girl. But I wasn't specific enough about the beauti\u00ad ful girl. I never wrote that she had to treat me with respect and kindness.\" Later that morning, Courtney returned to the house. I could hear her screaming at Gabby in the living room. I walked downstairs to discover Courtney carrying Cabby's bags out of the house, and I found myself saying the same three words that seemed to come out of my mouth every time I entered the living room: \"What's going on?\" \"Gabby got into a fight with Mystery, and she's moving out,\" Courtney said. \"So I'm helping her.\" Courtney could barely conceal her smile. \"Did the rest of the band get back from Atlanta yet?\" I asked, trying to sound casual. \"Yeah. They came home on an earlier flight.\" I turned away quickly. I knew if I said anything in response, my voice would betray my disappointment. After Gabby left, Courtney threw a bundle of sage on the coffee table. \"Let's clear the air in here,\" she said. Then she skipped off to the kitchen, ex\u00ad plaining, \"We need some rice for good fortune.\" Unable to locate any rice, she returned with a package of jambalaya mix and a bowl of water. She poured the jambalaya mix into the water, planted the sage in the middle of it, and then ran to her room. She emerged carrying a blue-and-white-checkered flannel shirt. \"This will work,\" she said. \"It's one of Kurt's shirts. I",
  "170": "only have three of them left.\" She carefully arranged the shirt underneath the table, safe from harm, so that it could bring good energy to the house. After lighting the sage, she sat Mystery, Herbal, and me down next to her makeshift altar, and we joined hands. Her grip was bone-crushing. \"Thank you God for this day and all that you have given us,\" she Page 387 371 prayed. \"We ask that you clear the energy of this house of all evil. Please bring peace and harmony and friendship under this roof. No more tears! And help me win my court case in New York and help clear up all my other problems. I will work with you, God. I really will. Give me strength. Amen.\" \"Amen,\" we repeated. The next day, a driver came and whisked Courtney to the airport to go to New York. There, her prayers for herself would eventually be answered, but the atmosphere in the house would only grow darker in her absence. Courtney and Gabby, it soon became clear, weren't the cause of any prob\u00ad lems: They had merely been the symptoms of something much larger that was eating away at our lives. Page 388 That afternoon, Lisa left me a short voice mail. \"Hi, it's Lisa. I'm back. We took an earlier flight.\" That was it. No apology, no tenderness, no mention of the plans she had completely blown off. I called her back, but she didn't answer. \"I'm leaving town in a few hours to go to Miami with Vision,\" I told her voice mail. \"I would really love to talk to you before I leave.\" It was an AFC message, and I never heard back from her. I checked my voice mail every day while I was away. Nothing. I wasn't a plower, like Tyler Durden. If she were interested, she would have called. I'd been blown off. And by the first woman I had felt something for in a while. I figured she'd probably started dating someone else, some\u00ad one who had been able to break through her LMR. First I was angry at her, then I was angry at myself, and then I was just sad. The PUAs had always advised that the best way to get over a one-itis is to fuck a dozen other girls. So I went on a rampage. I didn't want to end up like Sweater, anyway. I had almost let myself get caught. I went sarging every night in Miami, with more fire, drive, and success than I'd ever had. I've never been a fan of one-night stands. Once you've gotten that close to someone, why throw it away afterward? I'm more a fan of ten-night stands: ten nights of great sex, each one getting steamier, wilder, and more experimental as two people grow more comfortable to\u00ad gether and learn what turns each other on. So after I slept with each woman, I mixed and matched them like jellybeans. It was my reality. The girls I was most looking forward to getting together were Jessica, a tattoo-covered twenty-one-year-old I'd slept with a few times in Los Angeles, and another Jessica, who I'd met at Crobar. She was also twenty-one, but the exact opposite of Jessica I. She was innocent looking, with a touch of baby fat. I knew they both liked porn, so I thought things might get interesting. After a drink at the hotel bar, I brought them up to my room for a rune Page 389 373 reading and then left them alone for a few minutes to get acquainted. When I returned, I showed them home movies on my laptop and then began the trusty dual-induction massage. It was all just a routine now, like the jealous girlfriend opener or the best friends test. And it worked just as consistently. Once the girls' lips touched, they transformed from strangers to lovers. It shocked me every time to see two women get intimate so quickly in such an unusual situation. The night was as nasty as I'd anticipated. We tried every position we could twist into, some more successfully than others. When Jessica I asked me to come in her mouth, I obliged. She spit the wad into Jessica II's mouth, and they started making out passionately. It was the sexiest mo\u00ad ment of my entire life. But afterward I felt empty and alone. I didn't care about them. All I re\u00ad ally had was a memory and a story.",
  "171": "Every girl in my life could disappear and never call me again, and I wouldn't have cared. All the ten-night stands and threesomes in the world wouldn't be enough to get me over my one-itis. The PUAs were wrong. Page 390 Male sexuality may seem on the surface like it runs rampant in society\u2014 there are strip clubs, porn websites, Maxim-style magazines, and titillating advertisements everywhere. But, despite all this, true male desire is often kept repressed. Men think about sex more than they will ever let women, or even each other, know. Teachers think about fucking their students, fathers think about fucking their daughter's friends, doctors think about fucking their patients. And right now, for every woman with even an iota of sex appeal, there's probably a man somewhere in the world who's touching himself and thinking about what it would be like to fuck her. She may not even know him: He may be that businessman who walked past her in the street or the college student who sat across from her on the subway. And any man who tells a woman otherwise is most likely doing so because he's trying to get in her pants, or the pants of someone else within earshot. The great lie of modern dating is that in order to sleep with a woman, a man must pretend initially as if he doesn't want to. Most appalling to women is the male obsession with strippers, porn stars, and teenage girls. It is abhorrent because it threatens a woman's real\u00ad ity. If all men really desire a woman like that, then where does that leave her marriage and happily-ever-after fantasies? She's doomed to live them with a man who really wants that Victoria's Secret model or the neighbor's daugh\u00ad ter or that dominatrix in the videos he hides in his closet. As a woman ages, an eighteen-year-old girl will always be eighteen. Love is dashed on the rocks in the face of the possibility that a man doesn't want a person but a body. Fortunately, this is not the entire story. Men are visual thinkers; thus we're often deceived by our eyes. But the truth is that the fantasy is often better than the reality. I had just learned that lesson. Most men eventually learn that lesson. Mystery may have thought he wanted to live with two girls who love each other as much as they love him, but chances are they'd get on his nerves, team up against him, and eventually make him just as miserable as he'd been with Katya. Page 391 375 Men are not dogs. We merely think we are and, on occasion, act as if we are. But, by believing in our nobler nature, women have the amazing power to inspire us to live up to it. This is the one reason why men tend to fear commitment\u2014and sometimes, as in Mystery's case, even rebel against it by endeavoring to bring out the worst in a woman. Page 392 While I was in Miami, Katya returned. I dreaded the day and the terror it would unleash in the house. But Mystery was looking forward to it like a birthday. He had it all planned out. Because I was away, I have reconstructed the story of the disaster that ensued from the accounts of those involved. Project Hollywood had reached a new nadir. MYSTERY: I met a nineteen-year-old hottie named Jen at an after- party at the house. I full-montied her, and it was amazing, like the shower scene in 9 1/2 Weeks. She had the softest, purest skin and the best ass I'd ever been with. And I was standing there just looking at that ass and that skin thinking, \"I deserve this.\" KATYA: Mystery called me every other day while I was in New Orleans, trying to sweet-talk me. He said, \"I have this beautiful nineteen- year-old girl that you'll love.\" I asked him if he was giving her to me. He said, \"No, we're sharing.\" MYSTERY: The idea wasn't for Katya to be my girlfriend again, but to be a playtoy for Jen and me. My plan was to pick her up from the airport in the limo, grab some food at the Farmer's Market, and then go back to the house and do the dual-induction mas\u00ad sage. HERBAL: I ignored Katya for almost the entire month and a half she was gone,",
  "172": "even though she kept sending me text messages. Mys\u00ad tery spent the whole time bragging about how he was going to get a threesome with her, which was like a knife being twisted in my heart. I told Mystery repeatedly just to ignore her and not let her back in the house to avoid problems. But he wouldn't do it. Page 393 377 KATYA: I flew into Los Angeles the day before, which Mystery doesn't know, to rent a studio apartment and hang out with some friends from New Orleans. I stayed in a hotel and called Herbal to talk, because at that point I really wanted to start dating him. The next morning, I just showed up at the house and told Mystery my plane got in early so I took a taxi. HERBAL: When I came home from doing errands and saw Katya's suitcase, I went into my room to mind my own business. How\u00ad ever, Mystery and Katya came in and started talking to me. Then we went to Mystery's bathroom and Katya painted our nails. She disappeared into Mystery's walk-in closet to get a sweater, then Mystery went in. After five minutes, they were still in the closet. MYSTERY: She called me into the closet and said, '7 want to date Herbal.\" I don't think she said it because she truly wanted to be with him. She just said it to bug me. I was being too kissy-kissy with Jen, and I believe that triggered jealousy in her. So I called Herbal into the closet and told Katya, \"Why don't you say it to him?\" KATYA: I really liked Herbal. We talked on the phone throughout my entire visit to New Orleans, and I enjoyed his personality. He was so easygoing, and he never disagreed with anything. MYSTERY: Herbal and Katya were hanging out, hugging and kind of awkward, so I said, \"Why don't you two kiss and get it over with?\" They did, and it instantly made me haywire. I didn't expect that to happen after so much time had passed. But, as David DeAngelo says, attraction is not a choice. HERBAL: That night, we went on a double date. Mystery asked Twyla to drive us in the limo to the Santa Monica Pier. I guess I was naive, but I really thought everything would be fine. TWYLA: I couldn't believe Mystery had the gumption to ask me to drive, to shove it in my face. He thought he was this grand manip\u00ad ulator. And it made me disgusted with myself for even liking this person. Page 394 378 MYSTERY: Jen and Katya ended up making out with each other in the limo that night. I have pictures of them sucking each other's tits in a phone booth at the pier. But it was getting complex. The moment Katya became Herbal's girlfriend, the threesome was off and I didn't want Jen touching Katya anymore. However, Katya was attracted to Jen, so she started talking trash about me to her. KATYA: Mystery kept saying he really liked Jen and not to make him look like an asshole in front of her. I told him, \"You guys are great. If anyone's going to put up with your shit, it's that girl.\" I was glad he had someone because I wanted Herbal. MYSTERY: Jen went home to San Diego for a week after that, and Katya called her every day. One night while Jen was gone, I had a six- foot-tall model in bed with me and was dealing with last-minute resistance. I was fingering her and getting jacked off, but I couldn't get any further. So during a freeze-out, I went to the kitchen to get a Sprite. And I heard Katya having sex with Herbal again. The moaning triggered feelings of jealousy, and I started crying. I couldn't stop, even though I had a girl in my bed. I went back to my room and told the model how fucked up my life was. So she said she wanted to go home. I was going to drive her, but then Twyla started laughing at me. TWYLA: I was sleeping in the pillow pit and Mystery walked by, upset. I kind of giggled a little bit because I was quite entertained by it all. At that point, I had to take it with humor, because if I didn't, I was going to end up hurt again. Then he flew off the handle and fired me. The girl he was with had to call a taxi home. KATYA: The next week, Mystery wanted to use my car to pick up",
  "173": "Jen from San Diego. On the way back to the house, Jen and I were chitchatting and having fun. Mystery felt left out so he started negging me. MYSTERY: I felt that Katya was trying to steal Jen from me and share her with Herbal. So I got pissed at Katya in the car, and we had a Page 395 379 blow-up. Jen saw this and said, \"Just take me home.\" After that, she asked me never to call her again. MYSTERY [Posted in Mystery's Lounge]: Be on the lookout for Herbal, Katya, and Jen. If anyone sees Herbal (easy to spot as he frequently peacocks) or his girlfriend Katya (a bi Russian 9.5, easy to spot) with Jen (a nineteen-year-old Mexican 9.5, also easy to spot), please call Mystery so I may administer punishment to Herbal without warning. KATYA: He thought I was trying to turn Jen against him. But after that car ride, she didn't want anything to do with me either. She thought I was lying by saying all that good stuff about Mystery. It made me look like an ass. MYSTERY: Herbal and I still had a business relationship. So we went to Chicago together for a workshop. Because I'm fascinated by the mind, I'd explain to him the jealousy I was feeling and we'd draw various boundaries on his relationship with my ex- girlfriend. HERBAL: On the last day of the Chicago workshop, Mystery and I went to get food together. Mystery opened a four-set of girls next to us. During the sarge, he said, \"Can you believe it? This guy actually took my ex-girlfriend.\" He told them the whole story. I'd occasionally give my perspec\u00ad tive, and he started getting really angry. He said, out of nowhere, \"Katya is not allowed in my house ever again.\" I said, \"It's my house too. You created this situation.\" He said, \"If I see her in the house again, I will end you.\" And I told him, \"Do what you have to do.\" MYSTERY: When we came back, Twyla had moved out of Project Hol\u00ad lywood, quit being my personal assistant, and moved in with Katya. TWYLA: Katya and I became friends. We bonded over talking about what kind of a person Mystery was. She asked me if I wanted to be her roommate. So I said, \"Right on.\" Page 396 380 HERBAL: Eventually, Mystery and I compromised. I said that Katya wouldn't spend more than half the week at the house. We shook hands and had an agreement. When I came back from Chicago, I had a week in Los Angeles before going to Boston for a family reunion. I stayed at Katya's apartment the entire week, just to be cool. KATYA: While Herbal was gone, I was helping Papa with his workshops. We finished late on Friday night, went to Mel's, and then came home and sat in the hot tub. I had to be up in the afternoon and look pretty. So he told me to sleep in Herbal's room. When I woke up, I saw Mystery. He asked me what I was doing in the house and I said, \"Papa and I were hanging out last night. We had fun.\" Then I said, \"I met one of your friends two nights ago.\" He said, \"Who did you meet?\" I said, \"Sima.\" And he freaked out. MYSTERY: When Katya told me in a very glib way that she had hung out with my ex-girlfriend from Toronto, I was furious. I lost Jen be\u00ad cause of her; I lost Twyla because of her; and now she was about to steal Sima, who was still an option. KATYA: He ran past me and kicked Herbal's door off the hinges and said, \"Where's Herbal?\" Then he ran back to his room, grabbed a framed photograph of Sima, and threw it at the wall over Herbal's bed. He said, \"I don't want you in this house when your boyfriend's not here.\" MYSTERY: I knew I couldn't reason with Katya and I couldn't touch her, so I decided to frighten her. I kicked the door and told her I wanted her out of the house. She said, \"This isn't your house.\" And I told her, \"I pay rent. I live here. You're a guest, and your host is not here. This is not acceptable.\" KATYA: Mystery started threatening that if he saw me in the house again, Herbal would get hurt. He threw candles around; he flipped Page 397 3B1 Herbal's mattress off the bed; he threw a flowerpot against the wall; and then he opened",
  "174": "Herbal's balcony door and started throwing my stuff into the driveway. He busted my bottle of Kama Sutra oil. I was so pissed. MYSTERY: I said, \"Don't come back here or else!\" She said back to me, \"Or else what? Are you going to kill me?\" And I said, \"No. I love you. I will punish your boyfriend if you come back. Tell him to control his girl.\" KATYA: I went upstairs to look for Papa, but he wasn't there. So I got in my car and drove to my apartment. Five minutes later, Papa called. He said, \"It's not Mystery's house. My name is on the lease, and you're my guest. I'm going to pick you up right now.\" So he snuck me back into the house. MYSTERY: Papa was breaking a cardinal rule. He was hiring my ex- girlfriend, who I trained, to be in his workshops, which was an idea he'd stolen from me. HERBAL (to Mystery, via e-mail): I have been told that my bedroom and personal belongings have been \"destroyed\" because Katya was at the house. I don't know exactly what destroyed means, but now I do not feel safe in my own house. You seem to believe that the world revolves around you and that everyone else should bend to your wishes. MYSTERY (to Herbal, via e-mail): I don't want Katya here and that is so final that there will be no need for you to reply to this e-mail in any way. Nor bring up the subject again, for it will arouse my anger so deeply that you will be thrown through glass. There will be no fur\u00ad ther warning. If she comes around when you return, I will instantly pound you\u2014it will be fast, hard, unexpected, merciless, and repeti\u00ad tive. If you come by and she isn't around, then we can safely live in peace under the same roof. Either way, our business relationship is, obviously, finished. TYLER DURDEN (via e-mail, to Mystery): You lost Katya for many rea\u00ad sons, but to me it appeared as though you emotionally leeched off Page 398 3B2 of her. You are needy and like a black hole sucking in attention. You can't handle not being the center of attention for even one minute. That is your tragic flaw. Don't offer your girls to your friends. Don't try to make a party girl into your girlfriend. And don't underestimate the consequences of bringing recently con\u00ad verted AFCs into our lifestyle. Page 399 My phone rang every day while I was in Miami. I'd pick it up, and it would be Mystery or Herbal or Katya or Twyla or Tyler Durden. I even received phone calls about Project Austin, which was also falling apart: The gas and electricity had been shut off because the bills hadn't been paid, and the bed\u00ad rooms were cluttered with candles, dirty clothing, and pornography. But the only person I really wanted to hear from was Lisa. When I returned to Project Hollywood, Herbal's room was in tatters. There were holes in his wall; his door was propped up precariously against its hinges; his mattress lay over his television set; and glass and dirt were strewn across the hardwood floor. From the perspective of a pickup artist, all Mystery was doing was strengthening Katya and Herbal's relationship by creating drama and a common enemy. But Mystery wasn't thinking like a pickup artist. He was unable to control himself. That night, the doorbell rang. When Mystery answered it, he found a well-muscled man in his twenties standing in the rain with an angry look on his face. Katya's car was parked in front of the house. \"I'm Katya's brother,\" the man told Mystery. \"I don't think so. I know her brother.\" \"Well,\" he said, stepping past Mystery and into the house. \"I heard you threatened to kill her. And that's not going to happen.\" \"I never threatened Katya.\" Mystery sized Katya's friend up. He was shorter than him but definitely stronger. \"I threatened Herbal.\" \"Well, if you do anything to her, I will personally crack your skull wide open.\" Mystery never responded well to provocation. Just like during our argu\u00ad ment in the car at the Trans-Dniester border, Mystery snapped. The veins in his neck leaped to attention; his face ripened; he grew an inch. \"You want to go?\"",
  "175": "Mystery yelled. \"Let's go then, because I'm ready to take this thing all the way.\" \"Fine,\" Katya's friend said. \"Then step outside. I don't want to get blood on the carpet.\" Page 400 384 \"No, let's do it right here. I want blood on the floor. I want something to remember you by.\" In the periphery of his vision, Mystery spotted a cluster of large rocks he'd brought back from the beach and painted into runestones. He reached for one, prepared to smash his adversary's head in, then quickly changed his mind. He took three giant strides to Herbal's already-decimated door and kicked it to the ground again. \"Come on then,\" Mystery yelled. \"I'm not making any apologies for what I'm about to do.\" He grabbed a bookshelf and pulled it over. Katya's friend saw the gleam of madness in Mystery's eyes\u2014and in a fight the insane generally have a competitive edge. \"You don't have to kick doors down and shit,\" he said, backing off. \"All I want is the dog, man. Katya sent me to get her dog.\" The guy scooped Lily into his arms, and Mystery paused and looked at him. The threat was gone. The Cortisol, the adrenaline, the testosterone\u2014all those hormones that were rushing through his body\u2014began to ebb. His brain returned to logical mode. \"Why didn't you say that in the first place instead of threatening me in my own home?\" The guy stood next to the door, befuddled, with Lily cradled in his arms. \"Do you need food for Lily?\" Mystery asked. \"Um,yes. I guess.\" Mystery walked to the kitchen, grabbed Lily's bag of dry food and sev\u00ad eral cans of wet food, and gave them to his would-be attacker. On the way out, the guy dropped some cans on the steps. Mystery bent down, picked them up, handed them to him, and then patted him on the back. \"Respect,\" he told Katya's friend, using the line we'd appropriated from Ali G to use in the field. I walked upstairs, collapsed on my bed, and stared at the ceiling. Why was I here? It wasn't just about my envy of Dustin anymore. Along the way, I had gotten caught up in the social network and bond\u00ad ing rituals of the community\u2014in the idea that we were the supermen of the future, the smoothest who would inherit the earth from the strong, the sole owners of the skeleton key to the female mind. I had moved in with these guys because I thought we had all the answers. I imagined working together to bring all the other areas of our lives up to a new Page 401 385 plateau, beyond just women. I hoped we would be greater than the than the sum of our parts. But rathter than creating a mutual support system, we had created Lord of the Flies. Something had to be done to resolve this. My faith in these guy\u2014and this community\u2014was hanging by a thread. Page 403 STEP 11 MANAGE EXPECTATIONS Page 404 NOT THAT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, BIT THAT, IN THE END, THERE WAS A CERTAIN SENSE OF ORDER THERE; SOMETHING WORTH LEARNING IN THAT NARROW DIARY OF MY MIND. \u2014ANNE SEXTON, \"For John, Who Begs Me Not To Enquire Further\" Page 405 Mystery and Herbal sac facing each other on opposite couches, their arms folded across their chests. It was not only a defensive position, but also a stubborn one. Between them stood Mystery's Krav Maga instructor and Roadking, a PUA who worked as a bodyguard. Herbal had refused to set foot in the house without someone there to protect him from Mystery. The other permanent residents\u2014Papa, Xaneus, Playboy, and me\u2014sat on a third couch perpendicular to them. Tyler Durden didn't attend because he claimed to be a guest, although he'd been living in Papa's closet for months now. We had called a house meeting to resolve the dispute between Mystery and Herbal once and for all. We allowed each to present his side of the story without interrup\u00ad tion. Mystery said he would not allow his ex-girlfriend to set foot in the house again. And Herbal said he would move out if his girlfriend couldn't come over. It took each of them half an hour to convey these simple points. \"Now, normally, I would just say that Herbal should move out if he wants to be",
  "176": "with Mystery's ex-girlfriend that badly,\" I said, trying to play the role of peacemaker that had been foisted on me. \"However, Mystery, you've damaged house property and threatened a tenant's well-being. You have neither apologized for your actions nor repaired the damages.\" Herbal's door was still lying on the floor, the dents were still in his wall, and his room still looked like a tornado had hit it. \"And it makes us very reluctant to re\u00ad ward bad behavior by letting you get your way.\" \"I purposely left Herbal's room like that as a demonstration of what I will do if I see Katya in this house again,\" Mystery said sullenly. \"It was a perfectly acceptable means of showing that I was willing to enforce my rules.\" One of the problems with the PUA community was that it presented in\u00ad flexible standards of behavior that men were supposed to follow in order to win a woman. And chief among them was the idea of being an alpha male. Page 406 390 The result was a bunch of men who'd been kicked around most of their lives trying to act like their former bullies, leading to immature behavior such as Mystery's. \"If I may say something?\" Roadking interjected. \"Herbal here broke an important rule.\" \"And what's that?\" Herbal asked. There was no anger or resentment in his voice; only the red rings around his eyes betrayed the emotion he felt. \"It's the rule of bros before hos,\" Roadking said. \"No,\" Mystery said. \"I'd like to agree, but sometimes it's hos before bros.\" Herbal cracked a smile for the first time that afternoon: He and Mys\u00ad tery actually saw eye to eye on something. Strip away the community bond and the seduction business interests that united us, and what was left? Six guys chasing after a limited subset of available women. Wars have been fought, world leaders shot, and tragedies wrought by males claiming territorial rights over the opposite sex. Perhaps we'd just been too blind to see that Project Hollywood was doomed from the start by the very pursuit that had brought it together. After three hours of go-nowhere debate\u2014during which Papa, oddly, didn't speak once\u2014we asked Mystery and Herbal to give us some privacy to talk amongst ourselves and come to a house decision. They both agreed to accept whatever we decided. When we entered Papa's room, there was a flurry of activity. Several fig\u00ad ures darted into his bathroom and shut the door. I hadn't seen his room in nearly a month. The carpet was barely visible beneath six convertible black foam chairs that had been unfolded into beds. On top of each was a pillow and bedding. Where were the people who slept here? Who were they? We folded the beds back into chairs, sat down, and prepared to reach a conclusion. That was when Papa spoke for the first time. \"I will not live in the same house as that guy,\" he said. \"Who?\" I asked. \"Mystery!\" Papa's hands trembled from either hatred or nervousness. He was a dif\u00ad ficult person to read. He hadn't been sarging in months, and much of the progress he'd made after working so hard to improve himself had disap- Page 407 391 peared. He was the same blank, introverted shell I had first met in Toronto. His passion was no longer pickup; it was Real Social Dynamics. Instead of going to seminars on meeting women, he spent most of his time flying around the country to marketing and business seminars. \"Mystery disrupts my workshops,\" Papa continued. His voice was dis\u00ad tant and monotone, echoing from somewhere deep inside his head. \"He damages the house. And I'm worried he's going to harm me.\" \"What are you talking about? He wouldn't do anything to you.\" \"I have nightmares that Mystery is coming into my room with a knife. I'm getting locks put on my doors because I'm scared he'll break in.\" \"That's ridiculous,\" I said. \"He's not going to hurt you. That's your own issue: You need to learn how to deal with aggression and confrontation rather than just avoiding everyone and trying to kick them out of the house.\" But no matter what I said to dissuade Papa, he",
  "177": "kept repeating the same sentence\u2014\"I will not live in the same house as that guy\"\u2014in a robotic voice, as if he'd been programmed to say it. \"Have you ever stopped to think,\" Playboy finally asked me, \"that the only reason you're defending Mystery is because he's your friend?\" Perhaps Playboy was right. I was giving Mystery special-circumstances treatment, because he had brought me into the community and because the house had been his idea. None of us would have been here without him. But he had screwed up. He had made his bed. I needed to consider what was best for the house. \"But,\" I said. \"I'd still like to find a way to solve this without anyone having to leave the house.\" \"We'll trust whatever you decide,\" Papa said. \"You're the house leader. Everyone looks up to you.\" I found it strange that Papa, who was so adamant about having Mys\u00ad tery leave, was putting the decision in my hands. For the next two and a half hours, we discussed possible compromises. The more we talked about it, the more complex the dilemma seemed. There was no solution that was go\u00ad ing to satisfy everyone: Papa wouldn't live in the house with Mystery. Mystery wouldn't live in the house with Katya. And Herbal wouldn't live in the house without Katya. Someone had to go. Page 408 392 \"All the problems in this house can be traced back to one source,\" Play\u00ad boy said firmly, \"and that source is Mystery.\" I looked at Xaneus. \"Do you agree with Playboy and Papa?\" I asked him. \"I do,\" he said. He too seemed to speak from somewhere deep in his skull, as if he weren't really present. He was turning as robotic as the rest of them. \"I think Mystery needs to go.\" Page 409 We called Mystery and Herbal into the room to give them our decision. They sat on the edge of the step leading up to Papa's bed. Having come up with the only possible compromise for a complicated dilemma, I was proud of myself\u2014mistakenly, it would turn out\u2014for exercising my newfound lead\u00ad ership skills in a Solomon-like manner. \"Herbal,\" I began. \"Katya will not be allowed in the house for two months. After that, if you're still dating her, she may return to the house.\" Herbal nodded. \"Mystery, you have two months to get over Katya and find yourself a new girlfriend. In addition, there will be a zero-tolerance policy for violence in this house. If you threaten anyone's life, attack anyone, or damage prop\u00ad erty, you will be asked to leave the house immediately.\" Mystery didn't nod. \"So basically you're saying you want me out of the house and that bitch gets to replace me,\" he snarled. \"Well,\" Playboy said. \"There's always the chance Herbal and Katya will break up in that time.\" \"I don't see that happening,\" Herbal said. Mystery threw his arms into the air. \"Well, then you guys are kicking me out.\" \"No,\" I said. \"We're giving you two months to come to grips with your emotions.\" I was trying to help him. But he refused to be helped. \"If you give me at least two weeks notice before you leave,\" Papa said, \"I'll refund your full deposit and find someone to fill the room.\" Papa was happy. He was getting his way. Mystery's forehead creased; his head twitched involuntarily. \"You real\u00ad ize,\" he said, \"that Papa is trying to get me out of the house because he's in competition with me. This is not about Mystery versus Herbal. It's about Mystery Method versus Real Social Dynamics. I gave Papa his entire busi\u00ad ness model. I told him to harness his sex drive and become a businessman. Page 410 394 He's even charging fifteen hundred dollars now for boot camps where he teaches my material.\" Mystery glared at Papa; Papa stared right through Mystery. \"And now that he doesn't need me anymore, he wants to move me out and turn my room into a twelve-person dorm.\" At the time, I thought Mystery was in denial, that he was still refusing to take responsibility for his actions. \"It didn't have to turn out like this,\" I told him. \"Every step of the way, you've made bad decisions, and now you have to live with them. We're not",
  "178": "even kicking you out. You're deciding to leave.\" Mystery folded his arms across his chest and looked at us disdainfully. \"Can't you see that the actions you think are alpha-male ways to solve a problem actually prevented you from getting the outcome you wanted?\" I continued. \"It was a tactic designed to keep Katya out of the house, and it worked,\" he maintained. \"She hasn't been back since.\" I lost my cool. It was time for him to wake up and take a good look at himself. \"You need some tough love,\" I said, raising my voice for the first time all meeting. \"You're the best illusionist I've ever seen, yet you haven't taken a single step toward your ninety-minute show\u2014or any show, for that matter\u2014since I've met you. Your pickup business is a mess, and your former students are raking in all the money that should be yours. As for your love life, ever since Katya, you've driven away every girl you've slept with. I would not recommend a girl ever dating you. You are a financial, mental, and emo\u00ad tional mess.\" With each sentence I felt like a weight was being lifted off my chest. \"You have nothing: no health, no wealth, and no relationships. And you have no one to blame but yourself.\" Mystery dropped his head into his hands. His shoulders started shak\u00ad ing. Big Mystery tears rolled out of his eyes. \"I'm a broken man,\" he cried. \"I'm broken.\" The wall of sophistry and self-deception that had been propping him up came tumbling down. \"What should I do?\" He looked at me. \"Tell me what to do.\" Tears began leaking out of my eyes. I couldn't help it. I turned and faced the wall so Herbal and Papa wouldn't see. The tears ran faster. Despite all of Mystery's flaws, I still cared about the guy. After two years in the se\u00ad duction community, I still didn't have a girlfriend, but for some reason I Page 411 395 had bonded with this big blubbering genius. Perhaps it was really shared emotion and experience that creates relationships, not seven hours of rou\u00ad tines followed by two hours of sex. \"You need therapy,\" I said. \"You need treatment or counseling or some\u00ad thing. You can't just keep doing this to yourself.\" \"I know,\" he said. His eyes filled with tears as viscous as mercury. He balled his hand into a fist and hit his head self-castigatingly. \"I know. I fucked up.\" Page 412 I walked out of Papa's room and left the house. I had a headache. It had been a long day. As I started down the hill to grab a burrito at Poquito Mas, a black Mer\u00ad cedes convertible whipped around the corner and began climbing the hill. Inside were two blondes. The car screeched to a halt in front of me, and a voice yelled my name from the driver's seat. It was Lisa. My heart skipped a beat. She wore a red Diesel jacket with a wide rainbow collar that made her look like a cross between a supermodel and a racecar driver. I was unshaven, wearing sweatpants, and frazzled from debating with my roommates all day. I felt so many emotions at once: embarrassment, excitement, resent\u00ad ment, fear, joy. I didn't think I was ever going to see her again. \"We're going to get a drink,\" Lisa yelled. \"Do you want to join us?\" \"What are you doing here?\" I tried to keep my cool and appear unfazed by her sudden reappearance. \"Going to the Whiskey Bar.\" \"Didn't you just pass it?\" \"Yeah. I came by to ask you to go with us. Do you have a problem with that?\" A touch of attitude. I still liked her. She was a challenge. She didn't let any sarcasm, neg, or cocky funny get past her without a verbal smackdown. \"Let me change,\" I said, \"and I'll meet you there.\" I slipped on a pair of Levi's Red jeans with fake cat scratches down the front and a military-collared button-down shirt I'd bought in Australia, and ran down the hill to join them. I was anxious to talk to Lisa and find out why she'd disappeared after Atlanta. But when I arrived, Lisa and Sam were at a table with two stocky, heavily tattooed rockers. They were the type of guys I had imagined Lisa dating. I sat between them, dwarfed by ink and hair",
  "179": "dye. As they gossiped about local rock scenesters I neither knew nor cared about, an overwhelming anxiety took hold of my body. I didn't want to Page 413 MANAGE EXPECTATIONS 397 make small talk or pretend to enjoy it. I wanted to be alone with Lisa. I wanted to connect with her. When the first drip of sweat rolled down my forehead, I jumped up. I couldn't take it. \"I'll be right back,\" I said. I needed to sarge\u2014not because I wanted to pick up women, but because I wanted to get into a positive state and talka\u00ad tive mood. Otherwise I was going to just crack sitting there so awkwardly. As I ordered a drink at the bar, I smelled lilacs behind me. I turned around to see two women in black evening dresses. \"Hey guys, let me get your opinion on something,\" I began, with a little less enthusiasm than usual. \"Let me guess,\" one of the women said. \"You have a friend whose girl\u00ad friend is jealous because he still talks to his ex from college.\" \"Like, every guy keeps asking us that,\" her friend said. \"What's the deal?\" I grabbed my Jack and Coke and shuffled out to the smoking patio\u2014 the site of my pickup battle with Heidi Fleiss. With some trepidation, I de\u00ad livered the spells opener to a two-set sitting on a bench. Fortunately, they hadn't heard it. \"Hey,\" I said afterward. I really wasn't feeling it, but I wanted to push myself to be talkative. \"How long have you guys known each other?\" \"About ten years,\" one of the girls said. \"I could tell. I have to give you guys the best friends test.\" \"Oh, we know that one already,\" she said politely. It had finally happened: The Sunset Strip was sarged out. The community had grown large and reckless; too many competing businesses were teaching the same material. And we had saturated more than just Los Angeles. PUAs in San Diego, Montreal, New York, San Fran\u00ad cisco, and Toronto had been reporting the same problem lately: They were running out of fresh girls to sarge. I walked back to Lisa and her friends. \"I'm wiped out,\" I told Lisa. \"I'm going to head home. But I'm driving to Malibu tomorrow to surf. You and Sam should join me. It'll be fun.\" She looked up at me, and we connected for the first time all evening. For three extraordinary seconds, the rest of the club disappeared. \"Yeah, all right,\" she said. \"Sounds cool.\" \"Great. Meet me at the house at noon.\" Connection over. Page 414 338 When I returned home from the Whiskey Bar, Isabel was waiting for me. I was never going to get any sleep. \"Didn't I tell you to call first before dropping by?\" I asked. \"I left you a message.\" There was nothing wrong with Isabel. Five years ago, I would have given up writing for a year just to sleep with a girl like that once. But she of\u00ad fered nothing. She was all holes: ears to listen to me, a mouth to talk at me, and a vagina to squeeze orgasms out of me. We weren't a team; we were just a distraction for each other, a way to feel less lonely for a few hours in a big, uncaring world. We never had conversations; we had conversations, where we just filled empty space with words. At least, that's what I thought. But sometimes, simply through the act of having sex with a man, especially if that man is a little more emotionally distant than she'd like him to be, a woman can develop feelings. She can start wanting more. \"Are you still seeing other girls?\" Isabel asked in the morning, rolling on top of me and looking aggressively into my eyes. It was a loaded question with only one right answer. I gave her the wrong one\u2014the honest one. \"Well, I met a girl named Lisa, who I'm devel\u00ad oping feelings for.\" \"Well, you're going to have to choose between her and me.\" In the past, I used to fall for ultimatums. But I'd since learned that ulti\u00ad matums are expressions of powerlessness, empty threats designed to try to influence a situation someone has no control over. \"Just by asking me to make that choice,\" I said, \"you're setting yourself up to be the loser.\" She dropped her head onto my shoulder and cried. I felt bad for",
  "180": "her. But that's all I felt. An hour after she left, Sam and Lisa arrived. Mystery sat at the com\u00ad puter, typing furiously. He looked up at Lisa, who was wearing a Juicy Cou\u00ad ture linen pullover with the hood over her head, and tried to neg her. \"What kind of get-up is that?\" he asked. It was the only way he knew how to relate to a beautiful woman. Lisa slowly scanned Mystery's get-up. He was wearing a robe, boxer shorts, black toenail polish, and slippers. She gave him a withering look and sneered, deadpan, \"Right back at ya, babe.\" Lisa was neg-proof. Next to her, other girls seemed like incomplete hu\u00ad man beings. For most of their childhood, females are conditioned to act Page 415 399 subservient to male authority figures. Once they grow up, a certain subset of them\u2014many of whom end up in Los Angeles\u2014move through the world psychologically stunted, constantly dumbing themselves down in the pres\u00ad ence of the opposite sex. They believe that the techniques they used to ma\u00ad nipulate their fathers will work just as well on the rest of the world, and often they're right. But Lisa wasn't a doormat designed by the expectations and desires of the men in her life. She lived the advice that most women hypocritically give to men; She wasn't afraid to be herself. Mystery was silent for once. He cleared his throat; announced, a little too loudly, \"I'm busy\"; then turned away to continue typing. I was sure he was posting in Mystery's Lounge, letting off steam after the previous day's house meeting. Before we left for the beach, I showed Sam and Lisa the photos I had taken the first night Lisa slept over, when we had played dress-up with the wigs. \"Look at that,\" Sam said when she saw the photo of Lisa and me star\u00ad ing into each other's eyes, just before we didn't kiss. \"I've never seen Lisa look so happy.\" \"Yeah,\" Lisa said, her lips spreading into a toothy smile. \"I guess you're right.\" Sam ran upstairs to use my bathroom while Lisa and I loaded the surf\u00ad boards into the back of the limousine, which doubled as my surf car. As we drove to Malibu, I noticed Sam leaning over the seat divider to whisper something to Lisa, which wiped the smile off her face in an instant. \"What is it?\" I asked. They looked at each other hesitantly. \"What?\" I persisted. I really wanted to know. I was sure it was about me, and I was sure it wasn't positive. \"It's not important,\" Sam said. \"Just girl talk.\" \"Urn, okay.\" When I surfed in the past, I usually hung out close to the shore, riding the smaller waves while the more experienced surfers paddled further out for the big ones. I thought I was better than them because I got more waves. But after helping Sam and Lisa get comfortable on their boards, I paddled out with the expert surfers to try and catch a big wave. As I waited, I looked on with envy as the surfers on the inside\u2014closer to shore\u2014caught wave after wave. After twenty minutes, the water finally swelled Page 416 400 behind me and I began to paddle. As a wall of blue grew in my peripheral vi\u00ad sion, my body tensed: I wondered if I could handle a wave this big. It grabbed my board with a crack, like pealing thunder, and I leapt to my feet. The blue stretched far overhead. I cut through the open face all the way to the top of the wave and maneuvered to shore. I felt alive, exhilarated, ecstatic. I didn't know I could do it before: I didn't think I had the knowledge and the skill to take a wave like that. For the first time since junior high, I felt like writing poetry. As I triumphantly carried my board to the beach, I realized it was time, with girls, to take the big waves and stop messing with the mushy little in\u00ad side ones, to go for the best rather than the most. I deserved it. When we returned home, I pulled Lisa aside. \"I'd like to take you out for sushi on Saturday,\" I said. It was so AFC of me. I was asking her out on a date. She hesitated for a moment, as if she were deciding the best way to let me down easy. She pursed her lips and squinted.",
  "181": "Then, finally, she spoke. \"Okay, I guess.\" \"You guess?\" I couldn't remember the last time I'd asked a girl on a date, and she was giving me attitude about it? \"No, it's just that \" She stopped herself. \"Never mind. Yeah, I'd love to go. I was wondering when you were finally going to ask.\" \"That's better. I'll pick you up at eight.\" The girls left, and I went to the kitchen to saute a chicken breast. The remains of countless meals made by scores of guests had congealed into a black crust that coated the stovetop. As I waited for my food to cook, Tyler Durden came in through the patio door, wearing running shoes and a Walkman. He lifted up his T-shirt, examined a roll of baby fat on his belly, and took his Walkman headphones off. \"Hey, man, I heard what happened with Mystery,\" he said. \"I'm really sorry about how things turned out. Let me know if I can do anything to help convince him to stay in the house.\" \"He's very stubborn. I doubt there's anything you can do.\" \"If he leaves, there's no Project Hollywood anymore,\" he went on. \"I guess it would sort of become the RSD mansion.\" \"I guess so.\" I scooped the chicken onto a plate and grabbed a fork and knife. \"By the way. I bought a Style shirt on Melrose today. It looks just like something you would wear. I have to show it to you.\" Page 417 401 \"That's great, but kind of weird.\" There was something I'd been mean\u00ad ing to discuss with Tyler Durden for a while now. \"I'd like to talk to you about paying a small rent or part of the utilities. You've been living here for months now, and we made a rule the day we moved in that long-term guests should contribute to the house.\" \"Sure, man,\" he said. \"Just bring it up with Papa.\" His words were agreeable, but not his body language. He shifted his head uncomfortably while he spoke, as if he didn't know where to look, then wheeled around and left. He always seemed to go unnaturally out of his way to make sure he wasn't actively involved in any house issue, drama, or meeting. Behind his smile I sensed something\u2014not unlike what I'd felt when I'd kissed his girl in Las Vegas. By asking him to pay rent, I'd become a threat to him. I took my food to the office area of the house, turned on my computer, and checked Mystery's Lounge. I wanted to read the masterpiece Mystery had been so furiously working on that afternoon. Page 418 MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Mystery Moves Out AUTHOR: Mystery I will likely be moving out of Project Hollywood next month because it is no longer a suitable place for me. The invasive social environment has made liv\u00ad ing here uncomfortable. As far as lifestyle goes, Project Hollywood is a bust. I don't see living here to be a positive experience for anyone. If and when my overpriced bedroom is made available, your unsavory roommates (Save Style) will, at some point, un\u00ad dermine your happiness. This is something they have demonstrated on more than one occasion. In my specific case, aside from the issues with having a competing busi\u00ad ness running out of the same home I live in (one of many breaches in trust be\u00ad tween Papa and me], house members think that it's appropriate to intervene in my private sex life. This is an intolerable situation for me. I've been told that my ex-girlfriend, who has demonstrated numerous times that she is untrustworthy, will be allowed back in the house in two months. If she comes back (which Papa hopes), then this forces me out of the house because I do not want such a toxic person near my friends or me. Un\u00ad less the restraining order Katya is threatening to file against me keeps her out of my house, such involvement in my personal affairs will likely cause irrevocable bitterness. As for those who say I need psychological help, the greatest solution to de\u00ad pression is not paying some stranger to listen to you or taking drugs, which is just a short-term fix for when things hit rock bottom. The long-term fix is a positive so\u00ad cial environment filled with friends who will listen and share",
  "182": "your challenges. That is what Project Hollywood was supposed to be. If anyone would like to talk to me openly about the situation and why I do not endorse living here, call me. I don't want anyone else to get ripped off and hurt as I have been. Know the cul\u00ad ture before making any decision to move here. Page 419 403 'Nuff said. \u2014Mystery P.S. If I move out, I will be selling my bed. I've only slept with ten girls on it so it's very clean. It's a California king-sized bed. The price is $900 cash and does not include comforter or sheets. Here is a list of who's been bedded on the bed: 1. Joanne the stripper 2. Mary the blonde model 3. The hot bartender from the Spider Club 4. Sima the ex-girlfriend from Toronto 5. Katya the *&%! 6. Gabby the gabber 7. Jen the nineteen-year-old hottie 8. Vision's cousin (I know, but I still enjoyed her) 9. Twyla the personal assistant 10. The six-foot tall model I scared away (third base only) I think that's everyone. It's a great bed. Firm. Eleven happy people. MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014Mystery Meets His Future Wife AUTHOR: Mystery I have met my future wife. And I have decided not to tell you about her. She is that important and that classy. She is my dream girl (at least I think she is so far) Page 420 4D4 Unlike the last girl, I will not make her public. This time I will start from scratch and not undermine my relationship by sharing it with you guys. I will be more loyal to her than to you because the bros before hos ethic only applies if you think of the girl as a ho. Here is all you need to know: I met her briefly when I was in Chicago, do\u00ad ing my last workshop with Herbal. I met her for seven minutes and then number- closed. We have spoken on the phone since for hours and hours. I love her personality. And, yes, body-and face-wise, she is a 10. I have talked with her mom on the phone, and she likes me too. This girl is coming to Los Angeles to visit me for a week. I bought her a flight. My family will be arriving the same week and they will meet. Though we have only been in each other's presence for seven minutes, I predict that I will marry her, live with her, and possibly have kids with her. How is that for a prediction, huh? From the world's greatest pickup artist. You won't see her winging my workshops because I will refrain from ex\u00ad ploiting her unless she wants to help out for shits and giggles. She is untouch\u00ad able to this paltry gang of misfits. She isn't a party girl like the last five girls. She may look like one (mmm) but she is perfection, at least to me. My friends will meet her soon. As for all the other PUAs, stay away from her because you know I bite. Love, Mystery Page 421 Mystery sulked through the trash-strewn house in his robe, telling anyone who would listen about the former student who was stealing his business and the bitch who ruined his life. Any attempt to get him into therapy was dismissed with a long-winded explanation of how his emotions and actions were evolutionarily justified. The window of vulnerability and honesty that had opened when he broke down in the house meeting had closed. His frame had reasserted itself; his mind had rebuilt the tortuous walls separat\u00ad ing rationalization from reality. Though he wasn't upset with me, I felt guilty. The compromise that was effectively pushing him out of the house had been my decision. So much for my Solomon-like wisdom. To make matters worse, Katya was twisting the knife. She'd given her landlord sixty days notice, and planned to move into Herbal's room once she was allowed back in the house. Her revenge, then, was complete. That Friday, I drove with Mystery to pick up his sister, mother, and nieces from the airport. They piled into the back of the limo and sur\u00ad rounded him with the love he so desperately craved. We then headed to the United Airlines terminal. Mystery had one more guest coming in for the week: Ania. She was the girl he'd met in Chicago, the one he'd claimed online would be",
  "183": "the future Mrs. Mystery, the ultimate rebound. One of Mystery's specialties in sarging was what he called hired guns, such as bartenders, strippers, shot girls, and waitresses. Ania was a coatcheck girl at the Chicago Crobar. We pulled outside the terminal and waited. \"Get ready to meet my fu\u00ad ture wife,\" Mystery announced to his family. \"Don't scare her away like the last one,\" his mom chuckled. She seemed to have learned that the secret to surviving the stresses her husband and children had put on her was to never take anyone or anything too seriously. Life was an in-joke between her and God. We recognized Ania the moment the automatic doors opened, reveal\u00ad ing a short woman with bottle-blonde hair, a bosom disproportionate to Page 422 406 her body, and a shrunken-apple face that betrayed, like Patricia and Katya before her, Eastern European origins. Mystery greeted her, grabbed her bags, and brought her to the limo. Out\u00ad side of a meek \"hello,\" Ania didn't say a word during the entire trip home. In\u00ad stead, she sat passively and listened to Mystery. She was just his type. She may not have been a party girl like Katya, but Ania came with her own baggage, which arrived unexpectedly at the airport the next day. His name was Shaun. On Saturday we discovered Shaun standing outside the house, dialing Ania's cell phone every five minutes. Ania had never told Mystery she was engaged. And, clearly, she had never told her fiance she was flying to Los Angeles to visit a pickup artist she had met at work. Shaun had evidently checked her voice mail, discovered messages from Mystery, and decided to fly to LA. to confront his rival. The irony wasn't lost on Mystery. \"I understand what Shaun's going through,\" he said. \"I'm like Herbal to him. He wants to kill me and take his woman back.\" He paused for a moment and adjusted his posture into what would have been an alpha male pose if he had any pectorals. \"I'm going out there to talk to him.\" As Mystery swaggered outside, I waited in the living room with his sis\u00ad ter and mother. We sat on the upholstery\u2014so filthy now even the stains were stained\u2014that was the backdrop to the tears, girls' bottoms, and house meetings that had been consuming my life for months. I felt a need to es\u00ad cape this trap I had set for myself; this trap Mystery kept setting for himself; the traps we all constantly set for ourselves, over and over, and never seem to learn from. \"You realize,\" I told them, \"that Mystery is just building himself up for another fall with this girl.\" \"Yes,\" his mom said. \"He thinks it's all about the girls, but it's not. It's about his low self-esteem.\" Only a mother could reduce a person's entire ambition and raison d'\u00eatre to the one basic insecurity fueling it all. \"What worries me is the violence,\" I said. \"He's starting to think that vi\u00ad olence is a solution to these problems, and it's a dangerous way of thinking.\" \"Butting heads with someone never works,\" his mom said. \"I always say that you don't have to do the direct approach. You can just go around be\u00ad cause there's always a back way.\" \"Now I know where he got Mystery Method from.\" In three sentences. Page 423 407 his mother had unintentionally summarized Mystery's entire approach to meeting women: the indirect method. Martina knitted her eyebrows and shifted her weight on the couch. \"His depressions get worse every time,\" she sighed. \"He was never violent before.\" \"Well, I remember one time when he was angry, he slammed a door and killed his pet rat,\" his mother said. \"But I never saw him get mad about any\u00ad thing else. Even when the cat died, he just said, 'That's life.'\" \"What I think is happening,\" Martina said, \"is that with our father gone, he's starting to realize that Dad was never as bad as he remembered. So now he's allowing himself to be more like Dad.\" I reflected back on my conversation with Mystery at the Trans-Dniester border. He'd made his dad out to be a monster. \"So your dad wasn't as bad as Mystery always said?\"",
  "184": "\"The problem is that they were too similar,\" Martina explained. \"Dad could take over any room he walked into. He was very charismatic but also very stubborn. They never got along. Mystery would always do things to antagonize Dad. And Dad, instead of acting like an adult, would blow up at him.\" \"We'd have to put them on opposites sides of the table,\" Mystery's mom cut in, \" and if one so much as looked at the other wrong, a fight would break out.\" \"And now that Dad's gone,\" Martina said, \"Mystery needs someone to take all his anger out on. So Katya has taken the place of his father. She's become the villain responsible for all the messed-up emotions he's feeling.\" Now was my chance to bring up the question I'd wanted to ask ever since Mystery's breakdown in Toronto, the question that would free me of the inexplicable obligation I felt to save him from himself. \"So what do we do?\" We talked it through for a half hour. The answer, Martina finally de\u00ad cided, was to let him run free; to give him a chance to make something of his talent and genius; to give him time to quest after two 10s who will love him as much as they love each other. And to hope that he made some progress to\u00ad ward his life goals before the next crash, or the crash after that, or whichever crash would be so destructive he'd have to return home for good. He was walking on quicksand with helium balloons in his hands. In that respect, he was like all of us, except the air in his balloons was escaping faster. Page 424 408 We cut our discussion short when Mystery strode into the kitchen. \"Done,\" he said. \"I had a long talk with Ania's fianc\u00e9 at Mel's. I told him it was too late for him to fix things with her. Ania is now my girlfriend, and we are in love with each other. This is turning out to be the best pickup in the history of Mystery Method.\" Martina gave me a knowing glance. Mystery's mother crossed her arms over her chest and chuckled to herself. He slammed a tape recorder down on the kitchen counter. \"I recorded the whole conversation,\" he said. \"Do you want to hear it?\" \"No,\" I told him. I'd had enough drama. Besides, I had a date with Lisa to keep. Page 425 I picked Lisa up at 8:00 PM and took her to a Japanese restaurant called Katana. It was one of the toughest dinners of my life. We'd spent so much time together already that I literally had no more material left. I was forced to be myself. \"There's something I've been meaning to ask you,\" I said as the heat lamps on the restaurant patio scalded our scalps and the sake warmed our stomachs. The question had been giving me insomnia for weeks. \"What happened to you after Atlanta? We had plans and you broke them.\" \"You were rude on the phone,\" she said. \"And I didn't think we had def\u00ad inite plans anyway.\" So it had been her version of cat-string theory, punish\u00ad ing me for bad behavior. \"I was being cocky funny. I wanted to see you.\" \"Whatever. You were rude. You were being too-cool-for-school and so laid-back and aloof about things that it was a turnoff. I thought, 'I can get anybody, and all of a sudden this guy is acting like Mr. Cool?'\" As we talked, I tried to figure out why I liked this girl so much, why af\u00ad ter meeting so many people she had become my obsession. A cynical part of me said I was simply falling for the female equivalent of the tactics we use. The secret to making someone think they're in love with you is to occupy their thoughts, and that's what Lisa had done with me. She had blown me off and rebuffed me physically while stringing me along with just enough encouragement to keep me chasing her. On the other hand, I wasn't a plower. If a woman I didn't care about had played this hard to get, I would have given up long ago. Of course, it was also possible that my obsession came from a misogynist, alpha-male streak I'd accidentally contracted as a side effect of sarging. Lisa was fiercely independent, someone I looked up to rather than down at. So perhaps the caveman in me just wanted to sleep",
  "185": "with her and, thus, conquer her. And then there was always the remote possibility that she had managed to touch a part of me that I kept hidden from everyone, even myself. It was a part of me that wanted to stop thinking, to stop searching, to stop worry- Page 426 41D ing about what everyone thought of me and just let go and be comfortable and free and in the moment, the way I felt surfing that big wave in Malibu. And every now and then, when Lisa and I both dropped our defenses, I felt like that with her. I felt alone, together. We drove back to my house. Lisa slipped into a white T-shirt and box\u00ad ers, and we lay in bed as we had so many times before\u2014under the covers, on separate pillows, heads turned toward each other, but no part of our bodies touching. I wanted to continue our conversation from dinner. I wasn't trying to seduce her anymore. I just needed answers. \"So what made you drive up the hill the other day to see me again?\" \"While you were gone, I realized how much I missed you.\" I loved watching her lips part over her front teeth when she talked. It made me think of salmon on rice. \"My friends were making fun of me because I was counting down the days until you came home. I actually went grocery shop\u00ad ping while you were gone so I could cook you food. I don't know why.\" She hesitated and smiled, as if she were offering information she'd never planned to divulge. \"I bought a fresh piece of swordfish and had to throw it away because it went bad.\" A warm flush of confidence filled my chest. So I still had a chance with this girl. \"But it's too late,\" she said. \"The window was open with me, and you blew it.\" David DeAngelo would have said to go cocky funny here. Ross Jeffries would have said not to buy into her frame. Mystery would have said to pun\u00ad ish her. But I had to ask: \"How did I blow it?\" \"First off, you didn't call me when you came home from Miami. I had to go to you.\" \"Hold on. I thought you were blowing me off. You never even called while I was away.\" \"Well, your voice mail said you were out of town and you weren't re\u00ad turning calls, so I didn't leave a message.\" \"Yeah, but I would have returned your call. I wanted to hear from you.\" \"Then you came to the Whiskey Bar and hardly talked. And the last straw was when we went to your house to go surfing. I told Sam I was start\u00ad ing to like you again and she said, 'Get over it. When I went up to his room to use the bathroom, I found a used condom on the floor.'\" Page 427 411 My brain leaped up and slapped itself. I had been careless: I'd forgotten to throw away the condom I'd used with Isabel. So that's what Sam and she were whispering about in the car on the way to Malibu. \"So then why did you agree to go out with me tonight?\" \"You asked me out on a proper date. And you were a little nervous, so I figured you must really be into me.\" I propped myself up on the pillows. I was about to say the most AFC thing of my life. \"Let me tell you something. The pickup artists have a word they call one-iris. It's a disease that people get when they become obsessed with just one girl. And they never end up with this girl because they get too nervous around her and scare her away.\" \"So?\" she asked. \"So,\" I said. \"You're my one-itis.\" We were looking each other in the eyes now. I could see hers sparkle. I knew mine were sparkling. It was time to kiss her. There were no lines, no routines, no evolution phase-shift\u2014I'd tried them all unsuccessfully anyway. I leaned in. She leaned in. Her eyes closed. My eyes closed. Our lips met. It was just like I'd always thought a kiss was supposed to begin. For hours, we lay there making out and dissecting the connections and misunderstandings of the past few weeks. While Lisa slept in the morning, I crept downstairs with my phone book. I called Nadia and Hie and Susanna and Isabel and the Jessicas and every FB and MLTR and other acronym I was seeing and told them I had started spending time with someone I wanted to be faithful to. \"So you're",
  "186": "choosing her over me?\" Isabel asked angrily. \"It's not an intellectual choice.\" \"Is she better in bed or something?\" \"I don't know. We've only kissed.\" \"So you made out with some girl,\" she said, with a weak attempt at a cruel laugh, \"and you want to get rid of me now.\" \"It's not that I want to get rid of you. I'd still like to see you, but as a friend.\" I could hear the word pierce her heart like a dagger, as it had my own heart so many times before I'd joined the community. \"But I love you.\" How could she love me? She needed to go fuck a dozen other guys to get over her one-itis. Page 428 412 \"I'm sorry,\" I said. And I was. There is a downside to casual sex: Sometimes it stops being casual. Peo\u00ad ple develop a desire for something more. And when one person's expec\u00ad tations don't match the other person's, then whoever holds the highest expectations suffers. There is no such thing as cheap sex. It always comes with a price. I had violated one of Ross Jeffries's only ethical rule of seduction: Leave her better than you found her. Page 429 Steam rose from the water into the starless L.A. sky as Mystery and I sat op\u00ad posite each other in the Jacuzzi. He draped one pale arm around the edge of the hot tub, and with the other took a birdlike sip from a glass that con\u00ad tained an orange liquid and ice cubes. It seemed like a cocktail, which was strange because Mystery never drank alcohol. \"I gave Papa my notice,\" he said. \"I'm officially moving out next month.\" He was abandoning me, just like he had during his breakdown in Toronto. Now I would be stuck living with the happy couple who had forced him out and the clone army being built in Papa's room, \"But you're letting your enemies win,\" I said, picking a cigarette butt out of the Jacuzzi and dropping it into an empty glass. \"Just stay here and hold your ground. Katya wouldn't dare set foot in the house if you were here. Make a stand. Don't leave me alone with these guys.\" \"No. The anger and resentment I have is very great\u2014great enough for me to move out so that I don't have to see them ever again.\" He took another small swallow from his glass. \"What's that you're drinking, by the way?\" I asked. \"It's a screwdriver. I think I feel a little tipsy. You know, I've never been drunk before. I always avoided it because I didn't like my father. But now, with him gone, I figure it's okay to try it.\" \"Well, dude, now is a bad time to start. You're unstable enough as it is. You don't need to add alcohol to the mix.\" \"I enjoy it.\" As usual, I was wasting my breath. He took another sip, with a flourish this time, as if he were doing some\u00ad thing glamorous and cool. \"So Isabel stopped by here looking for you last night,\" he said. \"That's annoying. I tried to be clear with her about Lisa.\" He leaned forward, stirring the foam in the water with the bottom of his glass. \"You haven't even had sex with Lisa yet. So why not just have Is\u00ad abel on the side? It's a shame to lose a body like that.\" Page 430 414 \"No way, dude. I want to do this right. I don't want to lie in bed next to Lisa, feeling guilty for something I can't tell her about. It will break the trust we have.\" I leaned over the edge of the Jacuzzi and dipped my hand into the pool. It was just as warm as the hot tub. Someone had left the heat on again. Our gas bill was going to be astronomical \"Do you know the story of the frog and the scorpion?\" Mystery asked. \"No, but I love analogies.\" I jumped into the pool and treaded water as Mystery leaned over the edge of the hot tub and recited the story. \"One day, a scorpion stood on the side of a stream and asked a frog to carry it to the other side. 'How do I know you won't sting me?' the frog asked. 'Because if I sting you, I'll drown,' the scorpion said. \"The frog thought about it and realized that the scorpion was right. So he put the scorpion on his back and started ferrying him. But midway across the stream, the scorpion plunged its stinger into the frog's back. As they both began to drown,",
  "187": "the frog gasped,'Why?'\" \"The scorpion replied, 'Because it is my nature.'\" Mystery took a triumphant sip of his screwdriver, then fixed his gaze on me as I floated in the pool beneath him. He spoke slowly and deliber\u00ad ately, like the Mystery who'd first told me to snap and shed the boring skin of Neil Strauss. \"It is your nature,\" he continued. \"You are a pickup artist now, You are Style. You've bitten from the apple of knowledge. You cannot go back to the way you were before.\" \"Well, dude.\" I took a couple strokes backward. \"That's very cynical talk from a guy who's talking about marrying and having children with a girl he just met.\" \"We're poly amorous,\" he said. \"As a result, we have to cheat on our girl\u00ad friends. And if that threatens our relationships, so be it.\" He emptied his drink and held his temples, as if fighting off a dizzy spell. \"Never underesti\u00ad mate the power of denial.\" \"No.\" I couldn't look at him. I wasn't going to let him ruin this. \"I don't need any more advice.\" I climbed out of the pool, threw a towel over my shoulders, and walked into the living room. Xaneus, Playboy, and Tyler Durden were sitting there. As soon as I entered, they walked up to Papa's room without even acknowl\u00ad edging my presence. It was odd behavior, but nothing unexpected after liv\u00ad ing in Project Hollywood this long. Page 431 415 I went up to my room, showered, and paged through a copy of the me\u00ad dieval legend Parsifal I had recently bought. People often read books to search for themselves and find someone who agrees with them. And, right now, the nature of Parsifal agreed with me a lot more than the nature of the scorpion. As I interpreted the legend, it's the story of a sheltered mother's boy who meets some knights and decides he wants to be just like them. So he goes off into the world, has a series of adventures, and progresses from leg\u00ad endary fool to legendary knight. The country, at the time, has become a wasteland because the grail king (who guards the holy grail) has been wounded. And it just so happens that Parsifal is led to the grail castle, where he sees the king in terrible pain. As a compassionate human being, he wants to ask, \"What is wrong?\" And, ac\u00ad cording to legend, if someone pure of heart asks that question of the king, he will be healed and the blight on the land will be lifted. However, Parsifal does not know this. And as a knight he has been trained to observe a strict code of conduct, which includes the rule of never asking questions or speaking unless he is addressed first. So he goes to bed without talking to the king. In the morning, he wakes to discover that the grail castle has disappeared. He has blown his chance to save king and country by obeying his training instead of his heart. Unlike the scorpion, Parsifal had a choice. He just made the wrong one. When I walked through the living room to get a drink from the kitchen, I saw Mystery nursing another cocktail in front of the TV. He was watching a video of The Karate Kid and crying. \"I never had a Mr. Miyagi,\" he sobbed, wiping tears off his reddened cheeks. He was drunk. \"My dad didn't teach me anything. All I wanted was a Mr. Miyagi.\" I suppose we were all searching for someone to teach us the moves we needed to win at life, the knightly code of conduct, the ways of the alpha- male. That's why we found each other. But a sequence of maneuvers and a system of behavior would never fix what was broken inside. Nothing would fix what was broken inside. All we could do was embrace the damage. Page 432 Lisa and I spent the next day together, and the day after that, and the day af\u00ad ter that. I kept worrying that I was going to ruin it, that we were spending too much time with each other, that she was going to get tired of me. Rick H. had always said, \"Give her the gift of missing you.\" But we couldn't seem to part. \"You are so perfect for me,\" she said as we lay in my bed for the fourth night in a row. \"I've never had sex with a guy I liked this much",
  "188": "before. I'm afraid I'll get attached.\" Beneath that tough exterior, she was scared. All her push-pull wasn't a pre-planned psychological tactic; it was her heart warring with her head. Perhaps the reason she'd been so reluctant to open up was that she was pro\u00ad tecting something fragile inside. Like me, she was afraid to actually feel something for somebody else\u2014to love, to be vulnerable, to give someone else control over her happiness and well-being. When I slept with all those other girls, I just had sex with them once a night\u2014and, if I liked them enough, a second time in the morning. But something amazing happened with Lisa when we had sex for the first time. After I had an orgasm, it didn't go down. It remained, as the old Extramask would say, rock-hard and luscious. I did it with her a second time. \"Feel it,\" I said afterward. It was still ready to go. We did it a third and a fourth time that night, and it never went soft. I couldn't understand it. My dick, which I had thought was a completely mindless animal desperate to stick itself in any hole, actually responded to emotion. It had feelings too. And it wasn't just built-up anticipation. It stayed up through three or four orgasms every time Lisa and I made love. We fucked in cars, in alleys, in restaurant bathrooms, and in the vending- machine room in a hotel hallway, where a maintenance man caught us and tried to extort twenty dollars from me. When I'd gone impotent in the bathroom with the porn star, perhaps it didn't have anything to do with the whiskey. My body was responding to Page 433 417 the lack of emotional foreplay: I neither cared about nor really desired her. And I'm sure she felt the same. It was just entertainment. Sex with Lisa was not entertainment. It was not about validation and ego-gratification, as with all those pickups I'd been so proud of. It was about creating a vacuum where nothing else existed except the two of us and our passion. It made the rest of existence seem like a distraction. And then, one afternoon, just when I'd forgotten all about her, Court\u00ad ney returned. She pulled up to the house in a limo and leaped out, looking radiant in a blue dress and white shawl. \"There's blood flow to my pussy again!\" was the first thing she ex\u00ad claimed. \"Did you land that director you were chasing?\" I asked. \"No. I got a new man in New York. And it's going to be his fault for making me a slut, because now I want it all the time.\" She danced toward me, light like a ballerina. \"Well,\" I said. \"We had a bet about your director crush.\" \"That's right. I guess I lost.\" \"So that means I get to choose the middle name of your next child.\" She smiled and stared at me expectantly, as if I were supposed to just select one on the spot. I shuffled through a list of possible names in my head. \"How about Style?\" I finally decided. \"I'm going to be retiring the name anyway, so I might as well pass it on.\" I thought about the idea for a moment. It was re\u00ad ally a stupid moniker. Then again, her daughter's middle name is Bean. She squealed and gave me a bone-crushing hug. \"You know, I've found you sexually intriguing these last few months,\" she said. I swallowed and prepared to tell her about Lisa. Before I opened my mouth, however, she continued. \"But I heard all about you and Lisa. I think that's great. So some good came out of having me in the house after all?\" \"Yeah. For you too, I hope.\" \"I don't even want to think about what went on in that house.\" \"Well, you look great. Getting laid has done wonders for your complex\u00ad ion.\" \"Well, that and rehab.\" She winked at me and smiled. Her prayers had been answered. She was normal again. \"I'm going to get out of your hair and live at the Argyle hotel until I get Page 434 418 my daughter back, which should be very soon,\" she said. \"I came by to give you the money I borrowed from Mystery.\" She handed me a check and bounded back into the limo. As I watched her leave, she unrolled the window and yelled, \"And this one won't",
  "189": "bounce.\" I was really going to miss her. A few days later, Lisa and I went to the Scientology Celebrity Center. We hadn't become Scientologists; we liked our income too much. Tom Cruise had kept his word and sent me an invitation to their annual gala. It was one of the most star-filled events I'd been to in Los Angeles. After dinner, Cruise, clean-shaven in a perfectly pressed black tuxedo, walked toward the table. His approach was hypnotic: There was no doubt in his walk, no effort in his smile, no intricacy in his intentions. I stood to shake his hand, and he clapped my shoulder forcefully. I kept my balance. Barely. \"Is that your girlfriend?\" he asked, looking Lisa up and down in anon- lecherous way. I couldn't imagine him ever being lecherous. \"You didn't tell me how gorgeous she was.\" \"Thanks. I can't remember ever feeling this fulfilled by someone.\" \"So you got tired of picking up women?\" \"Yeah, after a while it started to feel like filling a bucket with a hole in it.\" \"Exactly,\" he exclaimed. \"Cameron Crowe and I, when we were doing Vanilla Sky, would talk about what a one-night stand is and what a fuck buddy is. And when you kind of get down to it, those things are a false inti\u00ad macy. And they're unsatisfying. In a real relationship, sex means more. You just want to keep going, and you want to hang out all the time and talk about life. It's very cool.\" \"Yes, but the problem is that I don't want this to be the end of my jour\u00ad ney in this subculture. It just reaffirms society's message of monogamy and true love conquers everything and all those Hollywood happy endings. It seems so cheesy.\" \"Who says it's cheesy?\" Cruise asked, his eyes narrowing and his hands reaching out to attack me with a friendly gesture. \"You know what? I got past that. Since when is it cheesy to be in love?\" He had AMOGed me again. Page 435 Ghosts. We were just phantoms, drifting invisibly through a putrefying house that hadn't seen a maid or repairman in months. Mystery wasn't talking to Herbal. Herbal wasn't talking to Mystery. Papa hardly spoke to anyone. And for some reason Sickboy, Playboy, Xa\u00ad neus, and all the other Real Social Dynamics worker bees had stopped in\u00ad teracting with Mystery and me. Even the junior PUAs who hung out in the house\u2014Dreamweaver, Maverick, and other former students\u2014didn't say hello when I passed by. If I tried to engage them in conversation, they were curt. They wouldn't even look me in the eye. The only person who spoke to everyone was Tyler Durden. But inter\u00ad acting with him was never a conversation; it was an interrogation, like someone might have with an actor who wanted to play him in a movie. \"I really want to ask you something,\" he said one afternoon as he emerged from the kitchen with Sickboy. I'd always liked Sickboy. Despite the name, he was a well-raised, mild-mannered New Yorker. \"What do you have that enables you to get Lisa?\" Tyler Durden asked. \"Because I go out every night and work so hard on myself, and I know that I couldn't get her as a girlfriend.\" What was amazing about Lisa was that despite her roughness, she was one of the most generous women I'd ever been with. She'd make my bed every morning; she'd cook meals and bring them up to my room when I was working; and she rarely came over without a small gift\u2014a tube of Origins face cleanser, a bottle of John Varvatos cologne, a copy of Henry IV} Part I I'd been looking for. Perhaps I had found my Caresse. \"I guess I have life experience,\" I told him. \"All you do is sarge every night. You're only working on one aspect of yourself. It's like going to the gym every day and just doing bicep curls.\" His brows knitted, and his mind began turning rapidly. For a moment, he appeared to take the advice to heart. Then he rejected it, and his eyes be\u00ad gan to blaze. If it wasn't hatred they contained, it was at least resentment. Page 436 420 He resented me because I still didn't see him as an equal, because he still wasn't cool in my eyes, because he couldn't",
  "190": "pick apart the idea of coolness to a subset of behaviors he could model. Lisa dated me because, to her, I was cool. Tyler Durden would never be cool. He chewed my ear off for ten minutes about how good he was in the field now, and how he didn't need routines anymore to get IOIs, and how celebrities always tried to get him to go to parties. Finally, he turned to walk up to Papa's room. Sickboy remained be\u00ad hind, standing next to me. \"Aren't you coming?\" Tyler asked Sickboy, nod\u00ad ding his head upstairs as if something important were occurring there. \"I just want to say good-bye to Style,\" Sickboy said. \"You're leaving?\" I asked. I was surprised Sickboy was even acknowl\u00ad edging my presence. The door to Papa's room slammed lightly overhead. Sickboy looked up nervously. \"I'm out of this whole thing,\" he said. \"What whole thing?\" \"This house is toxic.\" The words burst out of him, as if they'd been slowly forming inside like a blister. \" There are so many cool things to do in L.A., and all anyone wants to do is sarge. I haven't even seen the Pacific Ocean the whole time I've been here. These guys are losers. I wouldn't intro\u00ad duce any of them to any of my friends back in New York.\" \"I know what you mean. Lisa can't stand them.\" \"It's a joke,\" he continued. He sighed the tension out of his shoulders, as if relieved he'd found someone normal, someone who understood, some\u00ad one who wasn't entirely brainwashed. \"They bring girls back to the house all the time, but the girls get creeped out and leave. Tyler Durden can hardly get anyone to return his calls. I don't think he's been laid in two months. Papa's had sex with probably one girl in the last year. Mystery can't hold onto a girlfriend to save his life. And when Xaneus came here, he was a cool guy. But now he seems fake. All he talks about is sarging. You're the only guy I want to model. You have a great lifestyle, a good job, and a cool girlfriend.\" Flattery will get you everywhere. \"I'll tell you what. I'm going to give Lisa a surfing lesson tomorrow. Why don't you join us? It'll be good for you to get out of the house and see the ocean.\" Page 437 MSN GROUP: Mystery's Lounge SUBJECT: Field Report\u2014Life at Project Hollywood AUTHOR: Sickboy For those who don't know, I've been sleeping in Papa's closet at Project Holly\u00ad wood. Today was the best day I've ever had here, despite all the crazy drama that has been going on. I woke up earlier than usual and went surfing in Malibu with Style and his girlfriend, who is really an amazing person. Seeing how cool they get along is really inspiring. He's one of the few people I've met in the game who has something great to show for all the effort he's put into it. The surfing was amazing. I was so happy to go because I haven't gone yet this summer. I recommend taking up the sport to anyone who's never tried it. As soon as you hit the water, your mind clears and it's almost impossible to think of anything else. It's truly a relaxing experience. Afterward, we ate at a fish stand right at the edge of the Pacific Ocean and had a great conversation about music, friends, traveling, life, and careers. When I returned to the house, I did some work. Then I watched The Lost Dragon with Playboy, whom I've become good friends with. During the movie, Herbal and Mystery talked outside and settled their differences. Though Mys\u00ad tery's still upset at Katya, he said he wouldn't hold it against Herbal for falling in love with her. And Herbal said that if Mystery paid for the damages to his room, he'd forgive Mystery for his behavior. Thank God. It's good to see this thing ended in a sane way. Mystery will be moving out of the house tomorrow anyway, which I think is a shame. At about 2:00 A.M., Playboy, Mystery, and I sat in the main room smoking a hookah, listening to music, and talking about our goals in life. I didn't have a single conversation today about sarging, pickup, or the community. My day was filled with real conversations with real friends. I didn't",
  "191": "need to fuck some L.A. bimbo from the Saddle Ranch for validation. In fact, I didn't do a single set all day. Page 438 422 These are the days that make life worth living. These are also the days that will miss when I move out of Project Hollywood. -Sickboy Page 439 I sat uselessly in the living room and watched Mystery pack the last of his possessions: the platform boots, the ridiculous peacocking hats, the pin\u00ad striped suits he no longer wore, the lunch box with his picture emblazoned on the front, the hard drives filled with lesbian porn and episodes of That 70s Show. I couldn't help feeling that maybe we'd made the wrong decision. \"So where are you going?\" I asked. 'I'm moving to Las Vegas. I'm going to start Project Vegas. I've learned from my mistakes here, and Project Vegas will be bigger and better. There are hotter women in Vegas, and great opportunities for doing casino magic. I'm going to fly my brother-in-law to Vegas to record his songs, with me singing. Imagine\"\u2014he ran his hand along the air as if reading aline of type\u2014 \"the world's greatest pickup artist releases an album of love songs. Who wouldn't buy that?\" Mystery's manic sense of possibility was back. \"Ania will be living with me there. And, since you're my best friend, once I get it set up, I'd like you to join me. We'll build it right this time. We will be in charge, and we'll carefully screen everyone we move into the house.\" 'I'm sorry, man.\" I couldn't just follow him around every time he fucked things up for himself. \"It'll be Mystery and Style, just like the old days,\" he persisted. He opened the front door of the house and carried a suitcase onto the landing as he delivered one of the many great aphorisms that he used to turn defeat into triumph. \"Where there's a problem, there's an opportunity.\" \"I can't go through this again.\" The words, apologetic, came out accu\u00ad satory. \"I understand,\" he said. \"Sometimes events turn sour, and we follow bad threads in our lives. I want you to know that, even though we haven't seen eye to eye lately, I will always be your friend, for life and a day. You don't have to manage your relationship with me. Enjoy your girlfriend, and we will always have time to hang out together. You are the most important man in my life.\" Page 440 424 My face swelled and my eyes tingled with the first flush of tears. \"Try not to queer that up, okay?\" he smiled weakly, choking back emo\u00ad tion himself. A cab pulled into the driveway and honked, and Mystery slammed the door shut on Project Hollywood. The blank whiteness of the door wavered in the mist of my eyes. I felt like I was losing a piece of myself. For a mo\u00ad ment, I couldn't figure out which of us was the bigger fool. Within a week, Katya had moved into Herbal's room and Papa had moved two PUAs into Mystery's old room. One of them was Dreamweaver, a former student of mine; the other one I'd never met before. Papa planned to move a third PUA into Mystery's closet. With the influx of new, younger residents, Project Hollywood looked more like a frat house every day, though most frat houses were cleaner. Without Mystery sitting in the living room, ready and willing to share the details of his latest drama with whoever passed by, the lack of commu\u00ad nication in the house became even more uncomfortable. Whenever I walked through the living room, I'd find new roommates lying on their bel\u00ad lies on the carpet, playing video games. They never looked up or said a word, even when I greeted them. They weren't PUAs; they were vegetables. If someone had told me two years ago that this was the lifestyle I had to look forward to, I would never have joined the community. I would have realized that those who live by the joystick are doomed to die by the joystick. At Papa's twenty-fourth birthday party, not a single woman showed up\u2014let alone Paris Hilton, who, needless to say, had never come to party at Project Hollywood as Papa had hoped. His only friends were PUAs. And, for some reason, they all",
  "192": "ignored me. I couldn't understand it. In the week that followed, Tyler Durden, who'd never been directly hos\u00ad tile to me, started writing posts attacking me online. I decided it was time to have a talk with him about everyone's strange behavior in the house. I navigated through the overflowing trash bags in the kitchen; walked through the backyard, where just a small puddle of sludge lay at the bottom of the hot tub; and knocked on Papa's back door. I found Tyler Durden sitting at a computer, posting on the seduction boards. \"I want to talk to you about what's been going on lately,\" 1 said. \"Every\u00ad one in the house is acting weird\u2014even weirder than usual. And you seem to have a chip on your shoulder. Are people pissed because I've been hanging out with Lisa too much and not going out sarging?\" Page 441 425 \"That's part of it,\" he said. \"But a bigger part of it is that no one in this house likes you. Everybody thinks that you're a snob and that you're re\u00ad sponsible for a lot of trouble in this house, because you talk about people behind their backs.\" Though these were strong words coming from Tyler Durden, who had never said a cross word to my face before, his voice wasn't venomous. He spoke almost obsequiously, as if he were trying to give me constructive advice from one PUA to another. \"I'm just saying this because I'm your friend, and I don't want to see what happened to Mystery happen to you.\" I didn't know how to respond because I was so taken aback. I had no idea the other guys in the house felt that way. \"Yeah,\" he went on. \"Did you notice how Extramask used to be your friend, but then he started avoiding you? Well, that's because he didn't trust you. Dreamweaver told me he hates your guts. Maverick hates you too.\" I thought about what he was saying. Maybe he was right. The enthusi\u00ad asm I had brought to my first encounters with fellow sargers had dissipated as I saw routines sold instead of shared and perfectly normal men turn into creepy social parasites. So, though I was always friendly to everyone, maybe they were picking up on the fact that I was growing disillusioned with the community. On the other hand, as Juggler had always pointed out, people tended to feel comfortable around me. I'd always been friendly and easy to get along with, even before I'd joined the community. I had no enemies, or so I thought. When I left the room after another hour of talk, my head was spinning. I couldn't understand why these guys, who I'd spent the better part of two years getting to know, hated my guts. What had I done? The answer, I soon found out, was nothing. Page 442 When I saw Playboy in the living room packing his books into boxes, I asked the usual: \"What's going on?\" \"I'm moving out.\" First Extramask, then Mystery, then Sickboy, and now Playboy. I was on a sinking ship. \"Do you have a few minutes?\" he asked. \"I want to get something off my chest before I leave.\" Playboy brought me into his room and shut the door. \"They're trying to freeze you out,\" he said. \"Who's trying to freeze me out?\" \"Papa and Tyler Durden. They're using tactics on you.\" \"What are you talking about? What do you mean by tactics?\" \"Wow, you really have no idea what's been going on up in Papa's room. Tyler Durden is telling everyone to ignore you. He wants you to think that everyone hates you. He's trying to make you uncomfortable in the house.\" \"Why would he want to do that?\" \"He wants to take over. And he can't have you here because you threaten him.\" This explained the head games Tyler Durden was playing the other day, the reason he was trying to make me think everyone was against me. He was attempting to drive me out. He was running game on me. \"He sees you as a threat to his power because he can't suck you in. You're not weak like Xaneus,\" Playboy continued. \"He sees you as a threat to his finances because you want him to pay rent. And he sees you as a threat to his women because you made out with that girl he picked up in Vegas. He thinks that if",
  "193": "he lets his girls get near you, they're going to lose at\u00ad traction for him.\" \"He's still upset about that?\" \"Yeah. But I think the main problem is that Tyler and Papa associate you with Mystery, and he's their competition. They have a gang mentality. They think in terms of alliances. So they pushed Mystery out, and now Page 443 427 they're pushing you out. They want to make the whole house an office and dormitory for Real Social Dynamics.\" \"I don't understand. How could they have pushed Mystery out? He dug his own grave.\" \"But don't you see how they helped it along? How Papa invited Katya to sleep at the house and then brought her back after Mystery kicked her out? They were baiting him.\" Each sentence Playboy spoke was like a strip of gauze being removed from my eyes. \"Everything Papa said in his room during the house meeting, he was instructed to say by Tyler Durden. He's a follower. And I made a mistake by going along with it too. If I could do it all over again, I'd vote for Mystery to stay. This house was his project. Even if his behavior was out of line, he had a right not to want his ex-girlfriend here.\" I had played right into their hands. They were such masters of social manipulation that they had set up the meeting so I thought I was in charge. Papa even kept calling me the house leader. And thus, they'd man\u00ad aged to make it my decision to kick Mystery out. So much for the whole win-win idea. \"They played me like a puppet,\" I said, shaking my head in disbelief. \"They played me, too. That's a large part of the reason I'm leaving. Tyler Durden can get those guys to do whatever he wants. He's not moti\u00ad vated by girls. He's motivated by acquisition and power.\" How could I have been so blind? In Las Vegas, I had even told Tyler Durden point blank that he was the kind of person who liked to rise to the top of a situation by eliminating his competitors. And he had agreed. \"All they do up in Papa's room is hang out in the bathroom and plot,\" Playboy elaborated. \"Every word that comes out of Tyler Durden's mouth is calculated. Every post he writes is to serve an agenda. That guy's mind is all gears, turning and manipulating. He sees everything in life as a set. They even talk about 'guy sets' up in Papa's room now. They have routines worked out to make students give their workshops better reviews and rou\u00ad tines to control guys in the house. Every time someone new comes up to their room, they inoculate him against you.\" We had created a dangerous precedent by studying how to control social situations in clubs. It had led to a mindset that everything in life was a game that could be manipulated to a player's advantage with the right routines. But there was one thing I still didn't understand. \"If what you're saying Page 444 428 is true,\" I asked Playboy, \"why was Papa avoiding me and Mystery before there was even a plan to freeze us out of the house?\" \"That came from Tyler Durden too,\" Playboy said. \"He didn't want Papa representing Mystery's business as well as his, so he turned Papa against Mystery as soon as you guys moved in. Then, once Mystery and Papa started bickering, he told Papa to avoid you guys completely and use the back door to enter the house.\" So many connections were firing in my head as Playboy spoke. All the weirdness that had been taking place in the house since day one had been orchestrated by a little man in the closet, the wizard of Project Hollywood. I felt like such a chump. \"The biggest mistake you and Mystery made,\" Playboy concluded, \"was having Papa move into this house.\" There was a lesson here, perhaps the last one this community would teach me. And that was always to follow my instincts and first impressions. I hadn't trusted either Papa or Tyler Durden when I'd first met them. I found Papa spoiled and robotic, and Tyler Durden soulless and manipula\u00ad tive. And though they'd made great leaps forward when it came to fashion and game, Mystery was right: The scorpion can't deny its nature. Yet, at",
  "194": "the same time, Mystery and I weren't entirely blameless. We had used Papa as a patsy to sign the lease and pay for the most expensive room. We had never attempted to befriend him or treat him as an equal. When I was checking e-mail later on my computer in the office area of the house, I noticed a program called Family Key Logger. I would have ig\u00ad nored it if it weren't for the paranoia I'd developed as a result of my discus\u00ad sion with Playboy. So I Googled the name of the program. When 1 saw the results, anger swung through my body like a wrecking ball. Someone had installed software that was capturing every word typed on the keyboard and storing it in a text file. The computer was intended as a shared resource so that residents and guests could check the Internet. This meant that who\u00ad ever had installed the program now had everyone's passwords, credit card numbers, and private e-mails. Unbeknownst to me, there had been a war going on in the house from the moment we'd moved in. Afterward, I called Sickboy in New York. I wanted a second opinion. \"Does that match your experience?\" I asked after telling him every\u00ad thing Playboy had said. Page 445 429 \"Totally. When Mystery was there, they did what they're doing to you now. Tyler Durden and Papa would say, 'Don't talk to Mystery; freeze him out.' Everything they do is a routine. The house meeting about Mystery was thought out for days. They'd constantly talk about how to get Mystery to move out so they could take control of Project Hollywood. The house is part of their business plan. I had to leave. I can't be around that shit.\" In the days that followed, I talked to Maverick and Dreamweaver. They both told the same story: Mystery and I, supposedly the best players in the community, had been played. The worshippers were smashing their idols. Page 446 There was one pickup guru I still needed to meet. I didn't want advice from him on how to pick up girls; I wanted advice on how to stop. Everyone in the community had mentioned his name. He was a sort of spiritual presence that hung over the pickup world, a mythological figure like Odysseus or Captain Kirk or an HB11. He was Eric Weber, the first modern PUA, the writer of the 1970 book that started it all, How to Pick Up Girls, and the subject of the movie with the same name. I met him in a small post-production studio, where he was editing a film he had directed. He definitely wasn't peacocked; he looked like a middle-aged advertising executive, with gray hair, a starched shirt but\u00ad toned up too high, and featureless black pants. Only his eyes, which sparkled with energy, gave evidence that his youthful daring had not yet been extinguished. Are you aware of the seduction community? I am. But I look at it with the sense of being imitated. Part of what came along after my book was repellant to me. I don't believe in doing things that twist and turn a person. I was never interested in conquering women in a despotic way. I was interested in finding somebody to love. However, I didn't stay passionately interested in seduction. I felt like there were too many other things I wanted to do. What made you get over it? I lost interest after getting married, gaining more confidence in myself, and realizing that accumulating dozens of notches in my belt wouldn't cure my existential despair. What also helped was having two daughters who have occasionally accused me of being sexist, which I am mildly, I guess. What was your existential despair? I think the existential dilemma is: We're social animals, so we all wrestle with a sense of inadequacy. But when we realize that we're not as inade\u00ad quate as we thought we were, and when we realize that everybody else also Page 447 thinks they're inadequate, then that ache goes away and the idea that we're not a person of value disappears to some extent. And what about those people who don't get rid of their sense of inade\u00ad quacy? They become obsessed with sleeping with more and more women. And that's a",
  "195": "problem. Then there are the kinds of guys who need to be in therapy sessions. I can't tell you how many people I've seen in bad clothes say, in a nasal voice, \"Eric, I can't seem to pick up girls.\" I tell them, \"You need new clothes, bet\u00ad ter posture, and a speech therapist.\" All these things are evidence of deep in\u00ad ner psychological wounds. The phone rings. He answers it, speaks for a few minutes, then hangs up. That was a girl I picked up thirty-eight and a half years ago\u2014my wife. I was actually researching the book right around the time I met her and used a line on her. She walked past me in a bar and I said, \"You're much too pretty to let get away.\" I thought this tough New York chick would be mad. But she said, \"You think so.\" I couldn't get rid of her after that. So how did you actually conceive of the book? I had a friend who was a copy trainee with me at Benton and Bowles. One day we both looked through the window of the El Al office next door and noticed a girl working there. She was Mediterranean and gorgeous, like a Botticelli. The next day, he saw me and said that during his lunch break he'd followed her to a deli, where she got a sandwich, and then sat down in the park, talked with her, and made a date to have dinner that Friday. The next week, he came in and said that she was a virgin. He had to run out and find a tin of Vaseline because she was so tight. That's what gave me the idea of doing a book on picking up girls. I got interested in his brazen - ness and his ability to turn talking to strangers into a comfortable, everyday thing. I was very shy and unconfident growing up. I wrote about pickup be\u00ad cause I couldn't do it, and I really, really wanted to be good at it. Was there any precedent for it at the time? In the mid-sixties, life was changing radically in America. Women had just started taking the pill; the Stones and the Beatles had hit; Bob Dylan was Page 448 432 becoming popular. A whole counterculture was taking shape. Life was very suddenly wildly erotic. In the forties and fifties, if you grew up in your hometown, you met people at church socials or were introduced by an aunt. But in the sixties, all these people were moving out of their parents' homes into their own apart\u00ad ments in the city. They lived alone without the conventional means of meeting. So singles bars became popular. And people needed new tools to meet strangers. What do you think is the difference between naturals and guys like us who need to learn analytically? I think that naturals have the psychological power to do it. Toward the end of my singlehood, I found a boldness that was shocking. I developed the courage to tell a woman after a glass of wine, \"I'd like to fuck you.\" There are some women looking for you to be bold and a leader. It took me a long time to learn that. Something strange happened to Eric Weber when the conversation veered toward naturals and tales from the field. He came to life. The spark in his eyes brightened. For a half hour, we swapped stories and theories about the game. For all his talk of marriage and happily ever after, beneath the surface still seethed that awkward guy who was envious of his friends' success with women. After we talked, he showed me a scene from the movie he was editing. It was about a pale, bald, unemployed middle-aged man shopping a terrible screenplay and sponging off his ex-wife, who was now married to a hand\u00ad some, successful man. \"Is that screenwriter in the movie the way you really see yourself?\" I asked as we walked out of the building together. \"That's the inner me,\" he admitted. \"Inside I sometimes feel pathetic, awkward, and unloved.\" \"Even after all the confidence you acquired as a pickup artist, a hus\u00ad band, and a father?\" \"Well,\" he said, opening the door to his car, \"all you can do is put on an appearance of confidence sometimes. And after a while, others will start to believe it.\" He grabbed the door handle to pull it closed. \"And then you die.\" Slam. Page 449 At",
  "196": "2:00 AM, Lisa burst into the house, making her nightly drunken en\u00ad trance. She stomped up my stairs, shedding her purse and clothing on the way, and leaped onto my bed wearing nothing but a beer bottle. \"I'm attracted to you in every way,\" she blurted. \"Really?\" \"Do you know what all the ways are?\" \"Urn, maybe.\" \"Do you want me to name them?\" \"Sure.\" \"Emotionally, physically, and mentally.\" \"That's a lot of ways.\" \"I can elaborate.\" \"Okay. Let's start with the physical.\" That's probably the area where I still needed the most reassurance. \"I love your teeth, and your mouth especially.\" I listened for hesitation or doubt. There was none. \"I love how broad your shoulders are and how narrow your hips are. I love the hair placement on your body. I love the color of your eyes, because they're the same as mine. I love the shape of your nose. I love the indents on the side of your head.\" \"Oh my God.\" I flipped on top of her and grabbed her shoulders. \"No one has ever complimented me on my head indentations before. I love them too.\" I laughed, a little too loudly, at the ridiculousness of what I'd just said. And then I confessed everything to her. I told her about the last two years of meeting players and learning about the game. I told her about the AFCs and PUAs, the FBs and MLTRs, the IOIs and AMOGs. \"I would love to have you dress super-hot one day,\" I said, caught up in the excitement of the game I had helped invent, \" and then go to a bar. And I'll practice AMOGing all the guys who try to hit on you.\" She rolled me off her, so that we were facing each other on our sides, our faces an inch apart. \"You don't need to take their advice,\" she said, her Page 450 434 breath intoxicating and intoxicated. \"Everything I like about you, and everything that makes me think you're rad, is all the stuff you already had before you met those PUA guys. I don't want you wearing dumbass jewelry and Pee-wee Herman shoes. I would have liked you before all that self- improvement shit.\" From outside, we heard the sounds of men climbing the hill, flush with the excitement of another night out almost getting laid. \"All the things you learned from the PUAs almost made us not come together,\" Lisa continued. \"I want you to just be Neil: balding, nerdy, glasses, and all.\" Maybe she was right. Perhaps she would have liked the real me. But she never would have had the opportunity to meet him if I hadn't spent the last two years learning how to put my best foot forward. Without all that train\u00ad ing, I never would have had the confidence to talk to and handle a girl like Lisa, who was a constant challenge. I needed Mystery, Ross Jeffries, David DeAngelo, David X, Juggler, Steve P., Rasputin, and all those other pseudonyms. I needed them to discover what was me to begin with. And now that I had found that person, brought him out of his shell, and learned to accept him, perhaps I had outgrown them. Lisa sat up and took a sip from the bottle of beer she had brought up\u00ad stairs. \"Everyone was hitting on me tonight,\" she giggled. Modesty was never her strong suit. \"I hope you realize that you are dating the most fabu\u00ad lous girl in L.A.\" In response, I wordlessly pulled open my bottom dresser drawer, grabbed two large manila envelopes from inside, and brought them to the bed. I turned the first envelope upside down and dumped its contents onto the comforter. Hundreds of paper scraps, matchbooks, business cards, cocktail napkins, and torn receipts spilled out. Each one contained the handwriting of a different girl. Then I emptied the second envelope onto the bed\u2014full of more of the same\u2014until there was a small mountain of pa\u00ad per scraps. They were all phone numbers I'd collected since taking that first fateful workshop with Mystery. \"I know you are,\" I finally answered her. \"I've spent two years meeting every girl in L.A. And out of them all, I chose you.\" It was the most beautiful thing I'd said in a long time. And, after I spoke it, I realized it wasn't entirely",
  "197": "accurate. If there was anything I'd learned, it's that the man never chooses the woman. All he can do is give her an opportunity to choose him. Page 451 Herbal was the next to go. I saw him from my bedroom window, stuffing his robot vacuum cleaner into a U-Haul van. \"I'm going back to Austin,\" he said with a wan smile when I ran out to talk to him. He was the last person I expected to abandon the house. \"Why? After all you went through with Mystery, you're going to leave?\" \"I just feel like the house has been a failure,\" he said. \"No one hangs out anymore. The RSD guys stopped talking to me when I started working for Mystery, and Papa keeps moving in guys I don't really like.\" \"What's Katya doing?\" \"She's moving to Austin with me.\" I suppose if Katya were using him solely for revenge, she would have dumped him by now. \"Urn, by the way, what should I do when your wallaby arrives?\" \"I've already arranged to have it sent to Austin.\" Watching Herbal pack his possessions into the moving truck, I was struck by a much more profound sadness than when Mystery had left. With Mystery, I had lost a friend and former mentor. But I had thought that per\u00ad haps without the drama, the house could unite. However, between Tyler Durden's plotting and Herbal's imminent departure, Project Hollywood was truly dead. Outside of Papa and Tyler Durden, everyone seemed to be waking up from the spell the community had cast on them. Even Prizer\u2014the sarger who had lost his virginity in Juarez\u2014had stopped selling his pickup DVD course and become a born-again Christian. In his last post, he warned, \"Snap out of your trance and stop handing your salary over to a bunch of losers who are only able to seduce gullible guys. There's more to life than sarging.\" If the stupidest sarger of us all had outgrown the community, what was I still doing here? Behind Herbal and me, a beer bottle shattered on the street, scattering Page 452 436 fragments of green glass everywhere. I looked up and saw a teenager with a dyed-blond Eminem crewcut and a white tanktop sitting on our steps. \"Who's that?\" \"I don't know,\" Herbal said. \"He's been staying up in Papa's room.\" I was alone here now. It was just me in my bedroom against the borg in the rest of the house trying to force me out. I was tired of fighting. I was tired of being disappointed in people. I didn't need to be here anymore. Be\u00ad sides, I had a girlfriend. Still, I couldn't help thinking, \"If I was so smart, how did Papa end up with the house?\" Lisa answered that question as we lay in bed together that night. \"Because you didn't want the house,\" she said. \"It's not a life. It's a sub\u00ad culture you dipped into. How could something be good that's based on a false reality and a learned behavior? Walk away. These guys aren't helping you anymore. They're holding you back.\" Watching The Wizard of Oz as a child, I was always disappointed when Glinda the Good Witch told Dorothy that she'd possessed the power to re\u00ad turn home since the moment she had arrived in Oz. Now, twenty years later, I understood the message. I had possessed the power to leave the commu\u00ad nity all along, but I hadn't reached the end of the road until now. I still be\u00ad lieved that these guys had something I didn't. Yet the reason all the gurus latched on to me\u2014the reason Tyler Durden wanted to be me, even though he hated me\u2014was that they thought I had something they lacked. We were all searching outside ourselves for our missing pieces, and we were all looking in the wrong direction. Instead of finding ourselves, we'd lost our sense of self. Mystery didn't have the answers. A blonde 10 in a two- set at the Standard didn't have the answers. The answers were to be found within. To win the game was to leave it. Even Extramask had discovered that. After staying at a Vipassana med\u00ad itation center in Australia and an ashram in India, he was coming home to, as he put it in an e-mail to me, \"the way things were before.\" In the morning, I was awakened by noises",
  "198": "downstairs. Three new re\u00ad cruits for Real Social Dynamics\u2014replacements for Playboy, Sickboy, and Extramask\u2014were hauling boxes from Ikea into Herbal's room. Like those who came before them, they were former students turned interns and em\u00ad ployees, working for free in exchange for pickup lessons and a closet to Page 453 437 sleep in. They had quit their jobs; they had dropped out of school; they had left their hometowns for this. I sat in the living room in my boxer shorts and watched them as they worked. They were diligent. They were efficient. They were automatons. Wordlessly, they set up three bunk beds with matching sheets, blankets, and mattresses. Herbal's room was being converted into a barracks to house this growing army. The troops would be sent to the Sunset Strip nightly to do battle-armed with my clothes, my stories, my mannerisms-while the gen\u00ad erals in the bathroom plotted the last stages of their conquest of the com\u00ad munity. Even Mystery's Lounge would soon be theirs, with Mystery himself purged. There was nothing here for me now. I returned to my room, pulled several duffel bags off my closet shelf, and started packing. Hanging over me were rows of peacocking garments: a fuzzy purple vest, a pair of tight black vinyl pants, a pink cowboy hat. Stacked on the floor were dozens of books on flirting, NLP, Tantric mas\u00ad sage, female sexual fantasies, handwriting analysis, and how to be the jerk women love. I wouldn't need any of those where I was going. It was time to leave the house, and the community, behind. Real life beckoned.

HOW DO YOU CHOOSE EXERCISES? When you\u2019re training with weights at the gym, how can you know for sure that you\u2019re really stimulating your muscles to grow? Acutely, signs of a robust, muscle-growing stimulus usually include some perceived ten- sion in the target muscle. This experience might feel as though \u201csomething in there\u201d is either under great strain or potentially even ripping apart ever so slowly, especially when you train heavier for lower reps. A growth stimulus can also present itself as a burning sensation in the target muscle, especially if you\u2019re training for higher reps and going close to muscular failure. After each set and especially after a few sets, growth-stimulated muscles will often also feel super pumped and seemingly full of fluid as well as very fatigued and difficult to move in normal ways. In the hours and days after effective training, the target muscle might also feel tight and even a bit sore. In the longer term, muscle growth is best proxied by your repetition strength. So, if you can use the same weight for more and more reps over time or use an increasingly heavier weight for similar reps over time, this is a very good indication that you\u2019re probably gaining muscle. Now that you know which experiences correlate with probable muscle growth, you can choose the exercises you\u2019d like to use for any given target muscle you\u2019re interested in growing by looking for those very same signs of growth. The exercises that check the boxes of these growth correlates, or \u201cproxies\u201d as we might refer to them later, are probably your best bets for growth. Page 4 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 2 1. How do you choose exercises If growth is the goal, you should choose exercises that: 1. Cause tension and/or a burning sensation in the target muscles. 2. Give you the best pumps. 3. Zap energy from your target muscles the best. 4. Stress your joints the least. 5. Do all of the aforementioned things without needless exertion or systemic fatigue. That is, if you train the muscle hard, but you\u2019re not as all-around tired as you would be from other similar exercise choices, you\u2019re probably on the right track to choosing the best exercises possible for hypertrophy. Page 5 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 3 1. How do you choose exercises In essence, you\u2019re looking for the exercises that give you the most muscle-growth stimu- lus yet cost you and your body the least amount of fatigue possible. That is truly the ideal combination for hypertrophy as we consider exercise selection. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that zero fatigue at all is best, it just means that if you\u2019re going to choose a significantly fatiguing exercise, it had better be delivering a massive stimulus that makes the resulting fatigue worth it. Unfortunately, your body will be very good at adapting to exercises and rendering previ- ously very effective exercises a bit stale over time. Stale exercises will produce less stim- ulus, cause more fatigue, and will actually feel like they just aren\u2019t doing as much good as they were before. Page 6 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 4 1. How do you choose exercises While beginners can go months without experiencing any exercise staleness, eventually everyone will start experiencing the negative effects of having kept an exercise in the program just a bit too long. So, how do you know"

    "text": "if an exercise is stale enough to remove and replace with another one for that target muscle group? We\u2019ve got you covered. HOW TO KNOW WHEN TO KEEP AND REMOVE EXERCISES Keep doing an exercise that: 1. Gives you great tension, burn, pumps, and disruption (weird feelings, tightness, soreness in the target muscle). 2. Is easy on your joints and is worth the systemic fatigue. 3. Is steadily climbing in rep strength over the months. Replace an exercise that: 1. No longer gives you very good tension, burn, pumps, or disruption. 2. Is getting tough on your joints or zaps your strength for the rest of your program. 3. Has plateaued in rep strength over the last few weeks of training. Page 7 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 5 1. How do you choose exercises The fact that not all exercises will hit these conditions for change at the same time means you\u2019ll rotate some exercises once a month while keeping others in for years on end. Think of your training as a come-and-go social event where some of the more prominent figures may stay for most of the event while others enter the room and exit the room as they see fit across the evening. In a very similar way, your training program over months and years should mimic this natural flow based on the feedback your body gives you. Once you\u2019ve developed a fundamental understanding of which exercises you should be utilizing for hypertrophy, the question then becomes: How can you be sure that you\u2019re executing your chosen exercises properly? We\u2019ll answer that question in the next section. Page 8 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 6 2. WHAT IS PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE? In theory, proper lifting technique for optimal growth muscle has a few core features. The technique needs to stimulate muscle growth best and cause the least fatigue possi- ble, which we already discussed in the last section. In addition, the chosen exercise must be executed in such a way that keeps non-target muscles from being limiting factors. For example, if you\u2019re squatting to try to make your legs bigger but your lower back is taking most of the beating, you might have to alter your technique. Lastly, good technique needs to be replicable from rep to rep, set to set, and session to session so that you can track progress, plan weight/rep increases, be mindful of fatigue, and stay safe from injury. In order to check these boxes, most exercises you do will abide by a core group of about six technique fundamentals. In a sense, no matter which exercises you do, you should nearly always seek to: 1. Use a full and standardized range of motion (ROM). a. For example, going all the way down to your calves when you squat or bringing the bar all the way down to your chest when you bench press. 2. Use controlled eccentrics. b. Never let the weight simply fall down. You should seek to slow the descent of every rep by actively contracting the target muscles. Page 9 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 7 2. What is proper lifting technique 3. Avoid cheating. c. Any heaving or swinging to try to get more reps that uses muscles other than the target muscle to produce force is suboptimal for obtaining a muscle-growth stimulus. 4. Ensure that the limiting factor is the target muscle itself. d. When you\u2019re almost incapable of doing another rep in the lateral raise, it should be because your shoulders are giving out, not your grip, for example. 5. Take care of your joints. e. The best technique is when your joints should feel best given the four points above. For example, if two techniques let you hit the muscles equally hard, but one technique is easier on the joints involved, that choice is probably the better one. 6. Avoid going too light or too heavy. f. Sometimes your best technique plans break down if the weight is on the heavier end or on the lighter end, so avoid repetition ranges in any exercise in which the excessively low or high reps seem to cause technique breakdowns. And that\u2019s about as complicated as good technique has to be. At the end of the day, if you\u2019re getting a"

    "text": "great stimulus and very little fatigue, you\u2019re prob- ably in a good place in terms of mixing your exercise selection with proper technique. Now that you know how to choose exercises and how to perform them correctly, you\u2019re almost ready to lift hard and heavy. But first, in order to keep the injury risk as low as possible and perform as well as possi- ble, you\u2019ll have to warm up. Page 10 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 8 3. HOW SHOULD YOU WARM UP? First of all, why can\u2019t you just jump right into hard training? Why do you need to warm up at all? Warming up has a few very major benefits that make it near-mandatory for serious mus- cle-growth training. One of those benefits is that warming up makes the heavy lifting done after it less likely to cause injury. It makes your technique more efficient and targeted better to the muscle you want to grow. It also fires up your nervous system and allows you to push the target muscle to its limit, which usually occurs when the sets get very tough. So, how do you go about warming up properly? We have five simple steps to offer you. 5 STEPS FOR WARMING UP PROPERLY STEP 1: You can choose to do easy cardio for 5-10 minutes before warming up specifi- cally for your first weight training exercise, but this is optional. STEP 2: Begin with a 20RM+ weight for the first exercise of your session and do it for around 10 reps. Yes, you read that correctly! Choose a weight you can do easily for 20 reps or more, and just do 10 high-quality reps with great technique as you prepare for your working sets. Page 11 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 9 3. How should you warm up STEP 3: Do at least set with a weight halfway between your 20RM+ and your planned working weight for a set of about 4-8 reps. But, if the eventual weight you\u2019re going to lift for working sets is very heavy, you might have to do more warm up sets. For example, if your planned working weight is as follows, then you\u2019ll need to do the following number of intermediate sets (sets of 4-8 reps with a few minutes in between each): \u2022 0-50 pounds: 1 intermediate set \u2022 50-200 pounds: 2 intermediate sets \u2022 200-400 pounds : 3 intermediate sets \u2022 And you would continue this trend for even greater loads. STEP 4: Do your working weight (or 10% higher than your working weight) for 2-3 reps. This high-load warmup set is termed a \u201cpotentiation\u201d set, and it fires up your nervous system so that your body can really push itself hard on the first working set after. STEP 5: Once you\u2019re done with that potentiation set, get your working weight ready and do as many sets as you need to. When you switch to your next exercise that day, and for each new exercise after, just do the following: \u2022 5 reps with a weight halfway between your 20RM+ and the planned work- ing weight \u2022 The working weight itself for 2-3 reps At this point, you should be ready! If it\u2019s an exercise for a muscle group you haven\u2019t trained yet that day, going through the entire warmup up process for that exercise starting at step two is likely a good idea. Now, let\u2019s take a quick look at some warmup examples in which you\u2019ll rest for a minute or two between each warm up set: Page 12 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 10 3. How should you warm up Example 1: Upright Rows with a working weight of 65 pounds \u25cf Use the 30-pound straight, short bar for 10 reps. \u25cf Do 45 pounds for 5 reps. \u25cf Do 65 pounds for 3 reps. \u25cf Then, begin working sets at 65 pounds. Page 13 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 11 3. How should you warm up Example 2: Leg Presses with a working weight of 455 pounds \u25cf Put 1 45-pound plate on each side of the sled and do 10 reps. \u25cf Do 2 plates for 8 reps. \u25cf Do 3 plates for 6 reps. \u25cf Do 4 plates for 4 reps. \u25cf Do 5 plates (495 pounds) for 3 reps. \u25cf Then, begin working sets at 4 plates and a 25 per side (455 pounds). Hopefully, these examples provide you all of the insight you need to execute your warmup sets properly. After you\u2019re warmed up, the next logical training variable of consideration is how heavy you should be lifting for"

    "text": "your working sets. Remember, your working sets are the sets that provide most of the muscle-growth stim- ulus during your sessions, which means it\u2019s very important to make sure you\u2019ve chosen an appropriate load. How do you do that? We\u2019ll discuss that thoroughly in section four. Page 14 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 12 4. HOW HEAVY SHOULD YOU LIFT? It\u2019s mostly common knowledge that lifting heavy weights gets you bigger muscles. And, as it turns out that\u2019s true, but it begs the following question: \u201cHow heavy?\u201d Luckily, science has some very good answers! It turns out that, based on decades of scientific investigation, lifting a weight that\u2019s much less than about 30% of your 1RM is not going to reliably stimulate as much muscle growth as heavier weights would. You can still grow muscle lifting light like this, but you\u2019d have to do so many reps and so many sets to get even close to the most muscle growth you can stimulate with heavier weights that the sheer boredom, pain, and fatigue would limit you before you were able to grow as much as you could. At this point, you might be thinking, \u201cOkay, got it! Heavier is better. Let\u2019s just do one rep maxes to get huge!\u201d But that\u2019s not the case either. What\u2019s the problem with going that heavy? Much of the same scientific research has found that consistently lifting much over 85% of your 1RM range can grow plenty of muscle, but it comes with some limitations and side effects. Doing so few reps per set means you have to do more sets than you would have if you had simply gone a bit lighter. Going this heavy also causes a lot of wear and tear on your joints and connective tissues, which sums up a lot of fatigue and can stall progress just weeks into your plan. Page 15 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 13 4. How heavy should you lift Lastly, going this heavy needlessly elevates the risks of acute injury without actually growing any more muscle than lighter, safer training would. In summary, we can do better than lifting ultra heavy for maximum muscle growth. Knowing these facts, we can develop some general loading recommendations for muscle growth. 5 LOADING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MUSCLE GROWTH 1. Anything in the 30-85% range of your 1RM will cause great muscle gains. 2. This means most of your training should consist of hard sets of 5-30 reps within a few reps of failure. 3. Some exercises will be best suited toward lower rep ranges (5-15), such as antigravity compounds like rows, squats, deadlifts. This is because these exercises start to be limited in performance by your ability to remain stable, not because the target muscle itself is getting tired. 4. Some exercises will be best suited toward higher rep ranges (15-30), such as dumbbell, machine, and isolation movements because lighter loads in these movements can obviate stability problems, be safer, and be lifted for enough time per set to generate the highest stimuli of muscle growth. 5. Using a variety of ranges is probably best. A good start is to do about 50% of your working sets in the 10-20 rep range, with another 25% in the 5-10 rep range and the last 25% in the 20-30 rep range. Page 16 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 14 4. How heavy should you lift The big insight with loading is that, as long as your working sets fall generally between 5 and 30 reps each, the differences in growth from which end they are on and in what conditions is much smaller than if you fall outside of that range. In other words, if you are experiencing great tension and burn, great pumps, plenty of target muscle fatigue and soreness while your joints feel great and you don\u2019t feel crushed, whatever rep ranges you\u2019re using are probably pretty close to optimal. This ratio between stimulus proxies and fatigue proxies is called the stimulus to fatigue ratio (SFR), and you\u2019ll see it referenced in this guide several more times in various contexts.

    "text": "you can get in each set is hugely based on how long you rest between each set and the next one. So, is there a correct amount of time to rest in between sets? Yes! Here are our recommendations. After a given working set, you should rest long enough until you can at least check the following boxes for yourself: 1. Your target muscle can do at least 5 reps on the next set. 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. 3. Your nervous system/psychology will not limit you on the next set. 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. Page 18 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 16 5. How long should you rest between sets Here\u2019s an example with calf raises on a machine designed to illustrate how quickly the rest-time boxes can be checked in some scenarios: Example 1: Machine Calf Raise 1. Your target muscle can do at least 5 reps on the next set. \u2022 This requires 10 seconds of rest to accomplish. 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 Not applicable! Machine calf raises don\u2019t really tax your cardio- vascular system. Page 19 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 17 5. How long should you rest between sets 3. Your nervous system/psychology will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 This requires five seconds to accomplish because you\u2019re feeling strong and ready to go just shortly after the set is over. 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. \u2022 Not applicable! Since there really aren\u2019t any synergists in machine calf raises, it\u2019s all calves, and when they\u2019re rested for literally just 10 seconds, you can go again if you\u2019d like. Example 2: Barbell Squats with 500 pounds for sets of 10 reps: 1. Your target muscle can do at least 5 reps on the next set. \u2022 It might take 60 seconds until your quads are recovered enough for at least another five reps to be possible. 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 It might take three minutes until you\u2019re not gasping for air any- more, and, if you did another set right at the three-minute mark, your quads would limit more reps from being done, not your lungs. 3. Your nervous system/psychology will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 It might take four minutes until your feelings of depletion and defeat are replaced with feelings of strength and a desire for another challenge. 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. \u2022 This could take five minutes because that\u2019s how long it will take your lower back to stop hurting from all of the metabolic byproducts of your last squat set. Thus, because this is the limiting factor, you\u2019ll have to rest at least five minutes after your set of squats for the next set to be maximally productive. Page 20 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 18 5. How long should you rest between sets Does this mean you must go as soon as you\u2019ve checked all four boxes? No, absolutely not. But it means you can go again if you\u2019d like. If, however, you\u2019d like to rest a bit more, that\u2019s fine too! The big downside here comes from not resting enough rather than from resting a bit too much. That being said, if you don\u2019t want to spend too much extra time in the gym so that you can spend more time enjoying hobbies, work, or rest and recovery outside of the gym, it\u2019s probably wise not to stray too far away from the smallest tenable rest times. Page 21 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 19 6. HOW MANY SETS SHOULD YOU DO? The general answer to this question is \u201cenough sets to trigger robust muscle growth,\u201d but since that\u2019s much more of a tautology than a good answer, we\u2019ve got a few sci- ence-backed recommendations as well. Enough stimulus to ensure you\u2019re likely growing the most muscle tends to occur when the sets you did for a specific muscle give it a good or even great pump, tire it out plenty, and lead to a day or two of post-workout tightness, weakness, and maybe even slightly painful soreness to the touch. The number of sets it usually takes to accomplish this task is as follows: \u25cf Beginner: Can often be 1-5 sets per session (people training from 0 to 3 years) \u25cf Intermediate: Can often be 2-10 sets per"

How many sets should you do Those are big ranges, so if you\u2019re getting good pumps and other good proxies for stimu- lus, you can just stay with the number of sets you\u2019re currently doing. If you\u2019re not getting much of a stimulus, inch up the number of sets week by week (by only one set per muscle group per session at a time) until you\u2019re getting great stimuli. If you inch up too much, you might experience the downsides of doing too many sets, which present themselves as-follows: \u25cf When you cannot recover strength to at least baseline for your next session \u2022 If you did 100 pounds in an exercise for sets of 10 last week, but this week you\u2019re so tired from all the sets that you can only do sets of eight with that weight, you\u2019re probably doing too many sets and need to reduce them ASAP. \u25cf When you have overlapping soreness into your next session \u2022 If you trained quads on Monday and they are still sore to the touch on Thursday when it\u2019s time to train them again, it\u2019s probably wise to reduce next Monday\u2019s number of quad sets so that next Thursday you can be fresh for the workout. One of the best and simplest approaches to doing the proper number of sets per muscle per session looks something like this: First, start at the lowest number of sets per session that gets you a decent pump and muscle disruption. This might leave you saying something like, \u201cOkay, I feel that!\u201d Second, add one set per week if and as you get used to the work. For example, your pumps and disruption don\u2019t improve or decline a bit and your rep strength is still above baseline. Third, if you get to doing \u201ctoo much,\u201d it\u2019s time to give the body a break and do fewer sets for a while. Now you\u2019re all squared away for determining how many sets to do per muscle group, but how many sets should you be doing in total for all muscle groups trained in a given session at the gym? Page 23 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 21 6. How many sets should you do A couple of hints at what\u2019s too many sets come to mind. If you accumulate enough systemic fatigue during the workout, which means being tired in the core of your being versus being tired in a specific muscle, you won\u2019t be able to muster the effort to push your target muscle close to failure. This means doing any more sets would simply be too many sets for that workout. In other words, if you\u2019re stopping a set because you\u2019re \u201cjust tired\u201d versus your target muscle being close to its local failure point, doing more sets is probably a bad idea. The point at which most people reach this systemic fatigue speedbump lies somewhere between 15 and 30 working sets for the session/workout without counting warm up sets. If you\u2019re very strong and training huge swaths of muscle like legs and back, 15 total work- ing sets might be around the point when trying to do any more sets is a poor strategy. If you\u2019re smaller and, specifically, if you\u2019re training mostly smaller muscles in that work- out, such as biceps, side delts, calves, and/or forearms, you might be able to crank up to 30 sets per session and still be doing productive work in the latter sets. It\u2019s definitely possible to still be getting good benefits from more than 30 sets per session, but it\u2019s not likely. If you have to do that many or more sets per session regularly, the best approach is probably to increase the number of weekly workout sessions you\u2019re planning so that you can do fewer sets in each and make sure all the sets are of a high quality. Speaking of quality, one of the big determining factors of set quality is whether or not the muscle itself came fairly close to failure before you stopped the set. But how close is close enough? And, is it possible to have too much of a good thing when it comes to muscular failure? Let\u2019s find out next. Page 24 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 22 7. SHOULD YOU TRAIN TO FAILURE? Research on"

    "text": "training to failure has found that sets whose tail-end reps get close to failure grow more muscle than sets whose reps didn\u2019t get very close to failure. But that same research holds many other sometimes surprising insights as well. Let\u2019s dig into them. After numerous studies, it seems pretty clear that on average over the course of a 2-3 month training program, taking every programmed working set to failure shows no clear benefit over having all of the working sets stop at about three reps in reserve from failure, or basically when the bar/dumbbell/cable/machine begins to really slow down with each successive rep in most cases. In addition, it has been found that training all the way to failure, while causing no clear growth upside, likely causes a vastly disproportionate amount of fatigue. This high level of fatigue accumulates over weeks of training and can prevent the trainee from stringing together as many productive workout sessions as possible. On the other hand, training with a relative effort of much more than three reps in reserve seems to challenge the muscles so little as to cause notably less growth than training a bit closer to failure. Note too that our language of more than three reps in reserve refers to getting further and further away from failure. For example, this might mean bench pressing six reps at 225 pounds when doing 10 reps would have landed you at technical failure, which would represent having trained to four reps in reserve. What we\u2019re saying is that the sweet spot in this case would be bench pressing 225 pounds for seven, eight, or even nine reps. Page 25 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 23 7. Should you train to failure Taking all of this information into account, a very viable approach to relative effort over the mesocycle of training starts to look something like this: Start at your best guess of 3 RIR, and then write down your weight and reps for that workout. Add weight and/or reps each week and try to match weight and/or reps from last week in every working set even though these additions may make each work set a bit harder each successive week. For example, doing 100 pounds for 10 reps in week 1, then doing 105 pounds for 10 reps in week 2. Or, similarly, you could do 100 pounds for 10 reps in week 1, and then do 100 pounds for 11 reps in week 2. Sooner or later, you\u2019ll hit failure on most of your sets and fail to match or beat your prior week\u2019s performance. And this is very normal! This will occur because you can\u2019t just keep getting linearly stronger forever. But it will also occur much faster than strength itself peaks because fatigue accumulates over the weeks and eventually adds to the difficulty of continued progression. When this point of plateau and regression occurs, in most cases, the best practice will be to take some sort of break from hard training so that fatigue can dissipate. After that break, you can then begin the process of accumulation once again. Page 26 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 24 7. Should you train to failure Page 27 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 25 7. Should you train to failure This is the general process, but we can give some slightly more specific advice to you based on your current level of physique training advancement: Beginner \u25cf Starting at 4-5 reps in reserve (RIR) and ending at 2 RIR is great for technique establishment. \u25cf More isn\u2019t needed for the best results! \u25cf Grinding to failure often can teach and reinforce bad technique. Intermediate \u25cf Starting at 3 RIR and ending at 0-1 RIR is best. \u25cf Embrace 0 RIR for exercises that won\u2019t fall on you if you fail, but limit yourself to 1 RIR for those that will! \u25cf Intermediates will experience the challenge of pushing as hard as possible while demonstrating excellent technique. Advanced \u25cf Starting at 2 RIR and ending beyond failure for one week might be an effective idea. \u2022 2 RIR in week 1 \u2022 1 RIR in week 2 \u2022 0-1 RIR in week 3 \u2022 Assisted forced reps or drop sets in week 4 \u2022 This is done to get as much short-term stimulus as"

Okay, we\u2019re really getting somewhere now! You know how to choose exercises, how to execute them with good technique, how hard and heavy the working sets should be, and how many sets to do per muscle group and per session. Now the question becomes: \u201cHow many times per week should we train for best muscle growth results?\u201d The simple answer is that it depends on if you\u2019re recovered enough to train again. Page 29 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 27 8. How often should you train The core idea here is that the best training occurs when you\u2019re very recovered, and that the body has multiple mechanisms that make creating new growth stimuli much more difficult when you\u2019re not properly recovered as opposed to when you are. Essentially, you should train a given muscle again when the muscle has recovered enough to no longer feel sore and to perform at its normal strength levels or beyond. Muscles that are still sore or still too fatigued to perform at their usual abilities probably need more rest than they need more training. That being said, probably one of the biggest factors in determining how long it takes a given muscle to recover is the number of hard sets it performed during the session prior. For example, if you train your biceps with four working sets in a session, you might be able to recover every day or every other day depending on a few other factors like exercise selection, and you thus might be able to train the biceps four days per week or so. On the other hand, if you decided to have each biceps workout contain eight working sets per session, then you may only be recovered enough to perform two such sessions a week. Page 30 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 28 8. How often should you train That\u2019s the general idea, but there are both top-end and bottom-end limits on session volume and effective training frequency. It\u2019s usually not maximally productive or time-ef- ficient to train a given muscle with less than two working sets per session, and it\u2019s potentially too damaging and excessive to train most muscles with much more than 12 working sets per session. The result is that you might be able to train a muscle as often as six times per week (if you do very little volume per session) or as infrequently as two times per week (if you train the muscle with more sets per session). Training all seven days of the week or just once per week are suboptimal in most cases. Page 31 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 29 8. How often should you train Lastly, higher frequencies can actually support higher total weekly volumes per muscle and thus more growth, but they are so taxing to all fatigue axes (including joint and connective tissue wear and tear) that, in most cases, very high-frequency programs can only be most effectively performed for a few months before a much lower-frequency \u201ccooling off\u201d period is required. So yes, your friend might have grown her legs visibly from that crazy five times per week leg training program she did, but that\u2019s no way to train for the long-term. However, every now and again it can be a good idea when legs are the short-term priority. Now that training frequency per muscle group is sorted, how many total sessions per week should you be doing? The most important deciding factor for how many days to choose to go to the gym per week is adherence. If you give anyone a program which asks them to commit to more gym time than they can adhere to, it\u2019s just not worth it. In these cases, they may fail to the point that nothing productive will happen because their chronic inability to make all the sessions happen may discourage them from training at all. So, if someone could ideally benefit from six sessions per week but their schedule makes four sessions a strain, giving them a program that features three sessions per week and seeing how they handle it is almost"

For folks of different training levels, there is a bit more nuance: Beginner: 2-4 sessions per week \u25cf You don\u2019t want to burn them out \u25cf You want to ignite their desire for more training by having them do a bit less, not create a desire for less training by having them do too much. \u25cf They make great gains at low frequencies anyway because they are beginners and very sensitive to muscle growth stimuli. \u25cf Most programs will be all muscles in every session, as there aren\u2019t enough sessions to focus on any muscle group in particular. Page 32 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 30 8. How often should you train Intermediate: 3-6 sessions per week \u25cf They won\u2019t burn out because they love training, so up to six times per week is fine for those who really want it and have already proven to be successful at a frequency of five times per week. \u25cf They need more sessions to do each muscle justice as the volumes they need to do per muscle are climbing from their beginner days. \u25cf Split programs become common (push/pull, upper/lower, etc.). Advanced: 5-12 sessions per week \u25cf For advanced lifters, each muscle needs to be first in its session at least once a week so that it can get the best, freshest, training stimulus. \u25cf Training only two or three muscles per session is very common because advanced lifters get so fatigued just by training two or three muscles in a row that they can\u2019t do much more in a session without it being considered \u201cjunk volume.\u201d \u25cf If they train only five or six sessions per week, they likely need to emphasize some of their muscles for a few months and emphasize others for a few months by putting emphasized muscles first in each session and by putting de-emphasized muscles last and capping them at just enough volume to maintain their size (MV), which is only about a third of the volume they will typically need to grow the most from. This concept is known as their maximum adaptive volume (MAV). \u25e6 If they tried to train all of their muscles at around MAV, they would be running into junk volume problems daily at the end of each session. \u25cf Twice-daily sessions can take you to eight, 10, or even 12 sessions total if desired as an advanced lifter. Thus you can focus on all muscles again, but your recovery and lifestyle need to be calculated very strategically to survive this much weekly hard training. Page 33 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 31 9. HOW SHOULD YOU PROGRESS? Once you understand training frequency, it\u2019s important to figure out how to progress from week to week to produce consistent muscle gains. On the one hand, a progression that is too aggressive will lead to fatigue over-accumu- lation, performance loss, and the need to back off and let that fatigue dissipate. On the other hand, a progression that is too meek will result in lots of time wasted on sessions that are too easy to cause the best long-term growth outcomes. In order to avoid both downsides, here\u2019s a progression formula you can try with your own training: Choose: 1. A weight in the 5-30 rep range for any given exercise. 2. Enough sets to get you pumped and notably disrupted, which is usually somewhere between 3-5 sets in the first session of the mesocycle. Then: 1. Do that weight at 3 RIR. 2. Do enough sets to get you pumped and notably disrupted, but stop when you do. 3. Write down your weight and reps for each set. Page 34 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 32 9. How should you progress For next week\u2019s session of that same weekday: 1. Add enough reps, weight, or both to keep your RIR the same or lower it by one. For example: \u25cf 100 pounds for 10 reps at 3 RIR in week 1 \u25cf ??? pounds for 10 reps at 2-3 RIR in week 2 (answer can be 110 pounds) \u25cf 100 pounds for ??? reps at 2-3 RIR in week 2 (answer can be 12 reps) \u25cf ??? pounds for ??? reps at 2-3 RIR in week 2 (answer can be 105 pounds and 11 reps) However, there is one hard rule for progression. Your next week must beat your performance from last week. This can be done just by a tiny bit at the same RIR or by"

Just seeking to add either 5-10 pounds to the load or one rep to the reps each time can do wonders for simplifying all of the above. 2. Add sets from last week: \u2022 Add one set per session if you got little pump or disruption last time. \u2022 Don\u2019t add sets if you got a good pump and disruption last time. \u2022 Consider subtracting a set if you didn\u2019t remotely heal from soreness on time for the same muscle later in week. Page 35 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 33 10. WHEN AND HOW SHOULD YOU DELOAD? If you decide to follow our recommendations on load, rep, and set progressions across the mesocycle, you\u2019re going to be adding some combination of weight and reps each week. And in some weeks, you\u2019ll even be adding full sets to your workouts. At some point, you\u2019ll be performing way above your previous abilities, and the increased levels of accumulating fatigue will start to prevent you from improving (or even matching) your performances from weeks past. Page 36 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 34 10. When and how should you deload As obvious as this may sound, training while getting weaker and weaker is the opposite of progress. And, it turns out that high levels of fatigue can actually reduce or even prevent muscle growth at the biochemical level. Because of this, it\u2019s incredibly important to bring fatigue back down to baseline before beginning another accumulation phase once your fatigue has gotten high enough to consistently prevent you from getting stronger for reps week after week. If just one or a few of your muscle groups have maxed out their current performance but the rest of your muscle groups and system feel good, a recovery session is in order. Here\u2019s how to execute a recovery session: 1. Since we all experience underperformance from time to time, don\u2019t do a recovery session unless you\u2019ve had two sessions in a row for that same muscle that result in underperformance. On your second session of underperformance, finish that session as strong as you can. 2. During the next session for that muscle, do half the planned sets for half the planned reps and with half of the planned weight. If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWow, that sounds like it would be really easy,\u201d you are correct! But this is the point. Recovery sessions are designed to reduce fatigue, something only easy training can do. 3. Resume the sessions the week after at two thirds of the planned sets, but keep going up as you were in weight and/or reps. 4. Add weight, reps, and sets from there as you normally would. Using such recovery sessions can renew fatigued muscle groups for another week of hard training if needed, and using a few recovery sessions stacked together for half of a week can renew your progress for another few weeks if needed. However, after about 4-8 weeks of consistent, hard training, multiple muscle groups will have likely demanded recovery sessions by that point. Your entire body and even your Page 37 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 35 10. When and how should you deload mind will feel exhausted, overused, weak, and unresponsive, even down to diminishing the quality of your pumps. Additionally, your per-session working set volumes may start to get incredibly high as you chase ever-diminishing returns, and almost every set will be taken to failure (or very close), which will inevitably increase the fatigue you\u2019re experiencing by an exponential factor. This high local and systemic fatigue will cause you to underperform in pretty much all of your muscle groups and exercises in the same week. At this point, you\u2019re carrying so much fatigue that a simple series of recovery days won\u2019t cut it anymore. When this happens, you\u2019ll need to deload, which is essentially an entire week of recovery instead of just a few days. Its execution can look something like this: 1. First half of the week at half the planned sets for half the planned reps at 80-100% of"

Last half of the week at half the planned sets for half the planned reps and half of the planned weight! This should be ultra easy, and you can even combine a few days in that latter half of the week into one workout since doing the workouts individually might have you driving 30 minutes to and from the gym to do 10 minutes of exercise each time. If you can condense your sessions, feel free to do so. After such a deload week, you should be so recovered that you can productively train for another mesocycle before needing a break again. Now that you\u2019re planning and organizing your training on months-long periods, let\u2019s take a look at some of the higher-level forms of training organization that can help you plan and experience progress for months and years on end in a very effective and scientifically- congruent way. Page 38 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 36 11. HOW SHOULD YOU PLAN TRAINING PHASES? Each training week with an organized purpose is termed a microcycle in modern sport science. An accumulation phase of 4-8 increasingly harder microcycles with a one-week deload at the end with the purpose of clearing fatigue is in total termed a mesocycle. And, about three mesocycles all sequenced in a row in pursuit of the same general goal is known as a block of training. Page 39 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 37 11. How should you plan training phases In the beginning of each block of training for muscle growth, your volume sensitivity is very high and your joint and connective tissue fatigue is very low because you\u2019re very fresh. Thus, you can both handle heavy loads and don\u2019t need a lot of sets of them to grow the most muscle. In addition, each workout highly disrupts your sensitive muscles, and it can take your muscles quite a while to heal from any single workout for that very reason. Because of these aligning factors, it may be wise to consider programming a few more of your working sets than usual in the 5-10 rep range and fewer in the 10-20 and 20-30 ranges. Lastly, your per-muscle group frequency of training can be on the lower end or around two or three times per week for nearly all trained muscles. As the block progresses into the second and third mesocycles, you can consider adding a session to some of the muscle groups that seem to be healing quite fast such as the calves, biceps, and side delts for many people. Instead of training them two or three times per week, you can, over the next two mesocycles, increase them to three or four times per week on average. This session addition is totally optional, but doing so might eek out a bit more growth than sticking with the same session numbers the entire time. Once you\u2019ve added sessions, our recommendation is to add most or all of the new sets in the 10-20 or 20-30 rep ranges since these rep ranges don\u2019t cause as much joint and connective tissue fatigue as heavier sets. When you add the extra days of training, you\u2019ll of course also be adding exercises. We recommend adding exercises that comport well with the higher rep ranges you\u2019re using them in and ones that are easier than average on the joints. For example, while barbell squats might be best in the 5-10 range and hack squats might beat up your knees a bit too much to add later in a block, you could add sets of 20-30 reps in the leg press while going easy on the load and joint stress but crazy hard on the high-rep burning effort! That being said, remember that you don\u2019t have to make any of these changes. But, if you\u2019re looking for ways to modify your successive mesocycles in a block, going lighter and higher frequency is probably a better move than the alternatives. If you\u2019re really looking to consider advanced progression factors, you might decide to choose exercises with a lower SFR that stress the stretch and eccentric of the movement less than others in the first mesocycle of a block. Conversely, consider choosing"

    "text": "exercises that are the highest possible SFR and stress the eccentric and stretch of the movement intensely later on when your physiology is more resistant to growth and needs to be exposed to as much stimulus as possible to grow further. Page 40 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 38 11. How should you plan training phases After an entire block of increasing loads, volumes, and training frequencies, it\u2019s very likely that you are going to be physically and mentally exhausted. Research is very clear that when you\u2019re very fatigued, you cannot make your best gains in training. And, in some cases, you may not even be able to make any gains at all, which obviously presents an enormous problem when becoming as muscular as possible is the name of the game. When you reach this point, it\u2019s time to bring fatigue down so much that you have enough margin to train for another block or two after with only deloads to bring it down. To bring this much fatigue down, you can choose one of two plans of action. LOW-VOLUME MAINTENANCE PHASES The first option is a low-volume maintenance phase of training. These phases typically last for 3-4 weeks, and feature maintenance volumes (or about a third of the number of sets typically featured in your normal block training) that remain stagnant through the entire mesocycle. In terms of set and rep recommendations, it\u2019s probably best to perform most of your sets in the 5-10 rep range to allow volume sensitivity to climb back up as high as it can. Regarding frequency, training each muscle once or twice per week should allow fatigue to decline greatly while muscle mass is just barely preserved. After deloading at the end of this very unchallenging mesocycle, you\u2019ll be ultra low on fatigue and incredibly sensitive to volume, upon which you\u2019d begin the first low-volume mesocycle of your next three-mesocycle training block. ACTIVE REST PHASES An alternative to the maintenance phase is the active rest phase. This is a phase of just 2-3 weeks in which limited or no lifting at all occurs. Simply put, the goal is to have fun, sleep a lot, eat well, and enjoy your life. This is also the perfect time to go on vacation, take a trip, or do something else you find physically and psychologically rejuvenating. Page 41 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 39 11. How should you plan training phases If you do go into the gym, try to keep it to no more than two total sessions per week. And just to be clear, we\u2019re talking about two total sessions across all muscle groups. Within these two total weekly sessions, use less than 50% of your normal weights for half the per-session sets and reps you would usually perform. These ultra-easy weeks can reduce fatigue to almost zero, which can prime you for another productive block or two of training ahead. How do you choose between these strategies? If you need a diet break at maintenance along with a training break and you want that diet break to be a bit longer than 2-3 weeks, a maintenance phase (or even several in a row) is your best bet. If your diet dynamics don\u2019t require a maintenance phase and you want to get back to growth training as soon as possible, definitely give the active rest phase some thought. Page 42 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 40 12. BEGINNER VS. INTERMEDIATE VS. ADVANCED TRAINING Different training foci can change based on your level of advancement in lifting, so it\u2019s important to understand where you fall on the spectrum. To simplify things, we\u2019ve outlined the following parameters to help you identify yourself into one of the three training age categories: Beginner \u25cf You \u201cjust lift\u201d and you keep getting bigger and stronger automatically without much complexity. \u25cf You get stronger even when losing weight. \u25cf You\u2019re most likely to have lifted for 0-3 years, although this time frame could be longer in some cases. Intermediate \u25cf You\u2019ve hit your first plateau and had to figure your way around it. You find that you need to nail the basics consistently to keep progressing. \u25cf You get a little stronger"

Page 43 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 41 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training Advanced \u25cf If your sleep, recovery, nutrition, and training isn\u2019t meticulous and well-planned, you simply don\u2019t make gains. \u25cf Best case scenario, you maintain rep strength during weight loss phases, but often you lose a bit of rep strength. \u25cf You\u2019re most likely to have lifted for more than seven years, although this time frame could be less or more. If you\u2019re not sure which one you are, choose the less experienced of your two best choices and go from there. So if you think you might be an intermediate but you also might still be a beginner, do yourself the favor of assuming you\u2019re a beginner and func- tionally operate out of that assumption. Once you\u2019ve made your choice, or if you train other individuals who are of a certain advancement in their training age, you can incorporate some of the following training recommendations for each level. Beginners should: 1. Do mostly sets of 5-10 reps for getting stronger while improving technique. 2. Focus mostly on the compound basics as those will target the most muscle and build the most strength and movement compe- tency for later. 3. Focus tons on improving and solidifying their technique because proper technique will pay increased growth and decreased injury risk dividends for the rest of their training career. 4. Avoid 1 RIR or harder training as that\u2019s when fatigue tends to negatively impact the technique of beginner trainees. 5. Avoid near-MRV volumes to the point of performance declines for the same reason as mentioned in point four. Page 44 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 42 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training 6. Train each muscle in each of their 2-4 total weekly sessions because most beginners will neither need any more than that for best gains nor psychologically be able to handle much higher frequencies. Intermediates should: 1. Do mostly sets of 5-10 and 10-20 reps as they can now do higher reps without technique breakdown. At this point, they will also likely need the variation of extra rep ranges to keep their gains coming along at the best pace possible. 2. Focus mostly on the free weight compound basics and some isolations. This is primarily to get great results while still building a strong core, which will support more muscle building later. At the same time, intermediates should start to use some different machines and exercises to see which exercises have better SFRs for their unique anatomy. 3. Focus on altering their basic technique to fit their personal SFRs. They should now be much more skilled in detecting tension in their muscles as well as positions that cause the most and least joint stress. Utilizing this knowledge should make their technique better in most exercises. 4. Push from 3 RIR to 1 or even 0 RIR for most mesocycles while focusing on breaking barriers toward the end of each mesocycle. The intermediate stage is when most people learn what \u201chard\u201d training really means. 5. Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles as this will now be the best way to ensure maximum gains. 6. Train each muscle 2-4 times per week across 3-6 total sessions because they both need the extra sessions to make the best gains and can psychologically handle the extra work. Page 45 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 43 12. Beginner vs. intermediate vs. advanced training Advanced lifters should: 1. Do mostly sets of 10-20 reps, with some in the 5-10 rep range and some in the 20-30 rep range. In most cases, advanced lifters will be a bit too strong relative to their joint and connective tissue abilities to be able to survive intact with too much training coming from the heavy 5-10 rep range. 2. Focus mostly on the best SFR exercises for them instead of exploring the gym for new exercises to try out. Advanced lifters should still explore to some"

Explore techniques that maximize the SFR especially by techni- cally altering commonly performed lifts. For example, advanced lifters might put their feet closer together during squats and use a squat wedge in addition to wedged weightlifting shoes so that they can even better target their quads. 4. Push from 2 RIR to failure or even beyond while preserving their mind-muscle connection. This implies ultra-hard training that still targets the right muscles at high SFRs. 5. Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles. However, advanced lifters might have such high MEVs and low MRVs that this may not be a very big window for them anymore. In some cases, this could require a modest addition of 1-2 sets per session per muscle over the entire mesocycle. 6. Train each muscle 2-6 times per week across 5-12 sessions with two-a-days used in a phasic manner over the block if they are interested in competition or the highest levels of personal phy- sique transformation.

When people say that they\u2019re \u201cprioritizing\u201d a muscle, what does that even mean? In very basic terms, it means they really care about that specific muscle group growing as much as possible to the extent that they\u2019re willing to arrange their training in a special way to ensure growth. Page 48 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 46 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups 4 MOTIVATIONS FOR PRIORITIZING MUSCLE GROUPS More specifically, you can have some combination of the following motivations for prioritizing a muscle over others: Page 49 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 47 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups 1. One side or muscle is bigger than the other. \u2022 Maybe one bicep is bigger than the other. \u2022 Maybe your legs are disproportionately bigger than your upper body. \u2022 Maybe your chest is much bigger than your back. \u2022 Maybe your back is impressively thick but not very wide. 2. Limited resources require prioritization. \u2022 Going hard on all muscle groups leaves very little room to push any one of them much harder than you\u2019re already pushing it. \u2022 For example, if you wanted to prioritize your legs but you\u2019re still training your upper body as hard as possible, you might only have the energy to do a little bit more leg training than usual, which may not be enough to ignite any meaningful change. \u2022 But, if you reduce the amount of work you\u2019re doing on your upper body, that frees up time, energy, and recovery resources to let your legs grow bigger if you want to prioritize them. 3. Y ou just plain old want something to stand out. \u2022 Having big arms is never wrong, and if you want bigger arms, you can prior- itize them so they get bigger than everything else at a faster rate. 4. Time constraints \u2022 If you can only train three times per week, for example, but you\u2019re an inter- mediate and want to grow your whole body, training all of the muscles as much as they need might lead to 40-set or even 50-set workouts, the latter half of which will inevitably be junk volume-heavy and littered with abysmal SFRs. \u2022 Instead, it would be better to put half of your body on maintenance vol- umes, then train the other half from MEV to MRV for a few mesocycles in a row (a training block), switch, and then repeat for long-term total body growth that occurs in spurts rather than on a continuous basis. These are the best reasons to consider prioritization. Now, let\u2019s take a look at the six steps of how to do it. Page 50 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 48 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups 6 STEPS FOR PRIORITIZING MUSCLE GROUPS STEP 1: Train the prioritized muscle from its local MEV to its local MRV. Systemic fatigue should not be the limiting factor here. In other words, make sure that your inability for that muscle to keep making PRs at the ends of"

    "text": "your mesocycles is occurring because the muscle itself is being wiped out, not your cardiovascular abilities or other systemic contributors. Relative to this specific point, remember that muscle fatigue causes growth. Systemic fatigue reduces growth. STEP 2: Train the prioritized muscle first in most of its weekly sessions. If you tell someone you\u2019re really prioritizing your back, your back better be the first thing trained in most of your upper body sessions. Otherwise, you\u2019re not really prioritizing it at all. Training a muscle first or early in most sessions means you train it fresh with as much energy dedicated to causing a muscle growth stimulus as possible. This also gives you the best chance of never accumulating any amount of junk volume for your prioritized muscle group, as every set is likely to be if very high quality. STEP 3: Consider training it the hardest after a day off each week. For example, if Sunday is your rest day, that means that your session on Monday would feature your prioritized muscle group being trained first and likely hardest when compared to your other weekly training sessions. STEP 4: Choose exercises that have the highest RSMs with SFRs considered but not exclusively. Raw stimulus magnitude (RSM) is the total amount of muscle-growth signal you send to a muscle. In the context of full-body training, the SFR is more important because it takes fatigue into account, which prevents the fatigue overflow of some muscles from affecting others. But, if you are prioritizing a certain muscle group, there is some logic to allowing plenty of room for it to accumulate loads of fatigue while reducing your training volume potential for other muscles, since you\u2019re not pushing them as hard anyway and don\u2019t need as much volume allotted to them at the time. To keep it simple, think Page 51 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 49 13. How do you prioritize muscle groups of it like a monetary budget. If you really value eating out at classy, high-end restau- rants, you might have to create more room in your budget for eating out by limiting the amount of money you spend on clothes each month. It\u2019s a give and take. In short, it might not be the worst idea to smash your target muscle group with enough high RSM movements and loads to drive maximum growth (even if it comes at the temporary expense of other muscle groups growing at their fastest). STEP 5: Increase the frequency of training for your prioritized muscles toward the higher range of what is sustainable. If you normally train biceps two times per week, for example, prioritizing them may lead you to increase their frequency to three times per week. STEP 6: Reduce your training of the most interfering muscle groups to MEV or even MV. Reducing the training of the most systemically and/or axially-fatiguing muscles is usually wise when prioritizing other muscles. The most common instance of this would be reducing your leg and back training, for example, if you want to bring up other muscles. Ultimately, you should reduce as many muscles to MEV or MV as you need to in order to have lots of energy to train the prioritized muscles. Unfortunately, reducing all other muscles by a mere set or two per week probably won\u2019t offer you much (if any) additional training capacity in most cases. Lastly, consider synergists as well. If your goal is maximum triceps growth, take a look at your pressing movements for chest and reduce them as much as needed (often down to MV volumes) to make sure the triceps are nearly always either recovering from a hard triceps session or are fresh and ready to be trained hard again, instead of recovering from assisting the chest in hard chest training. If you\u2019re prioritizing more of your muscles, have larger and stronger muscles, and are more advanced, you\u2019ll need to put more muscles into MEV or MV volumes to buy enough \u201cfatigue clearance room\u201d to make the conditions best for growth for your prioritized muscles.

Page 52 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 50 14. PREVENTING AND MANAGING INJURIES You can\u2019t ever make the gym a completely safe place to be. Steel is heavy and hard, and when it falls, sometimes people get hurt. But, through your approach to training, you can do things as intelligently as possible while reducing the chance of injury. Here are four tips on how to do just that in your muscle growth training plan: Tip 1: Don\u2019t be an idiot. \u25cf Always warm up, and be sure to keep your technique as clean as possible. \u25cf Avoid pointless gym challenges and lifting heavy at random. In other words, when your slightly crazy training partner asks you, \u201cDo you think we could curl 225 if we both grabbed the barbell at the same time?\u201d, your best bet is to politely decline for the sake of an extended training career. \u25cf Don\u2019t lift any loads you can\u2019t handle for at least 5 very controlled reps. You\u2019re a bodybuilder! Not a powerlifter. Page 53 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 51 14. Preventing and managing injuries Tip 2: Ramp up your volumes and loads slowly. \u25cf Add no more than 1-2 sets per muscle group per session. Rapid volume increases have been correlated very tightly with injuries that tend to occur just after an abrupt escalation, so increase your sets slowly. \u25cf Add no more load than reduces your RIR by one in each week. In most cases, this means going up by 5-10 pounds. Don\u2019t slap an extra 45 pounds on the bar because \u201cyou feel like it.\u201d Being patient will notably reduce your injury risk. \u25cf Don\u2019t train with overlapping soreness often. Training with microdamage may predispose you to injury. If you train with overlapping soreness on occasion, don\u2019t add any more sets to the session you\u2019re doing or to the one before its next week\u2019s equivalent so that you\u2019re not doing more when you already can\u2019t recover from doing the normal. Tip 3: Pay attention. \u25cf If a certain technique hurts your joints more and more with each rep or set, pause, rack the weight, reevaluate, and make a change if the pain continues. Page 54 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 52 14. Preventing and managing injuries Tip 4: Deload like you\u2019re supposed to. \u25cf Don\u2019t skip the deload or cut it short! Deloads can be boring but your body needs them to literally heal. Skipping or cutting a deload short may be asking for trouble in the form of injury in your next mesocycle. \u25cf Don\u2019t add work during your deload cause you\u2019re itching to train. Deloads are supposed to be easy and low-volume. If your deload isn\u2019t super easy, it\u2019s not much of a deload. In fact, it\u2019s just another week of hard training where your fatigue doesn\u2019t really fall much in preparation for the next mesocycle, which is both rather unproductive and arguably dangerous. Failing to deload properly will cause fatigue to accumulate much faster than anticipated in that next mesocycle, which will undoubtedly lead to problems including an increased risk of injury. Hopefully, you will take all of this insight into account and never get hurt. But, because the nature of hypertrophy training is one of overload and pushing beyond limits with heavy weights, injury for almost everyone at some point in the game is nearly inevitable. If and when you do get hurt, please give the following steps a look before you make your next move. But before you read through the following steps, please remember that when you\u2019re hurt in a certain muscle or joint but still want to train other muscles that use other joints, make sure the rest of your training doesn\u2019t bother the injury to any meaningful extent. This way, you\u2019re not just continuously re-aggravating the injury and not letting it heal completely. Page 55 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 53 14.

    "text": "cleared for activity, start with sets of 20-30 reps at 5-10 RIR and work on your range of motion. You can end this phase of training when you can perform a full range of motion for the movement or joint without pain. 3. When you can navigate the injured area pain-free with a normal range of motion, work up to 3-0 RIR in 20-30-rep sets but only for a few sets a few times per week. Page 56 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 54 14. Preventing and managing injuries Just-injured tissues have very poor volume tolerance, so doing a bit fewer sets like 1-2 per session 2-3 times per week is better than doing more sets. 4. Add sets and cycle from MEV to MRV in the 20-30 rep range. This is done once you\u2019re very comfortably recovering from just a few sets of 20-30 reps. 5. Once you\u2019ve spent time training comfortably and pain-free in the higher rep ranges, slowly add load to some of those sets to get into the 10-20 range. Add load slowly and let the reps fall by two or so per session in most cases. Don\u2019t just jump from your 30RM to your 10RM unless you want to get hurt again. 6. Keep slowly adding load, and eventually dip back into the 5-10 range. Once you\u2019ve been there for a few weeks, deload, and then you should be in the clear to resume your normal training protocols. Page 57 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 55 15. MATCHING YOUR TRAINING TO YOUR DIET Making sure your eating matches your training is critical for the best muscle growth results. After all, muscle growth is fueled by food, and your muscle tissue is literally made of the chemicals you consume from food. In most cases, matching your training to your diet comes down to identifying your primary goal. Usually, there are three main options: training to gain as much muscle as possible via a caloric surplus, training to maintain via isocaloric dieting, and training for fat loss and muscle retention via a caloric deficit. Page 58 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 56 15. Matching your training to your diet If you\u2019re trying to gain as much muscle as possible, your best bet is to train across the entire volume spectrum. In nearly all cases, this means starting your mesocycles at your best guess of your MEV and finishing them around your MRV. And obviously, it\u2019s import- ant to make sure that your diet matches the level of focus and intensity you are bringing to your training sessions, which almost certainly implies eating in a caloric surplus. If you\u2019re already eating in a caloric surplus to gain muscle, you have to make sure you\u2019re actually training hard enough to grow muscle. Unfortunately, less voluminous training with lots of surplus food will predictably cause fat gain you might not be interested in. And, as you might imagine, this is a mistake many well-intentioned lifters have made over the years. If you\u2019re eating simply to maintain, you can still definitely train from your MEV to your MRV in an attempt to gain as much muscle as possible. However, unless you\u2019re a begin- ner, this approach probably won\u2019t yield as much growth as you\u2019d like since eating at maintenance fails to account for one of the biggest ingredients in the recipe for optimal gains: a caloric surplus. If you really want to gain as much muscle as possible and you are justifiably lean enough to do so, your best bet is to structure your food intake in context of a caloric surplus. That being said, sometimes eating and training to maintain your current body composition is the most appropriate thing. For example, if you need a break from hard, high-volume training and you want to train at your MV for a while, eating at maintenance is ideal. This would also be true for anyone currently in an active rest phase and in a deload no matter the phase. Lastly, if you\u2019re dieting to lose fat, training from your MEV to your MRV is a wise idea to preserve as much muscle as possible. If you don\u2019t train hard enough, you will likely (and very unfortunately) lose muscle in hypocaloric conditions. That being said, a few more intricate tips about progressions apply"

Make smaller load and rep jumps between sessions as your adaptive abilities will be worsened and your fatigue accumulation will occur more quickly than usual. 2. Expect your MRV to come down to you. If your usual MRV for back training is, let\u2019s say, about 20 sets per week, you might be surprised to find that your MRV for back training during a fat loss phase is only 16 sets per week. If you autoregulate your training, this will occur automatically (and this is one of the best reasons to autoregulate your training). But definitely don\u2019t go chasing your hypercaloric MRV while on a deficit as it will almost certainly be out of your reach. 3. Don\u2019t prioritize any muscle groups, and train all the ones you don\u2019t want to lose size on at MEV+. If you prioritize muscle groups during a fat loss phase, your body doesn\u2019t really have the food to make a lot of gains anyway, and the reduction of your non-prioritized muscles to MV may result in significant losses for them. Page 60 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 58 16. TROUBLESHOOTING LACK OF PROGRESS There could be many reasons you\u2019re not seeing the results you want, but the biggest reason most people experience a \u201clack of progress\u201d is that they\u2019re expecting linear gains like they made when they were a beginner. And yet, because they\u2019re more advanced now, they should actually be expecting gains of diminishing magnitudes. The second biggest reason you might not be getting the gains you want is just genetics. Not all of us were built to get 20-inch arms, and dare I say many of us were built for accomplishments slightly more beneficial to society! If you\u2019ve made peace with your training age and your genetics, there may be some other factors to attend to that can improve your results. Here are eight such factors: 1. Appropriate and consistent training and diet If you\u2019re inconsistent, the inconsistency is the problem with your gains. Only when you can fit together tight strings of completed workouts over days, weeks, and months will you see your best gains. So, if a lack of consistency is something that has been holding you back from making your best strides forward, this is certainly the most obvious factor to address. 2. MEV-MRV training for each muscle group targeted Do you know if you\u2019re hitting your MRV on your calves? If you\u2019ve never taken their training volume high enough to stall them out, you don\u2019t actually know. But seriously, how many people actually know what their MRV is for their calves? Page 61 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 59 16. Troubleshooting lack of progress For all you know, they might benefit from much more volume than you\u2019re cur- rently training them with, and no amount of extra intensity will make up for that. If you\u2019re curious about a muscle group, slowly raise the number of sets you train it with and see where growth is best. It might be higher than you think! On the contrary, you might be smashing your pecs with just-around-MRV or even higher volumes. You can instead reduce the amount of training you do for pecs that barely gets them pumped and a bit sore, and see if training at that level or just above it causes better gains. If the gains are no better, slowly raise the amount of volume you\u2019re doing and see where the best workouts occur. They might be at much smaller volumes than you\u2019re used to, and you might get better growth by doing less. In either case, the sweet spot is to be between your MEV and MRV, not flirting on the edges in either particular direction. 3. Getting fatigue management in line If you\u2019re not sleeping enough to be well-rested (usually 7-9 hours per night), if intense levels of stress are killing your energy levels, and if you don\u2019t have regular times during most days to unwind, you may not be gaining at your best rates. 4. Making sure your chosen exercises have high SFRs and especially high RSMs Don\u2019t just go"

    "text": "through the motions! If an exercise has a low SFR for you, try another one. Use movements that give you the best SFRs and the highest RSMs for lagging muscle groups so that you know you\u2019re using the best weapons for the battle. For example, it would be odd to complain about suboptimal hamstring growth if you\u2019ve never even tried most of the best hamstring exercises. Be logical in your exercise selection, and always be willing to make changes to your plan as certain exercises ebb and flow between varied levels of perceived effectiveness. 5. Making sure SFR is high via the right rep ranges per muscle Some muscles get very high SFRs going heavy while other muscles seem to bene- fit more from lighter training. If you notice you\u2019re experiencing crazy pumps, burns and fatigue from a given rep range and not as much from other rep ranges for a certain muscle, do the logical thing and bias a bit more of your training toward the rep range that seems most effective. For example, doing leg presses for sets of 5-10 might just hurt your knees and never really seem to stimulate your quads much. On the other hand, doing leg Page 62 HYPERTROPHY MADE SIMPLE 60 16. Troubleshooting lack of progress presses for sets of 20 might absolutely destroy your quads in the best way pos- sible. If you had never tried the higher rep range in this case, you might have erroneously written off the leg press as a low SFR exercise. In other words, be willing to explore multiple rep ranges across your movement patterns in order to identify which ones will be the most conducive for hypertrophy. 6. Being hypercaloric in gain phases and adding net bodyweight over months and years If you want to be jacked, and all of the lifters you look up to that are jacked weigh over 180 pounds, there\u2019s really no way you\u2019re going to wind up looking jacked if you only weigh 160 pounds. Unless, of course, you\u2019re in a hypercaloric condition and are actually gaining net tissue as you move up slowly to 180 pounds! Don\u2019t fall for the \u201cgaintaining\u201d folly. Instead, gain weight slowly and steadily if you want to be bigger. 7. Attending to training-side fatigue management Training manipulations that reduce cumulative fatigue such as deloads, active rests, and low-volume phases are critical in programming, especially when you\u2019re not a beginner anymore. A very common \u201cinstant PR\u201d formula is to take a late beginner or early intermedi- ate and have them do a deload or active rest for the first time. A few weeks later, they\u2019re almost always making astonishing strength and size gains. As easy as it is to sleep on your recovery and fatigue management, properly implementing such phases is an incredible way to problem-solve any lack of progress. 8. Making all the above changes for long enough It\u2019s easy to say you tried the changes but they \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d if you only tried to implement them for a few days or weeks. That\u2019s kind of like jumping into a caloric deficit for four days and then saying your new diet \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d because the scale only noted a decrease of a few tenths of a pound across your 96-hour experiment. If you really want the best results, implement some of these troubleshooting tips for months and it\u2019s very likely your gains will return.

HOW DO YOU CHOOSE EXERCISES? The most important principle in strength training is specificity. You train the lifts you want to get strong at so that the practice of training them makes you stronger at those specific movements. For example, if you want to improve your shoulder pressing strength, doing plenty of shoulder pressing in your training is probably a good idea. That being said, you don\u2019t only have to train the lifts you want to get stronger at by themselves. You can train other exercises that: \u25cf Are of a similar movement pattern to your chosen lifts \u2022 An example of this would be supplementing your barbell shoulder pressing goals with a dumbbell shoulder press. \u25cf Grow or make stronger certain muscles that contribute to the specific lift \u2022 An example of this would be incorporating overhead extensions to make your triceps bigger and stronger for improved shoulder press strength. \u25cf Make portions of the movement stronger that contribute to the specific lift. \u2022 An example of this would be doing good mornings to get stronger in the squat since good mornings improve your ability to keep your back straight and upright when squatting. So when you find yourself wondering which exercises you should be using to achieve your goals, the first part of that answer will always be something to the extent of what- ever is specific to the exercise itself. Page 4 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 2 1. How do you choose exercises This is the value of the principle of specificity. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE EXERCISES? Or, phrased slightly differently, the exercises you choose to feature in your training program can be the specific exercises you want to improve or exercises that train the muscles or sub-movements that can be known to be limiting factors to the performance of the primary exercise of focus. When we use the term limiting factors, we mean that if you improve a certain compo- nent of the exercise or muscles involved, then the exercise itself will improve. An easy example is training your grip to increase your deadlift ability. If your grip strength is, in fact, limiting your ability to deadlift more weight, improving your grip strength will improve your deadlift numbers right away. Page 5 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 3 1. How do you choose exercises The second part of the answer to \u201cwhat exercise should I choose\u201d is simply whichever one has a higher SFR. SFR stands for stimulus to fatigue ratio. STIMULUS TO FATIGUE RATIO STIMULUS FATIGUE By stimulus, we mean an exercise that places a high degree of tension on the target muscles and is not needlessly demanding on the joints or fatiguing to the whole body as a system. Some exercises, like dips, can be a bit too unstable to place the highest possible ten- sion on the target muscles and are thus best saved for muscle growth and not strength training. Other exercises, like the half-squat for leg strength, impose a lot of stress on the spinal musculature (way more than deep squats do) but don\u2019t have as powerful of an ability to impose tension on the leg muscles. Page 6 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 4 1. How do you choose exercises Additionally, some exercises get very \u201cgrooved in\u201d after a few sessions and are thus easy to train productively without second-guessing the movement pattern. For these exercises, we might say"

    "text": "that they have a higher SFR than exercises that feel awkward even after you\u2019ve learned to do them proficiently. Some exercises feel fine to begin with but beat up your joints and connective tissues too much, which increases overall fatigue too much and lowers the SFR. Lastly, some exercises, such as single-arm dumbbell preacher curls, are not very safe to load heavily, and thus have a poor SFR because the stimulus side (high tension) can never safely be presented over weeks of training. In light of all of these possibilities, what you will find is that choosing exercises that put a lot of tension on the target muscles, don\u2019t beat up the joints and connective tissues too much, are comfortable to train week after week, are safe to load heavily, and don\u2019t exhaust you entirely when you do them are the exercises with the highest SFRs and should be preferred when possible in your programming. While this is a wonderful consideration to keep in mind as a general rule, it doesn\u2019t mean you need to do only a few exercises in perpetuity. With any exercise, repeated exposures over weeks and months can cause it to turn stale, which technically means its SFR is declining. You can choose which exercises to keep in your program by abiding by the following three guidelines: 1. Exercises that give you great tension and let you lift heavy relative loads naturally should be kept in most (if not all) cases. 2. Exercises that are easier on your joints and are worth systemic fatigue because they make you considerably stronger over time should be kept in most (if not all) cases. 3. Exercises that are steadily climbing in strength over months of training should be kept in most (if not all) cases. Conversely, you should consider replacing any exercises that: 1. Are no longer \u201cgrooving\u201d and leave you feeling as though you\u2019re failing to generate super high forces in the right direction. 2. Are getting tough on your joints and zap your strength for the rest of your session upon completion. 3. Have plateaued in strength over the last month or so of your training.

How do you choose exercises QUALIT Y TENSION, LOW JOINT FATIGUE, STEADY PROGRESSIO N STIMULUS DISP LACED TENSION, HIGH FAT IGUE, HALTED PROG RESSIO N FATIGUE We\u2019ll cover this more in-depth later, but there is also a timing component to exercise selection. In the beginning of a macrocycle (a whole plan of strength training that ends in the testing of your 1RM), you might do mostly exercises that train subsystems and not the direct lift itself. For example, you might train lots of hack squats early in a squat-focused macrocycle to develop quad strength while doing minimal or even no squatting at all. Yet, as you near your 1RM testing day, you might do fewer subsystem exercises (otherwise known as \u201caccessory\u201d or \u201cassistance\u201d movements) and do lifts that mimic your 1RM lift more and more such as high-bar squats and eventually the very low-bar squats you\u2019ll be testing at the end. Page 8 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 6 2. WHAT IS PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE? Proper technique in lifting for strength has at least six unifying components, which are that the technique: 1. Utilizes the most muscle possible to generate the most force. \u2022 Another implication of this first point is that the technique is performed in positions in which the muscles are their strongest. \u2022 For example, the sternal portion of the pectoralis muscles is bigger and stronger than the clavicular portion, so arching the back in the bench press is a better technique for strength because it allows the sternal pecs to con- tribute more force to moving the bar. Page 9 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 7 2. What is proper lifting technique PROPER LIFTING TECHNIQUE Utilizes the most muscle possible to generate the most force. 2. Utilizes the leverage of the lift to move the highest loads. \u2022 For example, a low-bar squat positions the bar closer to your center of gravity and thus requires less knee flexion at the"

    "text": "bottom of the lift, which creates a shorter moment arm for the torso. In turn, this maximizes the potential to lift the heaviest weights. \u2022 Another example is that good deadlift technique requires you to keep the bar as close to your legs as possible on the ascent so that the moment arm of the torso is at its lowest and higher loads can be lifted. 3. Is not needlessly fatiguing, damaging, or unsafe in the short and long term. \u2022 For example, dive-bombing your squats can allow you to lift more, but it also magnifies injury risk substantially and makes the squat less sustainable. Page 10 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 8 2. What is proper lifting technique \u2022 \u201cCandy-cane rounding\u201d of your lower back in the deadlift might expose the spine to deleterious forces in its most vulnerable positions and may also not be a very sustainable practice. \u2022 Trying to bench press heavy with your legs up in the air can destabilize the lift and cause mis-grooves of bar position that lead to injury. 4. Can be replicated session to session for tracking. \u2022 The more you practice the same technique, the stronger you get at it. \u2022 You should be able to remember exactly where you put your hands, hips, feet, head, etc., so you can do the lift nearly identically each time you train it. 5. Is braced and stable. \u2022 Good technique nearly always features a super tight core that is achieved through proper bracing. \u2022 Good technique should also feature super stable feet, shoulders, and hands. For example, this could mean creating a stable shoulder shelf by moving your scapulae back in a movement like the squat. Using sturdy shoes and chalk to make sure maximum force transfer can occur is also a good idea. 6. Meets the competitive requirements of the lift. \u2022 Target lift technique must meet competition standards/rules if you\u2019re inter- ested in competing. For example, if you\u2019d like to powerlift someday, you should be squatting to below parallel by default. Doing anything else from a technique perspective simply doesn\u2019t make any sense in this case due to the specificity of the goal. \u2022 On the other hand, assistance lift technique: \u2013 Must challenge the muscle or movements being targeted. \u25aa Example 1: For muscle growth work to improve strength, the chosen technique should impose a high range of motion (ROM) and tension on the target muscle \u25aa Example 2: For sub-movement strength work, a proper ROM should be used to challenge the sub-movement. For example, creating a deep enough deficit in the deficit deadlift would be a sensible train- ing idea for anyone who struggles to move the weight from the floor in the competition deadlift. Page 11 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 9 3. HOW SHOULD YOU WARM UP? Before we address the how of warming up, let\u2019s chat about the why. Specifically, what does warming up do for you? As it turns out, warming up achieves a few very beneficial things. It makes the heavy lifting done after it less likely to cause injury by warming up the tissue and practicing the lift in a safe movement path. Secondly, it makes your technique more efficient and lets you lift greater loads, which gives you a bigger stimulus and causes more strength increases. Lastly, it fires up your nervous system and lets you lift heavier loads, similarly giving you a bigger stimulus that makes you stronger. Here are some implications for how you can warm up in practice: 1. You can choose to do easy cardio for 5-10 minutes. This is optional. 2. Begin with a 20RM+ weight for the first exercise and do it for around 10 reps. 3. Do at least one weight halfway between your 20RM+ weight and your planned working weight for a set of five reps or so. The heavier the lift, the more sets of 8,6,4, etc. you might need to do. \u25cf 0-50 pounds: 1 intermediate set \u25cf 50-200 pounds: 2 intermediate sets \u25cf 200-400 pounds: 3 intermediate sets \u25cf Continue this trend as needed for bigger weights.

This is generally the last warm up set before the first working set and is also referred to as the potentia- tion set because it potentiates your nervous system to produce its highest output and lets you use most/all of your strength on the upcoming working set. When warming up, you should aim to execute the exact lifting technique (bracing and all) for every single warm up rep, even if it looks silly. As the saying goes, practice like you play! As you progress through your training session, the above-described warm up protocol can be shortened a bit if the next lift is for a similar movement pattern. Here\u2019s an example of how you might warm up to doing squats for sets of five: \u25cf Warm Up Set 1: 45 pounds for 10 reps \u25cf Warm Up Set 2: 135 pounds for 6 reps \u25cf Warm Up Set 3: 225 pounds for 4 reps \u25cf Warm Up Set 4: 275 pounds for 2 reps \u25cf Potentiation Set: 300 pounds for 1 rep \u25cf Then you would begin your working sets of 5 reps at 300 pounds.

Page 14 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 12 4. HOW HEAVY SHOULD YOU LIFT? From a large combination of scientific research and practical insight, we can be relatively certain that strength training is best done at a certain percentage of your 1RM, otherwise known as a \u201cloading range\u201d or \u201crelative intensity.\u201d From this combination of research and practice, we know that lifting anything less than 80% of your 1RM can improve your strength but won\u2019t be very efficient per working set. In other words, you\u2019d have to do a lot of lighter sets to get as strong as just a few heavy sets could make you at a fraction of time investment and fatigue cost. Such lighter training can cause lots of muscle growth but isn\u2019t heavy enough to cause the best strength gains via nervous system adaptations. On the other hand, lifting anything over 92.5%+ of your 1RM also improves strength but not very efficiently per working set. In this case, you\u2019d need a ton of sets to cause a lot of strength improvement. That\u2019s not just a poor use of time, but it also would likely cause lots more joint and connective tissue fatigue and even increase your risk of acute injury. Such ultra-heavy training is essential for proper peaking of strength before a competition but not ideal for its core development. We can develop some rational loading recommendations by taking all of this under advisement. Page 15 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 13 4. How heavy should you lift RATIONAL LOADING RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Anything in the 80-92.5% range of your 1RM will cause great strength gains, which typically means doing challenging sets of roughly 3-6 reps. \u2022 This doesn\u2019t mean you have to do exactly 80-92.5%. People are different! The key is to find your challenging loads for sets of 3-6 reps because that\u2019s likely where you\u2019ll build the most strength. \u2022 Keep in mind too that you might need a bit more or less than 80-92.5% 1RM to challenge yourself with sets of 3-6 reps. 2. Some assistance work is best suited toward slightly higher reps such as sets of 5-8 reps, especially if the exercises are sin- gle-joint moves such as skull crushers or lateral raises. \u2022 This is for direct strength training because growing muscle for eventual strength development is best done with sets of 5-10 reps. We\u2019ll explore that in more depth later on. To keep things super simple, follow these guidelines to adjust your loads: \u25cf If you can do easy sets of 7+ reps,"

HOW LONG SHOULD YOU REST BETWEEN SETS? Okay, so now you know how heavy to go for each working set. But how many reps you can get in each set is hugely based on how long you rest between each set and the next, which begs the question: Is there a correct amount of time to rest between sets? Yes, there is! After a given working set, you should rest long enough until you can at least check the following boxes for yourself: 1. Your prime movers are no longer burning, crampy, or drained. 2. Your cardio will not be the limiting factor in your next set. 3. Your nervous system/psychology will not be the limiting factor on your next set. \u2022 In other words, you feel strong enough to hit your target reps with the given load. 4. No synergists will be the limiting factor on your next set. Page 17 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 15 5. How long should you rest between sets NO HOW LONG SHOULD YOU REST? REST ARE YOUR PRIME MOVERS RECOVERED? NO NO NO YES READY TO GO! IS YOUR BREATHING BACK TO NORMAL? DO YOU FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO PERFORM WELL? ARE OTHER ASSISTANCE MUSCLE GROUPS RECOVERED? YES YES YES Because your performance on each working set determines how much of a strength stimulus you\u2019ll benefit from, You can always tell the competitive weightlifters and powerlifters apart from everyone else at the gym because they rest so much longer than they actually lift. Page 18 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 16 5. How long should you rest between sets Let\u2019s see how this checklist system would play out with an example of you doing sets of five at 500 pounds if your rough 1RM were around 585 pounds. 1. Your prime movers are no longer burning, crampy, or drained. \u2022 60 seconds 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 Two minutes 3. Your nervous system/psychology will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 Five minutes 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. \u2022 60 seconds In this case, because your nervous system and psychology needed five minutes, that\u2019s how long you should take to rest at minimum, no matter how long the other factors took to satisfy. Now, let\u2019s see how much rest you\u2019d need if you lifted 350 pounds for sets of five instead of 500 pounds if you had the same strength. 1. Your prime movers are no longer burning, crampy, or drained. \u2022 45 seconds 2. Your cardio will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 90 seconds 3. Your nervous system/psychology will not limit you on the next set. \u2022 60 seconds 4. No synergists will limit you on the next set. \u2022 45 seconds Page 19 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 17 5. How long should you rest between sets The result is 90 seconds, which doesn\u2019t mean you have to do another set again as soon as that time elapses. Rather, it means that you should rest at least 90 seconds. If you have a limited amount of time in the gym that day, resting the 90-second minimum might be what\u2019s required to move through your session at an appropriate pace to finish. But, if you\u2019re not battling the clock, you might choose to rest two (or even three) minutes between sets simply to make the session feel less rushed. Page 20 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 18 6. HOW MANY SETS SHOULD YOU DO? To answer this question, you have to answer it in two ways. The first way to answer this question is to consider how many sets you should do per movement type (like a squat, a hinge, or a press) per session. The second way to answer this question is to consider how many total working sets you should do per session, which includes all movement types in that session combined. Let\u2019s answer them one at a time. HOW MANY SETS TO TRAIN PER MOVEMENT When training a given movement in a given session, you need to do enough sets of it to drive best strength adaptations, which means at least one heavy working set per session. In addition, the number of sets you do in your last week of a progression before taking a"

    "text": "week-long break to recover (known as a deload) should be close to the most work that you can recover from and benefit from, because any less would be a missed opportunity in most cases. Thus, if you could have benefitted from five sets of squats but you only did four, you left some strength on the table. You do want to push the limits, but not exceed them. If you do so many sets in a session that the last set fails to perform highly enough to meet minimum force requirements, that last set was a set too far. So, how do you know if you\u2019re underperforming? Page 21 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 19 6. How many sets should you do Here\u2019s a quick reference guide for the three different types of training you\u2019ll do in an advanced strength training program: For hypertrophy for strength development, you know that you are underperforming when you can\u2019t do sets of 5 to 10 with at least about 75% of your 1RM. For basic strength development, you know you are underperforming when you can\u2019t do sets of 3 to 6 with at least 82.5% of your 1RM. For limit strength development, you know that you are underper- forming when you can\u2019t do sets of 1 to 3 with at least about 87.5% of your 1RM. HYPERTROPHY FOR STRENGTH BASIC STRENGTH LIMIT STRENGTH 5-10 reps with at least 75% 1RM 3-6 reps with at least 82.5% 1RM 1-3 reps with at least 87.5% 1RM LOADING STANDARDS FOR STRENGTH TRAINING In essence, if you fail to perform to those minimum standards, you\u2019re so fatigued that you\u2019re moving weight around without stimulating much of anything. This sort of junk volume is going to accumulate to result in tons of fatigue but very little improvement and is something you should actively avoid. Page 22 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 20 6. How many sets should you do In essence, if you fail to perform to those minimum standards, you\u2019re so fatigued that you\u2019re moving weight around without stimulating much of anything. This sort of junk volume is going to accumulate to result in tons of fatigue but very little improvement and is something you should actively avoid. You\u2019ve also done too much work in a given session if you cannot recover to perform better in the next week\u2019s concomitant session. For example, if you hit a PR of 230 pounds for a top set of five reps last week and then did lots of other work sets after, you had better not have done so many sets after that next week you\u2019re too fatigued to do at least something like 235 pounds for a top set of five reps. Because if you\u2019re getting so tired that you literally cannot progress in strength, how in the world are you going to, well, progress in strength?! Often but not always, another sign that you might be doing too much volume is that you\u2019re still sore in the muscles you trained last time by the next time you are scheduled to train them again. For example, if you have a squat and SLDL session on Monday and a deadlift and hack squat session on Thursday but you\u2019re still sore in your lower back and quads by Thursday, you\u2019re probably doing too much on Monday. Strength training is about going hard in the gym and coming back recovered enough to go even harder next time. It\u2019s not just about \u201cleaving it all on the gym floor\u201d every time. In fact, many would consider that a well-intentioned but careless beginner mistake. To keep it simpler, we could refine these ideas down to the following points: 1. If you\u2019re not training very close to your heaviest, it\u2019s not going to make you much stronger. 2. If you\u2019re training so much that you can\u2019t hit a PR in the next week, you\u2019re training too much. 3. If you\u2019re training so much that you\u2019re still sore by the next session, you\u2019re training too much. 4. If you deload when you could have set another PR in the next week, you should be training with more sets per session or longer accumulation phases. Page 23 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 21 6. How many sets should you do Lastly, remember that per-movement volume includes sets from all exercises of a given movement pattern. So if you have three"

    "text": "sets of bench presses and three sets of incline dumbbell presses, that\u2019s six sets for the pressing movement, not just three. Be sure to keep that in mind as you do your best to make sense of specific volume numbers as they relate to your ability to recover and progress effectively across your training cycle. HOW MANY SETS TO TRAIN PER SESSION Now that per-movement volume is sorted, how many sets in total should you be doing per session? First, if any of the exercises fall much below the 75%, 82.5% or 87.5% lines for their respective 1RM zones, it\u2019s probably best practice to discontinue that session since doing anything more than that is likely junk volume (even if it feels heavy). It can feel heavy just because you\u2019re tired, not because it\u2019s challenging your body to get stronger. For example, if you can\u2019t hit a set of three with more than 82.5% of your fresh 1RM for an exercise, you\u2019re probably very fatigued and should shut the session down. The implication here is that you can only do so much work in a given strength training session before you\u2019re too tired to continue being productive. Typically, this results in some common numbers for most people to expect to come close to as they near their capabilities. For most lifters, between 2 and 5 sets per movement type per session seems to work best. And, much more than 15 heavy work sets in a total session drops most below the minimum loading thresholds and is thus excessive. Page 24 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 22 6. How many sets should you do SETS PER MOVEMENT TYPE: SETS PER SESSION: 2-5 SETS <15 SETS PRODUCTIVE SETS PER SESSION Page 25 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 23 7. HOW HARD SHOULD YOU TRAIN? For many, it can be difficult to understand what exactly \u201chard\u201d means in the context of strength training. When we use the term, we are suggesting that hard training means training close to your maximum abilities if you were to push each set to your absolute limits. But, what does the research say? Generally, it suggests that going all out shows no clear benefit over going very hard with some force in reserve. Going all out (which is here defined as giving a maximum effort on every set) all the time causes a lot of fatigue accumulation, which can prevent you from stringing together as many great workouts in a row as you could. On the other hand, training very far from your limits causes very poor gains. So the question then becomes the following: How can you make sure you give hard, but not excessive effort to each working set? For this question, we find it most helpful to use the Rating of Perceived Exertion, or RPE scale, which states the following: RPE 7 = \u201cThat was tough, but I very comfortably hit the goal weight and reps.\u201d RPE 8 = \u201cThat was very tough, but I had no problem hitting the goal weight and reps.\u201d RPE 9 = \u201cThat was super tough and a real struggle to hit the goal weight and reps.\u201d RPE 10 = \u201cIf there was so much as one extra pound on the bar, I would have missed my goal weight and reps no matter how hard I tried.\u201d Page 26 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 24 7. How hard should you train EXPERIENCING RPE RPE RPE 7 EXPERIENCE Tough, but comfortably hit weight and reps RPE 8 Very tough, but no problem hitting weight and reps RPE 9 Super tough and a struggle hitting weight and reps RPE 10 Maximal e\ufb00ort, no more room for any weight addition The RPE scale lets you approach your relative efforts with a logical structure. In most cases, something similar to the following example will prove beneficial for most lifters. 1. Start most accumulation phases (1-2 months of systematic progres- sions in both load and effort before a deload week) at your best estimate of RPE 7 and write down your weight and reps. 2. Add weight each week while trying to match reps from last week. \u2022 Week 1: 100 lbs for 5, 5, 5 (RPE 7-ish) \u2022 Week 2: 105 lbs for 5, 5, 5 (RPE 8-ish) \u2022 Week 3: 110 lbs for 5, 5, 5 (RPE 9-ish) \u2022 Week 4: 115 lbs for 5, 5, 5 (RPE 10-ish) 3.

At that point it will be time to take a break and restart the process stronger than you were when you began the first phase. \u2022 Week 5: 120lbs for 5, 5, 4 (last set of 5 a miss at RPE 10) \u2022 Week 6: Deload training to recover and prepare for a second training cycle. Page 27 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 25 8. HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN? Similar to the section on volume, we have to answer this question both for each move- ment type and for the total number of training sessions in the week. As a bit of a recap, remember that movement type refers to broader interpretations of human movement patterns such as a squatting motion, a hinging motion, a pressing motion, or a pulling motion. Generally, you can train the same movement type again later in the week when you can add load to the bar and successfully complete your target reps. This is also done best when the muscles involved have healed from last time\u2019s imposed soreness. How often that is depends on how hard you train each session. Page 28 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 26 8. How often should you train TIME PERFORMANCE STIMULUS ADAPTATION RECOVERY HOMEOSTATIC DISRUPTION TRAIN AGAIN HERE HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU TRAIN? For example, if you do three sets per session, this might mean four sessions per week. But if you do four sets per session, this might mean three sessions per week. In most cases, anything under 2-4 sets per session might best be combined into fewer sessions since it\u2019s just not worth the time and fatigue of warming up that many times per week. On the other hand, most movement types of more than 8 sets per session should be split up to increase the amount of weight lifted in your average set and thus increase the strength stimulus. Most often, the result is that a per-movement frequency of 2-4x per muscle per week is great depending on individual recovery rates and how demanding each session is. Higher frequencies are possible in some cases, but they should be done for limited periods of time due to the risk of unsustainability over months of training. Page 29 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 27 8. How often should you train The total number of sessions per week that can be done hinges first and foremost on adherence. To help you make sense of your own training frequency, utilize this guide based on training age. For the purposes of this guide, we consider beginners as people who have trained for strength for 0-3 years, intermediates as those who have trained for 3-7 years, and advanced athletes as those who have been training for more than seven years. TRAINING FREQUENCY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, AND ADVANCED ATHLETES Beginners: 2-4 total sessions per week The most important thing to consider with beginners is that you don\u2019t want to burn them out in the process. In fact, you want to ignite desire for more! Additionally, nearly all beginners will make incredible progress on very low frequencies. And in most cases, full body training splits will be featured on these lower frequencies. Intermediates: 3-6 total sessions per week Intermediates are unlikely to burn out because they\u2019ve already proven to love the training process. At this point, they need more sessions to do each movement justice. This is where more complicated splits like push/pull/legs, upper/lower, etc. become more common. Page 30 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 28 8. How often should you train Advanced: 5-10 total sessions per week For advanced athletes, each movement needs to be first in its session at least once a week to improve as optimally as possible. In fact, training only one or two movements per session is very common as much more can often lead into junk volume territory. Additionally, emphasis and de-emphasis can be employed for those who can only train 5-6 days per week. This means that such lifters might focus on squats and deadlifts for a few months while bench pressing stays at maintenance (done last in sessions and with only enough volume"

    "text": "and load to maintain performance but not improve it), and then switch later to emphasizing squats and benches while dead- lifting stays at maintenance. Finally, twice-daily sessions can take you up to 10 sessions per week total if desired, but this is almost reserved for competitors or those who might consider themselves \u201chardcore.\u201d Page 31 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 29 9. HOW SHOULD YOU PROGRESS? When you begin an accumulation phase in any given mesocycle, you need to choose a weight for each exercise in its target rep range, which is generally: \u25cf 5-10 for strength-focused hypertrophy mesocycles \u25cf 3-6 for basic strength mesocycles \u25cf 1-3 for limit strength/peaking mesocycles From here, the idea is to program enough sets for each movement type so that you estimate that you\u2019ll reach your maximum ability to recover (your maximum recoverable volume or MRV) at the end of the accumulation phase. This, however, is certainly a skill to be developed, so simply make your best guess to start. After a few mesocycles, you\u2019ll know your body well enough to make increasingly educated estimations of your MRV. If you\u2019re very unsure, it\u2019s better to be conservative and err on the side of underestimating your MRV rather than overestimating your MRV. Once you\u2019ve estimated your MRV and written out your programming accordingly, it\u2019s time to start lifting and progressing. As we mentioned before, it\u2019s probably best practice to start your accumulation phases with weights that land you in your target rep range at an RPE 7 for the first week. Page 32 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 30 9. How should you progress Write down your weight and reps for each set in every session. Then, for your second week of training, come back and add enough weight to keep the RPE the same or raise it by one. For example: \u25cf Week 1: 100 pounds for 5 reps at RPE 7 \u25cf Week 2: 110 pounds for for 5 reps at RPE 8 A hard rule here is that your next week needs to beat your performance from last week. Beating your performance, in this case, could mean improving it by a small margin at the same RPE or by more but only as much as 1 RPE higher. In other words, don\u2019t make an aggressive jump from RPE 7 to RPE 10 in a single week! If you get to your last week of training before you deload and you\u2019re completely fatigued to the extent that there is no way you can hit another PR next week, that\u2019s great! You\u2019re right around your MRV and your volume estimations are on point. On the other hand, if you feel like you can probably PR again (even if only by a little) next week because you\u2019re just not that fatigued, deload anyway but raise the average volume (number of sets for that movement type) in your next mesocycle by a set and repeat this process. Page 33 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 31 10. WHEN AND HOW SHOULD YOU DELOAD? As you add weight and potentially sets to your sessions from week to week, you will inevitably reach the point of being unable to beat your performance from the week prior. When this happens, you will need to respond with some form of implemented recovery protocol. If this happens to just one of the movement patterns you have in your program but not the others, you can simply deploy a recovery session. Here\u2019s how to do that: 1. Finish the session strong. 2. In the next planned session for that movement and muscle group, do all the planned sets at the planned reps but at half of the planned weight. \u2022 For example, if you were supposed to bench press 240 pounds for 9, 8, 7, 6, you would bench press 120 pounds for 9, 8, 7, 6 instead. 3. Resume the sessions in the week after at the same number of planned sets and keep progressing as you were in weight. \u2022 If we keep the same example from our second point, this means the week following your recovery session would be the time to attempt 240 pounds for 9, 8, 7, 6. 4. Add weight from there as you normally would. Page 34 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 32 10. When and how should you deload Recovery sessions like this can buy you another"

    "text": "week or two of progression by reducing your fatigue. It\u2019s certainly an effective strategy, but it will only carry you so far since the fatigue from your other movements will still be accumulating all the while. At some point, after about 3-6 weeks of training in most cases, several of your trained movement patterns will require recovery sessions. And eventually, your entire mind and body will feel beat up, your per-session RPEs will be crazy high, and you will begin to underperform (fail to beat last week\u2019s numbers) on nearly all of your movements at the same time. As you approach these colliding levels of fatigue, you will need to bring both your sys- temic and localized fatigue back down significantly by deloading. To deload, do the following for one whole week: 1. In the first half of the week, do the same number of sets and reps as the week before but at only 70% of last week\u2019s weight. 2. In the second half of the week, do the same number of sets and reps as the week before, but at only 50% of last week\u2019s weight. This should clear enough fatigue to allow you to train hard for another whole mesocycle. After your deload week, follow instructions from section nine of this guide and begin climbing your way up to higher training volumes once again. Page 35 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 33 11. HOW SHOULD YOU PLAN TRAINING PHASES? As we\u2019ve already demonstrated, productive training happens best by making each suc- cessive week systematically harder. And, when you can string multiple weeks of productive training together, this is called an accumulation phase. As we just learned, a deload week is what you deploy to drop the fatigue that accumu- lates during your accumulation phase, and the two together (an accumulation phase plus a deload week) make up what we refer to as a mesocycle. As we move up the timescale, anywhere from 1-3 mesocycles of the same kind of train- ing add up to what we call a block of training. At this point in the guide, we\u2019ve already alluded to there being 3 primary types of training blocks, but now is the time to discuss them in a more explicit, detailed format. 3 SPECIFIC KINDS OF TRAINING HYPERTROPHY FOR STRENGTH PURPOSES \u25cf This kind of training is accomplished through sets of 5-10 reps. \u25cf These should be exercises that grow the most muscle but also convert well to strength moves. \u25cf This kind of training allows for slightly higher training volumes. Page 36 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 34 11. How should you plan training phases BASIC STRENGTH \u25cf Basic strength training should be accomplished through sets of 3-6 reps. \u25cf These should be exercises that increase strength the most and are very similar to (or the same as) competition/goal exercises. \u25cf This kind of training allows for normal strength training volumes as discussed in earlier sections of this guide. PEAKING \u25cf This kind of training is accomplished through sets of 1-3 reps. \u25cf Sets of 3-6 reps at RPEs of 3-6 can also be done for technique work between hard sessions. \u25cf In terms of exercise selection, these should be mostly if not exclusively competition exercises. \u25cf When peaking, intensities should range from RPE 7 to RPE 9. \u25cf In the final week of peaking, RPEs should range from 3-6. \u25cf Volume in a peaking phase declines during most weeks. Essentially, during a peaking phase, your volume progresses from normal strength volumes to no training at all as you prepare to max out and set a new PR. SEQUENCING TRAINING BLOCKS Most strength training macrocycles are sequenced as follows: a hypertrophy block, then a strength block, then a peaking block. They are ordered like this because of the principle of phase potentiation , which is the idea that, for best long-term performances, certain training qualities need to be Page 37 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 35 11. How should you plan training phases developed ahead of others since the latter qualities are based on the former. The former qualities potentiate, or improve, the end result of the latter qualities.

    "text": "strength training, we potentiate strength phases with hypertrophy phases because, if you build more muscle first, you have more muscle to make stronger. Then, the peaking phase follows the strength phase because it doesn\u2019t make any sense to peak your strength if you haven\u2019t dedicated yourself to a season of improving your strength in the first place. By analogy, the hypertrophy phase is like the underground foundation of a skyscraper, the strength phase is like the main floors, and the peaking phase is like the spire at the top. To build the tallest skyscraper you can, you need to focus on building a sturdy base to support the main floors to come. If you fail to build a solid base, not as many main floors can be built above ground with stability. Once you have the main floors on top of the base, only then do you add the spire on top. A spire placed on ground level doesn\u2019t make for a very impressive structure. Without a spire, the skyscraper is primarily made up of its main floors. It might be relatively tall and impressive, but it will never be as grand and awe-inspiring as would be with a spire. In strength training terms, phase potentiation looks like this: 1. Put on muscle through the use of a hypertrophy block. 2. Make that new muscle stronger through the use of a basic strength block. 3. Peak for max performance through the use of a peaking block. 4. Compete or max out at the gym. 5. Take an active rest phase, which is essentially 1-2 weeks of super easy training or even no formal training at all to heal both physically and psychologically for the next macrocycle of training. 6. And then repeat! Page 38 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 36 11.

If you\u2019re not yet ready or interested in competition, you don\u2019t have to peak if you don\u2019t want to. You can just do hypertrophy and strength blocks back to back with an active rest on occasion to get amazing long-term strength gains. After all, you can always incorporate a peaking phase if you decide you\u2019re ready to enter into the competitive realm of strength sport. Page 39 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 37 12. BEGINNER VS. INTERMEDIATE VS. ADVANCED TRAINING Different training approaches can change based on your level of advancement in lifting. The key is to figure out which category applies to you. Beginner \u25cf You just lift and you keep getting stronger automatically without much complexity. \u25cf You get stronger every single mesocycle of training. \u25cf You\u2019re most likely to have lifted for 0-3 years, though if the above two points apply to you, you\u2019re still a beginner even more than 3 years into your lifting career. Intermediate \u25cf You\u2019ve hit your first plateau and had to navigate around it. \u25cf You need to nail the basics consistently to keep progressing. \u25cf You get a little stronger in most mesocycles of training, but, on occasion, you have a mesocycle or two where no clear evidence of strength gain is present, especially during hypertrophy blocks. \u25cf You\u2019re most likely to have lifted for 3-7 years, though it could be less or more. Page 40 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 38 12. Beginner vs. Intermediate vs. Advanced Training Advanced \u25cf If your sleep, recovery, nutrition, and training isn\u2019t meticulous and well-planned, you simply don\u2019t make strength gains. \u25cf You actually temporarily decline in predicted 1RM strength during hypertrophy blocks, regain the lost strength early on in strength mesocycles, gain perhaps a little bit of predicted strength in your last strength mesocycle of the strength block, and make most of your apparent gains in your peaking phase. \u25cf You\u2019re most likely to have lifted for 7+ years, though it could be less or"

Once you\u2019ve made your choice, or, if you train other individuals who are of a certain advancement in their training age, you can incorporate some of the following training recommendations for each level: Beginner athletes should: 1. Do mostly sets of 5-10 reps. 2. Focus mostly on the compound basics or just a few basic exercises. 3. Focus tons on improving and solidifying their technique. 4. Avoid training at RPE 10 as the technique breakdown here can cause the accidental learning of bad technique. 5. Avoid near-MRV volumes. 6. Train full-body 3-4x per week. Page 41 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 39 12. Beginner vs. Intermediate vs. Advanced Training Intermediate athletes should: 1. Do mostly sets of 5-10 and sets of 3-6 while peaking with sets of 1-3 (but not peaking too often). 2. Try lots of different exercises to see which SFRs are best for them. 3. Focus on altering their basic techniques to fit their personal SFRs. 4. Push from RPE 7-10 in most mesocycles while focusing on breaking barriers toward the end of each mesocycles. 5. Train from MEV to MRV in most mesocycles. 6. Train each movement type 2-4x per week across 4-6 total sessions. Advanced athletes should: 1. Do mostly sets of 3-6 while only utilizing sets of 5-10 when needing to reclaim size or move up a weight class. 2. Focus mostly on the best SFR exercises for them. \u2022 Advanced athletes should vary their rep ranges and move- ments to manage fatigue within the week. 3. Perform most of their training between RPE 8-9. \u2022 Unfortunately, RPE 7 might be too easy for advanced athletes to get their best gains from. \u2022 Training to an RPE 10 is permissible, but it should be on rare occasions because of the very high levels of fatigue and potential for injury it generates. Page 42 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 40 12. Beginner vs. Intermediate vs. Advanced Training 4. Train each movement pattern 2-3x per week across 5-10 ses- sions with twice-per-day sessions used in a phasic manner over the block. \u2022 Due to such high degrees of strength in some advanced athletes, they often can\u2019t do too many sets in one session productively.

HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE SPECIFIC LIFTS? You may want to prioritize specific lifts for an additional increase in strength, but you must understand that such prioritization always results in a tradeoff between different lifts. When you focus intensely on one or several lifts at a time, you can certainly expect to improve your gains for those specific exercises, but the consequence is that you will inevitably make less progress (or even just maintain strength) among the exercises you are forced to place on the back burner. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no way to magically maximize all of your lifts at the same time. That being said, if you\u2019re willing to accept the pros and cons of specialization phases, here is the best way to do it in six concise points. 1. Firstly, do a hypercaloric hypertrophy phase for the supporting muscles of the movements you intend to isolate. Remember, the best way to improve your per- formance in the bench press is to grow bigger triceps and a bigger chest. 2. Train the prioritized lift (or the muscles that support it) more often, usually with one extra session per week more than usual. For"

    "text": "example, if you normally squat 2x per week and you want to prioritize squats, try to reconfigure your program in a way that allows you to squat 3x per week. 3. Train other lifts (and muscle groups) with less volume. \u2022 This is especially relevant if the muscles are used heavily in both lifts. For example, if you want to increase your bench press, you might need Page 44 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 42 13. How do you prioritize specific lifts to reduce your shoulder pressing volume since both of those movements heavily recruit the shoulders and the triceps. 4. Train the prioritized lift first in most of its weekly sessions. If you say you want to prioritize your deadlift, but you always train it after squatting, you have a conflict of interest. 5. Consider training it the hardest after each week\u2019s days off. For example, if you always take Sundays off, it\u2019s probably a good idea to train your movement of emphasis first (and hardest) on Mondays. 6. Choose the exercises that have the highest RSM. And, although you should cer- tainly consider the SFRs for these same movements, it\u2019s probably best practice to prioritize exercises with the best RSMs and work around the resulting fatigue. In case that acronym is new to you, RSM stands for raw stimulus magnitude, and it represents only the stimulus portion of the SFR, not the fatigue portion. Thus, if deficit deadlifts really boost your deadlift but also result in an enormous amount of systemic fatigue, it makes good sense to keep them in if you\u2019re prioritizing your deadlift, but you might have to lower your heavy squatting and overall posterior chain volume enough in other areas of your program to make room for them.

PREVENTING AND MANAGING INJURIES As important as it is to be aware of injury prevention, you\u2019ll never be able to make the gym a completely safe place to be. Steel is heavy and hard, and when it falls, sometimes people get hurt. But, you can reduce your chance of injury by implementing a few basic training ideas. Here are four of our best tips on how to do just that while training for strength. 4 TIPS FOR INJURY PREVENTION IN STRENGTH TRAINING Don\u2019t be an idiot. \u25cf Always be sure to warm up properly, and keep your technique clean. \u25cf Avoid gym challenges and random heavy lifting. \u25cf Don\u2019t lift any loads you haven\u2019t worked up to in a calculated, progressive manner. This point is huge! Tons of people have gotten hurt by reaching way beyond the loads they should have been lifting when all they needed to do was wait another several weeks of progression. Page 46 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 44 14. Preventing and Managing Injuries Ramp up loads slowly. \u25cf As you add weight to the bar from week to week, never add so much weight that you have to increase more than one point on the RPE scale from the week prior. In most cases, you will be going up by 5, 10, or 15 pounds. Don\u2019t be silly and slap an extra 45 pounds on the bar because you \u201cfeel like it.\u201d Being patient will notably reduce your injury risk. \u25cf Don\u2019t train with overlapping soreness often as training with microdamage may predispose you to injury. If you train with overlapping soreness on occasion, don\u2019t add any more sets to the session you\u2019re doing or to the one before its next week\u2019s equivalent so that you\u2019re not doing more when you already can\u2019t recover from doing the current prescription. Pay attention. \u25cf If some technique hurts your joints more and more with each rep or set, pause the set, rack the weight, reevaluate, and make adjustments if it continues. Page 47 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 45 14. Preventing and Managing Injuries Deload maturely. \u25cf Don\u2019t skip the deload or cut it short! Deloads can be boring, but your body needs them to literally heal. Skipping or cutting a deload short is essentially asking for trouble. \u25cf Don\u2019t add work during your deload cause you\u2019re itching to train. Deloads are supposed to be easy and low-volume. If your deload isn\u2019t super easy, it\u2019s not"

    "text": "much of a deload. Instead, it\u2019s just another week of hard training where your fatigue doesn\u2019t really decline much in preparation for the next mesocycle. This will cause fatigue to accumulate much faster than anticipated in that next mesocycle, which will inevitably cause problems including (but not limited to) an increased risk of injury. Hopefully, you take all of this insight into account and never wind up getting hurt to the extent that your training quality and intensity is negatively impacted. But, because the nature of strength training is one of overload and pushing beyond your limits with increasingly heavy weights, injury for almost everyone at some point in the game is nearly inevitable. If and when you do get hurt, please give the following steps a look before you make your next move. As a bit of a bonus consideration, please remember that when you\u2019ve injured a specific muscle or joint but still want to train other muscles, you have to make sure none of the other training bothers the injured area to any noticeable extent. In doing this, you will avoid continuously reaggravating the injury without letting it heal completely. Page 48 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 46 14. Preventing and Managing Injuries 6 STEPS FOR INJURY MANAGEMENT IN STRENGTH TRAINING For the injured area itself: 1. See a medical professional and do all the surgery/rehab/time away they instruct. 2. When you\u2019re cleared for activity, start with sets of 20-30 reps at 5-10 RIR and work on range of motion. You can end this phase of training when you can per- form the entire range of motion of the movement/joint pain-free 3. Once the injured area is pain-free in normal ranges of motion, work up to doing 3-0 RIR in just a handful of sets of 20-30 reps in several sessions across the week. Recently injured tissues have very poor volume tolerance, so doing a bit fewer sets (like 1-2 per session 2-3x per week) is better than doing more sets (like 3-4 sets per session 3-4x per week). 4. After this, add sets and cycle from MEV to MRV in the 20-30 rep range. This can be done once you\u2019re very comfortably recovering from just a few sets of 20-30 reps. 5. Once you\u2019ve spent some time training comfortably and pain-free in the higher rep ranges, slowly add load to some of those sets to get into the 10-20 rep range. Add load slowly and let the reps fall by two or so per session. In other words, don\u2019t just jump from your 30RM to 10RM unless you want to get hurt again. 6. From here, keep slowly adding load, and eventually dip back into the 5-10 rep range. Once you\u2019ve been able to train in that range effectively for a few weeks, take a deload and then proceed into your strength and peaking rep ranges as you see fit.

Preventing and Managing Injuries INJURY OCCURS STEPS TO TAKE WHEN AN INJURY OCCURS SEEK MEDICAL HELP REHABILITATION SURGERY TIME AWAY CLEARED FOR ACTIVITY PAIN-FREE AND NORMAL ROM ADD SETS AND CYCLE FROM MEV TO MRV IN 20-30 REP RANGE SLOWLY ADD LOAD INTO THE 10-20 REP RANGE KEEP ADDING LOAD AND DIP INTO 5-10 REP RANGE DELOAD AND RESUME NORMAL TRAINING 3-0 RIR, 20-30 REP SETS WITHIN INJURED TISSUE This way, you\u2019re not just continuously re-aggravating the injury and not letting it heal completely. Page 50 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 48 15. MATCHING YOUR TRAINING TO YOUR DIET Diet is a big factor in how well your strength training improves your abilities, and making sure you\u2019re dieting the right way for the phase of strength training you\u2019re in can be a major contributor to your success. If you\u2019re trying to gain muscle by eating in a caloric surplus, only do this during a hyper- trophy block. Otherwise, you\u2019ll put on a needless amount of fat. If you\u2019re dieting to lose fat and potentially enter a lower weight class, you\u2019re best off doing this during your hypertrophy blocks as well. You can diet down during early strength phases in your strength blocks, but it\u2019s highly recommended that you never exceed a rate of loss of"

    "text": "greater than 0.5% body weight per week to minimize risking strength losses. If you diet down during such strength phases, make sure to also reduce your load pro- gressions from week to week by about half of their usual amounts so that you don\u2019t accumulate too much fatigue and overreach prematurely. Weight loss dieting makes fatigue reduction way harder, and you have to take this into account! Think of it as driving in the snow. You either slow down so that you don\u2019t swerve reck- lessly off the road, or you don\u2019t slow down and wind up in a ditch or worse. The trip goes slower when you take the necessary precautions to account for the snow, but it goes faster than any alternate situation in which you drive off the road and waste time being stuck in a snowbank waiting for help. Page 51 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 49 15. Matching Your Training to Your Diet Furthermore, if our analogous car flips and you get injured because you\u2019ve been carrying excessive levels of fatigue from dieting while pushing loads too quickly in a strength phase, then you\u2019ve got more problems than just a slightly delayed trip. In later phases in your strength block, you should be maintaining your weight, and you should nearly always maintain your weight during peaking phases to make sure you\u2019re used to lifting in a body that has the same leverages over time and isn\u2019t fatigued from weight loss dieting right at the point when fatigue reduction is most critically important. Yes, you can lose weight in the last days or hours of your meet prep by cutting water, but you should not be losing weight in the last weeks of meet prep by cutting calories. Page 52 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 50 16. TROUBLESHOOTING LACK OF PROGRESS There could be many reasons you\u2019re not seeing the strength gains you want or the gains you\u2019re used to seeing. The most common reason is that you\u2019re still expecting linear gains like you made when you were a beginner. But, because you\u2019re more advanced, you should actually be expect- ing gains of diminishing returns. The second biggest reason you might not be getting the gains you want is simply genet- ics. Not all of us were built to bench press 500 pounds, which is certainly unfortunate, but it isn\u2019t exactly a Shakespearean tragedy. That being said, if you\u2019ve made peace with your training age and your genetics, there may be some additional factors to consider that could improve your rate of strength gains, especially if you\u2019ve hit an unexplained plateau. 8 FACTORS FOR TROUBLESHOOTING A LACK OF STRENGTH IMPROVEMENT 1. Appropriate and consistent training and diet If you\u2019re inconsistent, the inconsistency is the problem with your gains. You will only see your best gains when you\u2019re able to piece together tidy sequences of completed workouts over weeks and months. Page 53 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 51 16. Troubleshooting Lack of Progress 2. MEV to MRV training for each muscle group targeted For example, do you even know if you\u2019re hitting your MRV at the end of your squat accumulation phases? If you\u2019ve never taken your squat training volume high enough to stall squat strength out, you don\u2019t actually know. They might benefit from much more volume than you\u2019re currently training them with, and no amount of extra intensity will make up for that. You can do squat 1RMs until you\u2019re blue in the face, but what you probably need is just more sets of 3-6 reps. Are these sets of 3-6 as exciting? Maybe not. But they are very effective in the long-term. If you feel as though you might be undertraining a lift, increase the number of sets every mesocycle of a block and pay attention to where your strength gains are best. Please remember that you find out the strength gains in the tested mesocycle by seeing how strong you are for reps in the mesocycle after it, not in the mesocycle itself. Only after a deload brings the fatigue down can you see if your experiment worked. On the other hand, you might be smashing your bench press with near-MRV or even above"

    "text": "MRV volumes. In this case, you can reduce the amount of training you do for your pressing movements by one set per mesocycle in a given block and see at which volumes your rep strength goes up the most. You can use this process for any movement type, but you have to make sure that each movement type is completely accounted for. If you lower your bench pressing volume but raise your machine pressing volume at the same time, you\u2019re not actually lowering your total pressing volumes. 3. Getting fatigue management in line If you\u2019re not sleeping enough to be well-rested (7-9 hours), if high levels of stress are killing your energy levels, and if you don\u2019t have regular times during most days and pretty much all weeks to unwind, you may not be gaining at your best rates. Rest and recovery are incredibly important when it comes to making your best strength gains. Page 54 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 52 16. Troubleshooting Lack of Progress 4. Making sure your chosen exercises have high SFRs and high RSMs Don\u2019t be the athlete who simply goes through the motions. If an exercise has a low SFR for you, try another one. Use movements that give you the best SFRs and the highest RSMs for really lagging muscle groups and movement types so that you know you\u2019re using the best weapons for the battle. It would be strange to complain about lagging squat strength if you have yet to try increasing your hack squats for sets of 5-10 reps in your hypertrophy phase even though you get a Grady stimulus from hack squats. 5. Finding a stable technique for each lift that works best for your biggest numbers Some people prefer to bench press with a wider grip while others prefer to bench press with a narrower grip. Similarly, some people prefer sumo deadlifting, some conventional, and many others prefer various styles that seem to account for everything in between. Your technique doesn\u2019t have to look like someone else\u2019s, but it should feel best for you. As you practice it over time, you should become very comfortable with it, which is likely to lead to your best gains. Think of it this way. If you haven\u2019t been progressing on a lift, what do you have to lose by experimenting with a slightly different technique? Strength regain is very easy compared to new gain, so at worst you\u2019ll just be in the same spot after your experiment. At best, you\u2019ll see improvements! 6. Being hypercaloric in gain phases and adding net bodyweight over months/ years To become the strongest version of yourself, you have to get more muscular. If you look at almost all of the champion lifters in most weight classes over history, they are mega-jacked! No, you might not have signed up explicitly for hypertrophy work when you chose to pursue strength training, but it\u2019s undeniable that big muscles create big forces. So, if you want to get stronger, the most straightfor- ward way to do it by far is to add muscle size. Page 55 STRENGTH TRAINING MADE SIMPLE 53 16. Troubleshooting Lack of Progress Unless you\u2019re already very lean for your weight class and you don\u2019t want to move up, adding size is a very good idea in nearly every case for serious strength athletes. 7. Attending to training-side fatigue management Training manipulations that reduce cumulative fatigue such as deloads, active rests, and low-volume phases are critical in programming, especially when you\u2019re no longer a beginner. A very common \u201cinstant PR\u201d formula is to take a late beginner or early intermedi- ate and have them do a deload or active rest for the first time. In most cases, a few weeks later you\u2019ll notice that they are making crazy strength gains. Weird, right? It\u2019s almost as if bringing down fatigue is a good thing that potentiates further strength gains! 8. Making all the above changes for long enough It\u2019s easy to say you tried the changes but they didn\u2019t work if you only tried to implement them for a few days or even a few weeks. But, if you really want the best results, try implementing some of these trouble- shooting"

Page 22 How to Use This Book Does history record any case in which the majority was right? \u2014Robert Heinlein I love fools\u2019 experiments. I\u2019m always making them. \u2014Charles Darwin MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA, 10 P.M., FRIDAY S horeline Amphitheater was rocking. More than 20,000 people had turned out at northern California\u2019s largest music venue to hear Nine Inch Nails, loud and in charge, on what was expected to be their last tour. Backstage, there was more unusual entertainment. \u201cDude, I go into the stall to take care of business, and I look over and see the top of Tim\u2019s head popping above the divider. He was doing f*cking air squats in the men\u2019s room in complete silence.\u201d Glenn, a videographer and friend, burst out laughing as he reenacted my technique. To be honest, he needed to get his thighs closer to parallel. \u201cForty air squats, to be exact,\u201d I offered. Kevin Rose, founder of Digg, one of the top-500 most popular websites in the world, joined in the laughter and raised a beer to toast the incident. I, on the other hand, was eager to move on to the main event. In the next 45 minutes, I consumed almost two full-size barbecue chicken pizzas and three handfuls of mixed nuts, for a cumulative total of about 4,400 calories. It was my fourth meal of the day, breakfast having consisted of two glasses of grapefruit juice, a large cup of coffee with cinnamon, two chocolate croissants, and two bear claws. The more interesting portion of the story started well after Trent Reznor left the stage. Roughly 72 hours later, I tested my bodyfat percentage with an ultrasound analyzer designed by a physicist out of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Charting the progress on my latest experiment, I\u2019d dropped from 11.9% to 10.2% bodyfat, a 14% reduction of the total fat on my body, in 14 days. How? Timed doses of garlic, sugar cane, and tea extracts, among other things. Page 23 The process wasn\u2019t punishing. It wasn\u2019t hard. Tiny changes were all it took."

    "text": "Tiny changes that, while small in isolation, produced enormous changes when used in combination. Want to extend the fat-burning half-life of caffeine? Naringenin, a useful little molecule in grapefruit juice, does just the trick. Need to increase insulin sensitivity before bingeing once per week? Just add some cinnamon to your pastries on Saturday morning, and you can get the job done. Want to blunt your blood glucose for 60 minutes while you eat a high-carb meal guilt-free? There are a half-dozen options. But 2% bodyfat in two weeks? How can that be possible if many general practitioners claim that it\u2019s impossible to lose more than two pounds of fat per week? Here\u2019s the sad truth: most of the one-size-fits-all rules, this being one example, haven\u2019t been field-tested for exceptions. You can\u2019t change your muscle fiber type? Sure you can. Genetics be damned. Calories in and calories out? It\u2019s incomplete at best. I\u2019ve lost fat while grossly overfeeding. Cheesecake be praised. The list goes on and on. It\u2019s obvious that the rules require some rewriting. That\u2019s what this book is for. Diary of a Madman The spring of 2007 was an exciting time for me. My first book, after being turned down by 26 out of 27 publishers, had just hit the New York Times bestseller list and seemed headed for #1 on the business list, where it landed several months later. No one was more dumbfounded than me. One particularly beautiful morning in San Jose, I had my first major media phone interview with Clive Thompson of Wired magazine. During our pre- interview small chat, I apologized if I sounded buzzed. I was. I had just finished a 10-minute workout following a double espresso on an empty stomach. It was a new experiment that would take me to single-digit bodyfat with two such sessions per week. Clive wanted to talk to me about e-mail and websites like Twitter. Before we got started, and as a segue from the workout comment, I joked that the major Page 24 fears of modern man could be boiled down to two things: too much e-mail and getting fat. Clive laughed and agreed. Then we moved on. The interview went well, but it was this offhand joke that stuck with me. I retold it to dozens of people over the subsequent month, and the response was always the same: agreement and nodding. This book, it seemed, had to be written. The wider world thinks I\u2019m obsessed with time management, but they haven\u2019t seen the other\u2014much more legitimate, much more ridiculous\u2014obsession. I\u2019ve recorded almost every workout I\u2019ve done since age 18. I\u2019ve had more than 1,000 blood tests 1 performed since 2004, sometimes as often as every two weeks, tracking everything from complete lipid panels, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c, to IGF-1 and free testosterone. I\u2019ve had stem cell growth factors imported from Israel to reverse \u201cpermanent\u201d injuries, and I\u2019ve flown to rural tea farmers in China to discuss Pu-Erh tea\u2019s effects on fat-loss. All said and done, I\u2019ve spent more than $250,000 on testing and tweaking over the last decade. Just as some people have avant-garde furniture or artwork to decorate their homes, I have pulse oximeters, ultrasound machines, and medical devices for measuring everything from galvanic skin response to REM sleep. The kitchen and bathroom look like an ER. If you think that\u2019s craziness, you\u2019re right. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need to be a guinea pig to benefit from one. Hundreds of men and women have tested the techniques in The 4-Hour Body (4HB) over the last two years, and I\u2019ve tracked and graphed hundreds of their results (194 people in this book). Many have lost more than 20 pounds of fat in the first month of experimentation, and for the vast majority, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever been able to do so. Why do 4HB approaches work where others fail? Because the changes are either small or simple, and often both. There is zero room for misunderstanding, and visible results compel you to continue. If results are fast and measurable, 2 self-discipline isn\u2019t needed. I can"

Page 25 We won\u2019t be covering any of this. Not because it doesn\u2019t work\u2014it does \u2026 up to a point. But it\u2019s not the type of advice that will make friends greet you with \u201cWhat the #$%& have you been doing?!\u201d, whether in the dressing room or on the playing field. That requires an altogether different approach. The Unintentional Dark Horse Let\u2019s be clear: I\u2019m neither a doctor nor a PhD. I am a meticulous data cruncher with access to many of the world\u2019s best athletes and scientists. This puts me in a rather unusual position. I\u2019m able to pull from disciplines and subcultures that rarely touch one another, and I\u2019m able to test hypotheses using the kind of self-experimentation mainstream practitioners can\u2019t condone (though their help behind the scenes is critical). By challenging basic assumptions, it\u2019s possible to stumble upon simple and unusual solutions to long-standing problems. Overfat? Try timed protein and pre-meal lemon juice. Undermuscled? Try ginger and sauerkraut. Can\u2019t sleep? Try upping your saturated fat or using cold exposure. This book includes the findings of more than 100 PhDs, NASA scientists, medical doctors, Olympic athletes, professional sports trainers (from the NFL to MLB), world-record holders, Super Bowl rehabilitation specialists, and even former Eastern Bloc coaches. You\u2019ll meet some of the most incredible specimens, including before-and-after transformations, you\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t have a publish-or-perish academic career to preserve, and this is a good thing. As one MD from a well-known Ivy League university said to me over lunch: We\u2019re trained for 20 years to be risk-averse. I\u2019d like to do the experimentation, but I\u2019d risk everything I\u2019ve built over two decades of schooling and training by doing so. I\u2019d need an immunity necklace. The university would never tolerate it. He then added: \u201cYou can be the dark horse.\u201d It\u2019s a strange label, but he was right. Not just because I have no prestige to lose. I\u2019m also a former industry insider. Page 26 From 2001 to 2009, I was CEO of a sports nutrition company with distribution in more than a dozen countries, and while we followed the rules, it became clear that many others didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t the most profitable option. I have witnessed blatant lies on nutritional fact panels, marketing executives budgeting for FTC fines in anticipation of lawsuits, and much worse from some of the best-known brands in the business. 3 I understand how and where consumers are deceived. The darker tricks of the trade in supplements and sports nutrition\u2014clouding results of \u201cclinical trials\u201d and creative labeling as just two examples\u2014are nearly the same as in biotech and Big Pharma. I will teach you to spot bad science, and therefore bad advice and bad products. 4 Late one evening in the fall of 2009, I sat eating cassoulet and duck legs with Dr. Lee Wolfer in the clouds of fog known as San Francisco. The wine was flowing, and I told her of my fantasies to return to a Berkeley or Stanford and pursue a doctorate in the biological sciences. I was briefly a neuroscience major at Princeton University and dreamed of a PhD at the end of my name. Lee is regularly published in peer-reviewed journals and has been trained at some of the finest programs in the world, including the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) (MD), Berkeley (MS), Harvard Medical School (residency), the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (fellowship), and Spinal Diagnostics in Daly City, California (fellowship). She just smiled and raised a glass of wine before responding: \u201cYou\u2014Tim Ferriss\u2014can do more outside the system than inside it.\u201d A Laboratory of One Many of these theories have been killed off only when some decisive experiment exposed their incorrectness \u2026 thus the yeoman work in any science \u2026 is done by the experimentalist, who must keep the"

    "text": "theoreticians honest. \u2014Michio Kaku (Hyperspace), theoretical physicist and co-creator of string field theory Most breakthroughs in performance (and appearance) enhancement start with animals and go through the following adoption curve: Racehorses \u2192 AIDS patients (because of muscle wasting) and bodybuilders \u2192 elite athletes \u2192 rich people \u2192 the rest of us Page 27 The last jump from the rich to the general public can take 10\u201320 years, if it happens at all. It often doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m not suggesting that you start injecting yourself with odd substances never before tested on humans. I am suggesting, however, that government agencies (the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration) are at least 10 years behind current research, and at least 20 years behind compelling evidence in the field. More than a decade ago, a close friend named Paul was in a car accident and suffered brain damage that lowered his testosterone production. Even with supplemental testosterone treatments (creams, gels, short-acting injectables) and after visiting scores of top endocrinologists, he still suffered from the symptoms of low testosterone. Everything changed\u2014literally overnight\u2014once he switched to testosterone enanthate, a variation seldom seen in the medical profession in the United States. Who made the suggestion? An advanced bodybuilder who knew his biochemistry. It shouldn\u2019t have made a difference, yet it did. Do doctors normally take advantage of the 50+ years of experience that professional bodybuilders have testing, even synthesizing, esters of testosterone? No. Most doctors view bodybuilders as cavalier amateurs, and bodybuilders view doctors as too risk-averse to do anything innovative. This separation of the expertise means both sides suffer suboptimal results. Handing your medical care over to the biggest man-gorilla in your gym is a bad idea, but it\u2019s important to look for discoveries outside of the usual suspects. Those closest to a problem are often the least capable of seeing it with fresh eyes. Despite the incredible progress in some areas of medicine in the last 100 years, a 60-year-old in 2009 can expect to live an average of only 6 years longer than a 60-year-old in 1900. Me? I plan on living to 120 while eating the best rib- eye cuts I can find. More on that later. Suffice to say: for uncommon solutions, you have to look in uncommon places. The Future\u2019s Already Here In our current world, even if proper trials are funded for obesity studies as just one example, it might take 10\u201320 years for the results. Are you prepared to wait? Page 28 I hope not. \u201cKaiser can\u2019t talk to UCSF, who can\u2019t talk to Blue Shield. You are the arbiter of your health information.\u201d Those are the words of a leading surgeon at UCSF, who encouraged me to take my papers with me before hospital records claimed them as their property. Now the good news: with a little help, it\u2019s never been easier to collect a few data points (at little cost), track them (without training), and make small changes that produce incredible results. Type 2 diabetics going off of medication 48 hours after starting a dietary intervention? Wheelchair-bound seniors walking again after 14 weeks of training? This is not science fiction. It\u2019s being done today. As William Gibson, who coined the term \u201ccyberspace,\u201d has said: \u201cThe future is already here\u2014it is just unevenly distributed.\u201d The 80/20 Principle: From Wall Street to the Human Machine This book is designed to give you the most important 2.5% of the tools you need for body recomposition and increased performance. Some short history can explain this odd 2.5%. Vilfredo Pareto was a controversial economist-cum-sociologist who lived from 1848 to 1923. His seminal work, Cours d\u2019\u00e9conomie politique , included a then little explored \u201claw\u201d of income distribution that would later bear his name: \u201cPareto\u2019s Law,\u201d or \u201cthe Pareto Distribution.\u201d It is more popularly known as \u201cthe 80/20 Principle.\u201d Pareto demonstrated a grossly uneven but"

    "text": "predictable distribution of wealth in society\u201480 percent of the wealth and income is produced and possessed by 20 percent of the population. He also showed that this 80/20 principle could be found almost everywhere, not just in economics. Eighty percent of Pareto\u2019s garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example. In practice, the 80/20 principle is often much more disproportionate. To be perceived as fluent in conversational Spanish, for example, you need an active vocabulary of approximately 2,500 high-frequency words. This will allow you to comprehend more than 95% of all conversation. To get to 98% comprehension would require at least five years of practice instead of five months. Doing the math, 2,500 words is a mere 2.5% of the estimated 100,000 Page 29 words in the Spanish language. This means: 1. 2.5% of the total subject matter provides 95% of the desired results. 2. This same 2.5% provides just 3% less benefit than putting in 12 times as much effort. This incredibly valuable 2.5% is the key, the Archimedes lever, for those who want the best results in the least time. The trick is finding that 2.5%. 5 This book is not intended as a comprehensive treatise on all things related to the human body. My goal is to share what I have found to be the 2.5% that delivers 95% of the results in rapid body redesign and performance enhancement. If you are already at 5% bodyfat or bench-pressing 400 pounds, you are in the top 1% of humans and now in the world of incremental gains. This book is for the other 99% who can experience near-unbelievable gains in short periods of time. Page 30 How to Use This Book\u2014Five Rules It is important that you follow five rules with this book. Ignore them at your peril. RULE #1. THINK OF THIS BOOK AS A BUFFET. Do not read this book from start to finish. Most people won\u2019t need more than 150 pages to reinvent themselves. Browse the table of contents, pick the chapters that are most relevant, and discard the rest \u2026 for now. Pick one appearance goal and one performance goal to start. The only mandatory sections are \u201cFundamentals\u201d and \u201cGround Zero.\u201d Here are some popular goals, along with the corresponding chapters to read in the order listed: RAPID FAT-LOSS All chapters in \u201cFundamentals\u201d All chapters in \u201cGround Zero\u201d \u201cThe Slow-Carb Diet I and II\u201d \u201cBuilding the Perfect Posterior\u201d Total page count: 98 RAPID MUSCLE GAIN All chapters in \u201cFundamentals\u201d All chapters in \u201cGround Zero\u201d \u201cFrom Geek to Freak\u201d \u201cOccam\u2019s Protocol I and II\u201d Total page count: 97 RAPID STRENGTH GAIN All chapters in \u201cFundamentals\u201d All chapters in \u201cGround Zero\u201d \u201cEffortless Superhuman\u201d (pure strength, little mass gain) \u201cPre-Hab: Injury-Proofing the Body\u201d Total page count: 92 RAPID SENSE OF TOTAL WELL-BEING Page 31 All chapters in \u201cFundamentals\u201d All chapters in \u201cGround Zero\u201d All chapters in \u201cImproving Sex\u201d All chapters in \u201cPerfecting Sleep\u201d \u201cReversing \u2018Permanent\u2019 Injuries\u201d Total page count: 143 Once you\u2019ve selected the bare minimum to get started, get started. Then, once you\u2019ve committed to a plan of action, dip back into the book at your leisure and explore. Immediately practical advice is contained in every chapter, so don\u2019t discount something based on the title. Even if you are a meat- eater (as I am), for example, you will benefit from \u201cThe Meatless Machine.\u201d Just don\u2019t read it all at once. RULE #2. SKIP THE SCIENCE IF IT\u2019S TOO DENSE. You do not need to be a scientist to read this book. For the geeks and the curious, however, I\u2019ve included a lot of cool details. These details can often enhance your results but are not required reading. Such sections are boxed and labeled \u201cGeek\u2019s Advantage\u201d with a \u201cGA\u201d symbol. Even if you\u2019ve been intimidated by science in the past, I encourage you to browse some of these GA sections\u2014at least a few will offer some fun \u201choly sh*t!\u201d moments and improve results 10% or so. If you ever feel overwhelmed, though, skip them, as they\u2019re not mandatory for the results you\u2019re after. RULE #3."

    "text": "PLEASE BE SKEPTICAL. Don\u2019t assume something is true because I say it is. As the legendary Timothy Noakes PhD, author or co-author of more than 400 published research papers, is fond of saying: \u201cFifty percent of what we know is wrong. The problem is that we do not know which 50% it is.\u201d Everything in this book works, but I have surely gotten some of the mechanisms completely wrong. In other words, I believe the how-to is 100% reliable, but some of the why-to will end up on the chopping block as we learn more. RULE #4. DON\u2019T USE SKEPTICISM AS AN EXCUSE FOR INACTION. As the good Dr. Noakes also said to me about one Olympic training regimen: \u201cThis [approach] could be totally wrong, but it\u2019s a hypothesis worth disproving.\u201d Page 32 It\u2019s important to look for hypotheses worth disproving. Science starts with educated (read: wild-ass) guesses. Then it\u2019s all trial and error. Sometimes you predict correctly from the outset. More often, you make mistakes and stumble across unexpected findings, which lead to new questions. If you want to sit on the sidelines and play full-time skeptic, suspending action until a scientific consensus is reached, that\u2019s your choice. Just realize that science is, alas, often as political as a dinner party with die- hard Democrats and Republicans. Consensus comes late at best. Don\u2019t use skepticism as a thinly veiled excuse for inaction or remaining in your comfort zone. Be skeptical, but for the right reason: because you\u2019re looking for the most promising option to test in real life. Be proactively skeptical, not defensively skeptical. Let me know if you make a cool discovery or prove me wrong. This book will evolve through your feedback and help. RULE #5. ENJOY IT. I\u2019ve included a lot of odd experiences and screwups just for simple entertainment value. All fact and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Much of the content is intended to be read as the diary of a madman. Enjoy it. More than anything, I\u2019d like to impart the joy of exploration and discovery. Remember: this isn\u2019t a homework assignment. Take it at your own pace. The Billionaire Productivity Secret and the Experimental Lifestyle \u201cHow do you become more productive?\u201d Richard Branson leaned back and thought for a second. The tropical sounds of his private oasis, Necker Island, murmured in the background. Twenty people sat around him at rapt attention, wondering what a billionaire\u2019s answer would be to one of the big questions\u2014perhaps the biggest question\u2014of business. The group had been assembled by marketing impresario Joe Polish to brainstorm growth options for Richard\u2019s philanthropic Virgin Unite. It was one of his many new ambitious projects. Virgin Group already had more than 300 companies, more than 50,000 employees, and $25 billion per year in revenue. In other words, Branson had personally built an empire larger than the GDP of some developing countries. Then he broke the silence: Page 33 \u201cWork out.\u201d He was serious and elaborated: working out gave him at least four additional hours of productive time every day. The cool breeze punctuated his answer like an exclamation point. 4HB is intended to be much more than a book. I view 4HB as a manifesto, a call to arms for a new mental model of living: the experimental lifestyle. It\u2019s up to you\u2014not your doctor, not the newspaper\u2014 to learn what you best respond to. The benefits go far beyond the physical. If you understand politics well enough to vote for a president, or if you have ever filed taxes, you can learn the few most important scientific rules for redesigning your body. These rules will become your friends, 100% reliable and trusted. This changes everything. It is my sincere hope, if you\u2019ve suffered from dissatisfaction with your body, or confusion regarding diet and exercise, that your life will be divided into before-4HB and after-4HB. It can help you do what most people would consider superhuman, whether losing 100 pounds of fat or holding your breath for five minutes. It all works. There is no high"

Page 36 FUNDAMENTALS\u2014 FIRST AND FOREMOST Page 37 THE MINIMUM EFFECTIVE DOSE From Microwaves to Fat-Loss Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. \u2014Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry A rthur Jones was a precocious young child and particularly fond of crocodiles. He read his father\u2019s entire medical library before he was 12. The home environment might have had something to do with it, seeing as his parents, grandfather, great-grandfather, half-brother, and half-sister were all doctors. From humble beginnings in Oklahoma, he would mature into one of the most influential figures in the exercise science world. He would also become, in the words of more than a few, a particularly \u201cangry genius.\u201d One of Jones\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Ellington Darden PhD, shares a prototypical Jones anecdote: In 1970, Arthur invited Arnold [Schwarzenegger] and Franco Colombu to visit him in Lake Helen, Florida, right after the 1970 Mr. Olympia. Arthur picked them up at the airport in his Cadillac, with Arnold in the passenger seat and Franco in the back. There are probably 12 stoplights in between the airport and the Interstate, so it was a lot of stop-and-go driving. Now, you have to know that Arthur was a man who talked loud and dominated every conversation. But he couldn\u2019t get Arnold to shut up. He was just blabbing in his German or whatever and Arthur was having a hard time understanding what he was saying. So Arthur was getting annoyed and told him to quiet down, but Arnold just kept talking and talking. By the time they got onto the Interstate, Arthur had had enough. So he pulled over to the side of the road, got out, walked around, opened Arnold\u2019s door, grabbed him by the shirt collar, yanked him out, and said something to the effect of, \u201cListen here, you son of a bitch. If you don\u2019t shut the hell up, a man twice your age is going to whip your ass right out here in front of I-4 traffic. Just dare me.\u201d Within five seconds Arnold had apologized, got back in the car, and was a perfect gentlemen for the next three or four"

    "text": "days. Jones was more frequently pissed off than anything else. He was infuriated by what he considered stupidity in every corner of the Page 38 exercise science world, and he channeled this anger into defying the odds. This included putting 63.21 pounds on champion bodybuilder Casey Viator in 28 days and putting himself on the Forbes 400 list by founding and selling exercise equipment manufacturer Nautilus, which was estimated to have grossed $300 million per year at its zenith. He had no patience for fuzzy thinking in fields that depended on scientific clarity. In response to researchers who drew conclusions about muscular function using electromyography (EMG), Arthur attached their machines to a cadaver and moved its limbs to record similar \u201cactivity.\u201d Internal friction, that is. Jones lamented his fleeting time: \u201cMy age being what it is, universal acceptance of what we are now doing may not come within my lifetime; but it will come, because what we are doing is clearly established by simple laws of basic physics that cannot be denied forever.\u201d He passed away on August 28, 2007, of natural causes, 80 years old and as ornery as ever. Jones left a number of important legacies, one of which will be the cornerstone of everything we\u2019ll discuss: the minimum effective dose. The Minimum Effective Dose The minimum effective dose (MED) is defined simply: the smallest dose that will produce a desired outcome. Jones referred to this critical point as the \u201cminimum effective load,\u201d as he was concerned exclusively with weight-bearing exercise, but we will look at precise \u201cdosing\u201d of both exercise and anything you ingest. 1 Anything beyond the MED is wasteful. To boil water, the MED is 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C) at standard air pressure. Boiled is boiled. Higher temperatures will not make it \u201cmore boiled.\u201d Higher temperatures just consume more resources that could be used for something else more productive. If you need 15 minutes in the sun to trigger a melanin response, 15 minutes is your MED for tanning. More than 15 minutes is redundant and will just result in burning and a forced break from the beach. During this forced break from the beach, let\u2019s assume one week, someone else who heeded his natural 15-minute MED will be able to fit in four more tanning sessions. He is four shades darker, whereas you have returned to your pale pre-beach self. Sad little manatee. In biological systems, exceeding your MED can freeze progress for weeks, even Page 39 months. In the context of body redesign, there are two fundamental MEDs to keep in mind: To remove stored fat \u2192 do the least necessary to trigger a fat-loss cascade of specific hormones. To add muscle in small or large quantities \u2192 do the least necessary to trigger local (specific muscles) and systemic (hormonal 2 ) growth mechanisms. Knocking over the dominos that trigger both of these events takes surprisingly little. Don\u2019t complicate them. For a given muscle group like the shoulders, activating the local growth mechanism might require just 80 seconds of tension using 50 pounds once every seven days, for example. That stimulus, just like the 212\u00b0F for boiling water, is enough to trigger certain prostaglandins, transcription factors, and all manner of complicated biological reactions. What are \u201ctranscription factors\u201d? You don\u2019t need to know. In fact, you don\u2019t need to understand any of the biology, just as you don\u2019t need to understand radiation to use a microwave oven. Press a few buttons in the right order and you\u2019re done. In our context: 80 seconds as a target is all you need to understand. That is the button. If, instead of 80 seconds, you mimic a glossy magazine routine\u2014say, an arbitrary 5 sets of 10 repetitions\u2014it is the muscular equivalent of sitting in the sun for an hour with a 15-minute MED. Not only is this wasteful, it is a predictable path for preventing and reversing gains. The organs and glands that help repair damaged tissue have more limitations than your enthusiasm. The kidneys, as one"

If you do a marathon three-hour workout and make your bloodstream look like an LA traffic jam, you stand the real chance of hitting a biochemical bottleneck. Again: the good news is that you don\u2019t need to know anything about your kidneys to use this information. All you need to know is: 80 seconds is the dose prescription. More is not better. Indeed, your greatest challenge will be resisting the temptation to do more. Page 40 The MED not only delivers the most dramatic results, but it does so in the least time possible.

Gaining 34 lb in 28 days requires a caloric surplus of 4300 calories per day, so for a guy his size, he must have eaten 7000 calories a day. He expects me to believe that he dropped 4% in bodyfat as a result of eating 7000 calories? \u2026\u201d I took a big swig of Malbec and read the blog comment again. Ah, the Internet. How far we haven\u2019t come. It was amusing, and one of hundreds of similar comments on this particular blog post, but the fact remained: I had gained 34 pounds of muscle, lost 4 pounds of fat, and decreased my total cholesterol from 222 to 147, all in 28 days, without anabolics or statins like Lipitor. The entire experiment had been recorded by Dr. Peggy Plato, director of the Sport and Fitness Evaluation Program at San Jose State University, who used hydrostatic weighing tanks, medical scales, and a tape measure to track everything from waist circumference to bodyfat percentage. My total time in the gym over four weeks? Four hours. 3 Eight 30-minute workouts. The data didn\u2019t lie. But isn\u2019t weight loss or gain as simple as calories in and calories out? It\u2019s attractive in its simplicity, yes, but so is cold fusion. It doesn\u2019t work quite as advertised. German poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe had the right perspective: \u201cMysteries are not necessarily miracles.\u201d To do the impossible (sail around the world, break the four-minute mile, reach the moon), you need to ignore the popular. Charles Munger, right-hand adviser to Warren Buffett, the richest man on the planet, is known for his unparalleled clear thinking and near-failure-proof track record. How did he refine his thinking to help build a $3 trillion business in Berkshire Hathaway? Page 42 The answer is \u201cmental models,\u201d or analytical rules-of-thumb 4 pulled from disciplines outside of investing, ranging from physics to evolutionary biology. Eighty to 90 models have helped Charles Munger develop, in Warren Buffett\u2019s words, \u201cthe best 30-second mind in the world. He goes from A to Z in one move. He sees the essence of everything before you even finish the sentence.\u201d Charles Munger likes to quote Charles Darwin: Even people who aren\u2019t geniuses can outthink the rest of mankind if they develop certain thinking habits. In the 4HB, the following mental models, pulled from a variety of disciplines, are what will separate your results from the rest of mankind. New Rules for Rapid Redesign NO EXERCISE BURNS MANY CALORIES. Did you eat half an Oreo cookie? No problem. If you\u2019re a 220-pound male, you just need to climb 27 flights of stairs to burn it off.

    "text": "Put another way, moving 100 kilograms (220 pounds) 100 meters (about 27 flights of stairs) requires 100 kilojoules of energy, or 23.9 calories (known to scientists as kilocalories [kcal]). A pound of fat contains 4,082 calories. How many calories might running a marathon burn? 2,600 or so. The caloric argument for exercise gets even more depressing. Remember those 107 calories you burned during that kick-ass hour-long Stairmaster\u2122 session? Don\u2019t forget to subtract your basal metabolic rate (BMR), what you would have burned had you been sitting on the couch watching The Simpsons instead. For most people, that\u2019s about 100 calories per hour given off as heat (BTU). That hour on the Stairmaster was worth seven calories. As luck would have it, three small stalks of celery are six calories, so you have one calorie left to spare. But wait a minute: how many calories did that Page 43 sports drink and big post-workout meal have? Don\u2019t forget that you have to burn more calories than you later ingest in larger meals due to increased appetite. F*cking hell, right? It\u2019s enough to make a lumberjack cry. Confused and angry? You should be. As usual, the focus is on the least important piece of the puzzle. But why do scientists harp on the calorie? Simple. It\u2019s cheap to estimate, and it is a popular variable for publication in journals. This, dear friends, is referred to as \u201cparking lot\u201d science, so-called after a joke about a poor drunk man who loses his keys during a night on the town. His friends find him on his hands and knees looking for his keys under a streetlight, even though he knows he lost them somewhere else. \u201cWhy are you looking for your keys under the streetlight?\u201d they ask. He responds confidently, \u201cBecause there\u2019s more light over here. I can see better.\u201d For the researcher seeking tenure, grant money, or lucrative corporate consulting contracts, the maxim \u201cpublish or perish\u201d applies. If you need to include 100 or 1,000 test subjects and can only afford to measure a few simple things, you need to paint those measurements as tremendously important. Alas, mentally on your hands and knees is no way to spend life, nor is chafing your ass on a stationary bike. Instead of focusing on calories-out as exercise-dependent, we will look at two underexploited paths: heat and hormones. So relax. You\u2019ll be able to eat as much as you want, and then some. New exhaust pipes will solve the problem. A DRUG IS A DRUG IS A DRUG Calling something a \u201cdrug,\u201d a \u201cdietary supplement,\u201d \u201cover-the-counter,\u201d or a \u201cnutriceutical\u201d is a legal distinction, not a biochemical one. None of these labels mean that something is safe or effective. Legal herbs can kill you just as dead as illegal narcotics. Supplements, often unpatentable molecules and therefore unappealing for drug development, can decrease cholesterol from 222 to 147 in four weeks, as I have done, or they can be inert and do absolutely nothing. Think \u201call-natural\u201d is safer than synthetic? Split peas are all-natural, but so is arsenic. Human growth hormone (HGH) can be extracted from the brains of all- Page 44 natural cadavers, but unfortunately it often brings Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with it, which is why HGH is now manufactured using recombinant DNA. Besides whole foods (which we\u2019ll treat separately as \u201cfood\u201d), anything you put in your mouth or your bloodstream that has an effect\u2014whether it\u2019s a cream, injection, pill, or powder\u2014is a drug . Treat them all as such. Don\u2019t distract yourself with labels that are meaningless to us. THE 20-POUND RECOMP GOAL For the vast majority of you reading this book who weigh more than 120 pounds, 20 pounds of recomposition (which I\u2019ll define below) will make you look and feel like a new person, so I suggest this as a goal. If you weigh less than 120 pounds, aim for 10 pounds; otherwise, 20 pounds is your new, specific goal. Even if you have 100+ pounds to lose, start with 20. On a 1\u201310 attractiveness scale, 20 pounds appears to be the critical threshold for going"

    "text": "from a 6 to a 9 or 10, at least as tested with male perception of females. The term \u201crecomposition\u201d is important. It does not mean a 20-pound reduction in weight. It\u2019s a 20-pound change in appearance. A 20-pound \u201crecomp\u201d could entail losing 20 pounds of fat or gaining 20 pounds of muscle, but it most often involves losing 15 pounds of fat and gaining 5 pounds of muscle, or some blend in between. Designing the best physique includes both subtraction and addition. THE 100-UNIT SLIDER: DIET, DRUGS, AND EXERCISE How, then, do we get to 20 pounds? Imagine a ruler with 100 lines on it, representing 100 total units, and two sliders. This allows us to split the 100 units into three areas that total 100. These three areas represent diet, drugs, and exercise. An equal split would look like this: ________/________/________ (33% diet, 33% drugs, 33% exercise) It is possible to reach your 20-pound recomp goal with any combination of the three, but some combinations are better than others. One hundred percent drugs can get you there, for example, but it will produce the most long-term side effects. One hundred percent exercise can get you there, but if injuries or circumstances interfere, the return to baseline is fast. Page 45 /__________/ (100% drugs) = side effects //__________ (100% exercise) = easy to derail Here is the ratio of most of the fat-loss case studies in this book: ______/_/___ (60% diet, 10% drugs, 30% exercise) If you\u2019re unable to follow a prescribed diet, as is sometimes the case with travel or vegetarianism, you\u2019ll need to move the sliders to increase the % attention paid to exercise and drugs. For example: _/____/_____ (10% diet, 45% drugs, 45% exercise) The numbers need not be measured, but this concept is critical to keep in mind as the world interferes with plans. Learning diet and exercise principles is priority #1, as these are the bedrock elements. Relying too much on drugs makes your liver and kidneys unhappy. The percentages will also depend on your personal preferences and \u201cadherence,\u201d which we cover next. THE DUCT TAPE TEST: WILL IT STICK? Eating at least one head of lettuce per day works well for losing fat and controlling insulin levels. That is, if you\u2019re a critical intervention patient, such as a morbidly obese type 1 diabetic. The options for such people, as explained by their doctors, are (1) change your diet with this prescription, or (2) die. Not surprisingly, adherence is often incredible. For someone who would like to lose 20 pounds but is more interested in how their ass looks in a pair of jeans, the adherence will be abysmal. Chopping vegetables and cleaning the Cuisinart three times per day will lead to one place: abandonment of the method. Does that mean it won\u2019t work for some people? No. It just means that it will fail for most people. We want to avoid all methods with a high failure rate, even if you believe you are in the diligent minority. In the beginning, everyone who starts a program believes they\u2019re in this minority. Take adherence seriously: will you actually stick with this change until you hit your goal? Page 46 If not, find another method, even if it\u2019s less effective and less efficient. The decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit. DON\u2019T CONFUSE PHYSICAL RECREATION WITH EXERCISE Physical recreation can be many things: baseball, swimming, yoga, rock- climbing, tipping cows \u2026 the list is endless. Exercise, on the other hand, means performing an MED of precise movements that will produce a target change. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s next to impossible to draw cause-and-effect relationships with recreation. There are too many variables. Effective exercise is simple and trackable. Physical recreation is great. I love chasing dogs at the dog park as much as the next person. Exercise in our context, however, is the application of measurable stimuli to decrease fat, increase muscle, or increase performance. Recreation is for fun. Exercise is for producing changes. Don\u2019t confuse"

Want to look like a sprinter, ripped and muscular? Train like a sprinter. Want to look like a basketball player, 68? Train like a basketball player. Hold on now. That last one doesn\u2019t work. Nor does it work for the first two examples. It\u2019s flawed logic, once again appealing and tempting in its simplicity. Here are three simple questions we can ask to avoid similar mistakes: 1. Is it possible that the arrow of causality is reversed? Example: do people who are naturally ripped and muscular often choose to be sprinters? Yep. 2. Are we mixing up absence and presence? Example: if the claim is that a no- meat diet extends average lifespan 5\u201315%, is it possible that it is the presence of more vegetables, not the absence of meat, that extends lifespan? It most certainly is. 3. Is it possible that you tested a specific demographic and that other variables are responsible for the difference? Example: if the claim is that yoga improves cardiac health, and the experimental group comprises upper-class folk, is it possible that they are therefore more likely than a control group to eat better food? You bet your downward-dog-posing ass. The point isn\u2019t to speculate about hundreds of possible explanations. Page 47 The point is to be skeptical, especially of sensationalist headlines. Most \u201cnew studies\u201d in the media are observational studies that can, at best, establish correlation (A happens while B happens), but not causality (A causes B to happen). If I pick my nose when the Super Bowl cuts to a commercial, did I cause that? This isn\u2019t a haiku. It\u2019s a summary: correlation doesn\u2019t prove causation. Be skeptical when people tell you that A causes B. They\u2019re wrong much more than 50% of the time. USE THE YO-YO: EMBRACE CYCLING Yo-yo dieting gets a bad rap. Instead of beating yourself up, going to the shrink, or eating an entire cheesecake because you ruined your diet with one cookie, allow me to deliver a message: it\u2019s normal. Eating more, then less, then more, and so on in a continuous sine wave is an impulse we can leverage to reach goals faster. Trying to prevent it\u2014attempting to sustain a reduced-calorie diet, for example\u2014is when yo-yoing becomes pathological and uncontrollable. Scheduling overeating at specific times, on the other hand, fixes problems instead of creating them. The top bodybuilders in the world understand this and, even when in a pre- contest dieting phase, will cycle calories to prevent hormonal downregulation. 5 The daily average might be 4,000 calories per day, but it would be cycled as follows: Monday, 4,000; Tuesday, 4,500; Wednesday, 3,500, etc. Ed Coan, described as the Michael Jordan of powerlifting, set more than 70 world records in his sport. Among other things, he deadlifted an unbelievable 901 pounds at 220 pounds bodyweight, beating even super-heavyweights. His trainer at the time, Marty Gallagher, has stated matter-of-factly that \u201cmaintaining peak condition year-round is a ticket to the mental ward.\u201d You can have your cheesecake and eat it too, as long as you get the timing right. The best part is that these planned ups and downs accelerate, rather than reverse, progress. Forget balance and embrace cycling. It\u2019s a key ingredient in rapid body redesign. PREDISPOSITION VS. PREDESTINATION: DON\u2019T BLAME YOUR GENES The marathoners of Kenya are legendary. Kenyan men have won all but one of the last 12 Boston Marathons. In the Page 48 1988 Olympics, Kenyan men won gold in the 800-meter, 1,500-meter, and 5,000-meter races, as well as the 3,000-meter steeplechase. Factoring in their population of approximately 30 million, the statistical likelihood of this happening at an international competition with the scope of the Olympics is about one in 1.6 billion.

Why? Because, as it turns out, they often train using low mileage and high intensity. If you are overweight and your parents are overweight, the inclination is to blame genetics, but this is only one possible explanation. Did fatness genes get passed on, or was it overeating behavior? After all, fat people tend to have fat pets. Even if you are predisposed to being overweight, you\u2019re not predestined to be fat. Eric Lander, leader of the Human Genome Project, has emphasized repeatedly the folly of learned helplessness through genetic determinism: People will think that because genes play a role in something, they determine everything. We see, again and again, people saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all genetic. I can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d That\u2019s nonsense. To say that something has a genetic component does not make it unchangeable. Don\u2019t accept predisposition. You don\u2019t have to, and we can feed and train you toward a different physical future. 6 Nearly all of my personal experiments involve improving something that should be genetically fixed. It is possible to redirect your natural-born genetic profile. From now on, \u201cbad genetics\u201d can\u2019t be your go-to excuse. ELIMINATE PROPAGANDA AND NEBULOUS TERMS The word aerobics came about when the gym instructors got together and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to charge $10 an hour, we can\u2019t call it jumping up and down.\u201d \u2014Rita Rudner Page 49 One question you must learn to ask when faced with advice or sales pitches is: \u201cIf this [method/product/diet/etc.] didn\u2019t work as advertised, what might their other incentives be for selling it?\u201d Aerobics classes? The reason you\u2019re sold: aerobics is more effective than alternative X. The real reason it\u2019s promoted: there\u2019s no equipment investment and the gym can maximize students per square foot per class. Many \u201cnew and improved\u201d recommendations are based on calculating profit first and then working backward to justify the method. Marketer-speak and ambiguous words have no place in 4HB or your efforts. Both will surface in conversations with friends who, in their best effort to help, will do more harm than good. If unprepared, one such conversation can single- handedly derail an entire program. These are two categories of words that you should neither use nor listen to. The first, marketer-speak, includes all terms used to scare or sell that have no physiological basis: Toning Cellulite Firming Shaping Aerobics The word cellulite , for example, first appeared in the April 15, 1968, issue of Vogue magazine, and this invented disease soon had a believer base worldwide: Vogue began to focus on the body as much as on the clothes, in part because there was little they could dictate with the anarchic styles.\u2026 In a stunning move, an entire replacement culture was developed by naming a \u201cproblem\u201d where it had scarcely existed before, centering it on the women\u2019s natural state, and elevating it to the existential female dilemma\u2026 . The number of diet- related articles rose 70 percent from 1968 to 1972. Cellulite is fat. Nothing special, neither a disease nor a unique female problem without solutions. It can be removed. Less obvious, but often more damaging than marketer-speak, are scientific- sounding words that are so overused as to have no agreed-upon meaning: Health Page 50 Fitness Optimal To eliminate words you shouldn\u2019t use in body redesign, the question to ask is: can I measure it? \u201cI just want to be healthy\u201d is not actionable. \u201cI want to increase my HDL cholesterol and improve my time for a one-mile jog (or walk)\u201d is actionable. \u201cHealthy\u201d is subject to the fads and regime du jour. Useless. The word optimal is also bandied"

Triathlon training? Extending lifespan 40%? Increasing bone density 20%? Having sex three times a day? \u201cOptimal\u201d depends entirely on what your goal is, and that goal should be numerically precise. \u201cOptimal\u201d is usable, but only when the \u201cfor what\u201d is clear.

Too many calories are just too many calories. \u2014Fred Stare, founder and former chair of the Harvard University Nutrition Department The above statement is so ridiculous as to defy belief, but let\u2019s take a look at the issue through a more rational lens: hypothetical scenarios. Scenario #1: Two male identical twins eat the exact same meals for 30 days. The only difference: one of the subjects just finished a strong course of antibiotics and now lacks sufficient good bacteria for full digestion. Will the body composition outcomes be the same? Of course not. Rule #1: It\u2019s not what you put in your mouth that matters, it\u2019s what makes it to your bloodstream. If it passes through, it doesn\u2019t count. The creator of the \u201ccalorie\u201d as we know it, 19th-century chemist Wilbur Olin Atwater, did not have the technology that we have today. He incinerated foods. Incineration does not equal human digestion; eating a fireplace log will not store Page 51 the same number of calories as burning one will produce. Tummies have trouble with bark, as they do with many things. Scenario #2: Three females of the same race, age, and body composition each consume 2,000 calories daily for 30 days. Subject 1 consumes nothing but table sugar, subject 2 consumes nothing but lean chicken breast, and subject 3 consumes nothing but mayonnaise (2,000 calories is just 19.4 tablespoons, if you\u2019d care to indulge). Will the body composition outcomes be the same? Of course not. Rule #2: The hormonal responses to carbohydrates (CHO), protein, and fat are different. There is no shortage of clinical studies to prove that beef calories 7 do not equal bourbon calories. One such study, conducted by Kekwick and Pawan, compared three groups put on calorically equal (isocaloric) semistarvation diets of 90% fat, 90% protein, or 90% carbohydrate. Though ensuring compliance was a challenge, the outcomes were clearly not at all the same: 1,000 cals. at 90% fat = weight loss of 0.9 lbs. per day 1,000 cals. at 90% protein = weight loss of 0.6 lbs. per day 1,000 cals. at 90% carbohydrate = weight gain of 0.24 lbs. per day Different sources of calories = different results. Things that affect calorie allocation\u2014and that can be modified for fat-loss and muscle gain\u2014include digestion, the ratio of protein-to-carbohydrates-to-fat, and timing. We\u2019ll address all three. Page 52 Marilyn Monroe building her world-famous sex appeal. More than 50% of the examples in this book are of women. Marketers have conditioned women to believe that they need specific programs and diets \u201cfor women.\u201d This is an example of capitalism at its worst: creating false need and confusion. Does this mean I\u2019m going to recommend that a woman do exactly the same thing as a 250-pound meathead who wants 20-inch arms? Of course not. The two have different goals. But 99% of the time both genders want exactly the same thing: less fat and a bit more muscle in the right places. Guess what? In these 99 cases out of 100, men and women should therefore do exactly the same thing. On average, women have less than one-tenth (often less than one-fortieth) the testosterone of men. This biochemical recipe just doesn\u2019t support rapid muscular growth unless you\u2019re an outlier, so, for the duration of this book, please suspend any fear of \u201cgetting bulky.\u201d Even if you are a fast-responder, as you observe changes, you can omit pieces or reduce frequency."

TOOLS AND TRICKS Seeking Wisdom : From Darwin to Munger ( www.fourhourbody.com/wisdom ) This is one of the best books on mental models, how to use them, and how not to make a fool of yourself.

Munger\u2019s Worldly Wisdom ( www.fourhourbody.com/munger ) This transcribed speech, given by Charlie Munger at USC Business School, discusses the 80\u201390 important mental models that cover 90% of the decisions he makes.

For example, proper conversion of T4 thyroid hormone to the more thermogenically active T3. 6. Genes alone cannot account for the diversity of characteristics we see around us. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is now thought to be responsible for much of the diversity, and there is good news: just as you can turn genes on and off, you can influence mRNA dramatically with environment\u2014even shut down certain processes entirely through interference. 7. Protein, for one, provokes a greater thermic effect of food (TEF) than either carbohydrate or fat\u2014in simple terms, in digestion a higher percentage of protein calories are \u201clost\u201d as heat vs. carbohydrates or fat. This has led some scientists to suggest that the 4 calories per gram assumed for protein should be downgraded 20% to 3.2 calories per gram.

    "text": "nice-to-have , not a must-have . There has been no \u201cHarajuku Moment.\u201d 2. There are no reminders. No consistent tracking = no awareness = no behavioral change. Consistent tracking, even if you have no knowledge of fat- loss or exercise, will often beat advice from world-class trainers. But what is this all-important \u201cHarajuku Moment\u201d? It\u2019s an epiphany that turns a nice-to-have into a must-have. There is no point in getting started until it happens. It applies to fat-loss as much as strength gain, to endurance as much as sex. No matter how many bullet points and recipes I provide, you will need a Harajuku Moment to fuel the change itself. Chad Fowler knows this. Chad, CTO of InfoEther, Inc., spends much of his time solving hard problems for customers in the Ruby computer language. He is also co-organizer of the annual RubyConf and RailsConf conferences, where I first met him. Our second meeting was in Boulder, Colorado, where he used his natural language Page 57 experience with Hindi to teach a knuckle-dragger (me) the primitive basics of Ruby. Chad is an incredible teacher, gifted with analogies, but I was distracted in our session by something he mentioned in passing. He\u2019d recently lost 70+ pounds in less than 12 months. It wasn\u2019t the amount of weight that I found fascinating. It was the timing. He\u2019d been obese for more than a decade, and the change seemed to come out of nowhere. Upon landing back in San Francisco, I sent him one question via e- mail: What were the tipping points, the moments and insights that led you to lose the 70 lbs.? I wanted to know what the defining moment was, the conversation or realization that made him pull the trigger after 10 years of business as usual. His answer is contained in this chapter. Even if you have no interest in fat-loss, the key insights (partial completeness, data, and oversimplification among them) will help you lift 500 pounds, run 50 kilometers, gain 50 pounds, or do anything else in this book. But let\u2019s talk about one oddity upfront: calorie counting. I just got done thrashing calorie counting, and I\u2019m including Chad\u2019s calorie-based approach to prove a point. This book didn\u2019t exist when Chad lost his weight, and there are far better things to track than calories. But \u2026 would I recommend tracking calories as an alternative to tracking nothing? You bet. Tracking anything is better than tracking nothing. If you are very overweight, very weak, very inflexible, or very anything negative, tracking even a mediocre variable will help you develop awareness that leads to the right behavioral changes. This underscores an encouraging lesson: you don\u2019t have to get it all right. You just have to be crystal clear on a few concepts. Results will follow. Enter Chad Fowler. The Harajuku Moment Page 58 \u201cWhy had I gone 10 years getting more and more out of shape (starting off pretty unhealthy in the first place) only to finally fix it now? \u201cI actually remember the exact moment I decided to do something. \u201cI was in Tokyo with a group of friends. We all went down to Harajuku to see if we could see some artistically dressed youngsters and also to shop for fabulous clothing, which the area is famous for. A couple of the people with us were pretty fashionable dressers and had some specific things in mind they wanted to buy. After walking into shops several times and leaving without seriously considering buying anything, one of my friends and I gave up and just waited outside while the others continued shopping. \u201cWe both lamented how unfashionable we were. \u201cI then found myself saying the following to him: \u2018For me, it doesn\u2019t even matter what I wear; I\u2019m not going to look good anyway.\u2019 \u201cI think he agreed with me. I can\u2019t remember, but that\u2019s not the point. The point was that, as I said those words, they hung in the air like when you say something super-embarrassing in a loud room but happen to catch the one randomly occurring slice of silence that happens all night long. Everyone looks at you like you\u2019re"

    "text": "an idiot. But this time, it was me looking at myself critically. I heard myself say those words and I recognized them not for their content, but for their tone of helplessness. I am, in most of my endeavors, a solidly successful person. I decide I want things to be a certain way, and I make it happen. I\u2019ve done it with my career, my learning of music, understanding of foreign languages, and basically everything I\u2019ve tried to do. \u201cFor a long time, I\u2019ve known that the key to getting started down the path of being remarkable in anything is to simply act with the intention of being remarkable. \u201cIf I want a better-than-average career, I can\u2019t simply \u2018go with the flow\u2019 and get it. Most people do just that: they wish for an outcome but make no intention- driven actions toward that outcome. If they would just do something most people would find that they get some version of the outcome they\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s been my secret. Stop wishing and start doing. \u201cYet here I was, talking about arguably the most important part of my life\u2014 my health\u2014as if it was something I had no control over. I had been going with the flow for years. Wishing for an outcome and waiting to see if it would come. I was the limp, powerless ego I detest in other people. \u201cBut somehow, as the school nerd who always got picked last for everything, I had allowed \u2018not being good at sports\u2019 or \u2018not being fit\u2019 to enter what I Page 59 considered to be inherent attributes of myself. The net result is that I was left with an understanding of myself as an incomplete person. And though I had (perhaps) overcompensated for that incompleteness by kicking ass in every other way I could, I was still carrying this powerlessness around with me and it was very slowly and subtly gnawing away at me from the inside. \u201cSo, while it\u2019s true that I wouldn\u2019t have looked great in the fancy clothes, the seemingly superficial catalyst that drove me to finally do something wasn\u2019t at all superficial. It actually pulled out a deep root that had been, I think, driving an important part of me for basically my entire life. \u201cAnd now I recognize that this is a pattern. In the culture I run in (computer programmers and tech people), this partial-completeness is not just common but maybe even the norm. My life lately has taken on a new focus: digging up those bad roots; the holes I don\u2019t notice in myself. And now I\u2019m filling them one at a time. \u201cOnce I started the weight loss, the entire process was not only easy but enjoyable. \u201cI started out easy. Just paying attention to food and doing relaxed cardio three to four times a week. This is when I started thinking in terms of making every day just slightly better than the day before. On day 1 it was easy. Any exercise was better than what I\u2019d been doing. \u201cIf you ask the average obese person: \u2018If you could work out for ONE year and be considered \u201cin shape,\u201d would you do it?\u2019 I\u2019d guess that just about every single one would emphatically say, \u2018Hell, yes!\u2019 The problem is that for most normal people, there is no clear path from fat to okay in a year. For almost everyone, the path is there and obvious if you know what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine an outcome like that so far in the distance. \u201cThe number-one realization that led me to be able to keep doing it and make the right decisions was to use data . \u201cI learned about the basal metabolic rate (BMR), also called resting metabolic rate, and was amazed at how many calories I would have to eat in order to stay the same weight. It was huge. As I started looking at calorie content for food that wasn\u2019t obviously bad, I felt like I\u2019d have to just gluttonously eat all day long if I wanted to stay fat. The BMR showed me that (1) it wasn\u2019t going to be hard to cut calories, and (2) I must have been making BIG mistakes before in order to consume those calories\u2014not small ones. That\u2019s good news. Big mistakes mean lots of low-hanging fruit. 1 \u201cNext was learning that 4,000 calories equals about a pound"

    "text": "of fat. I know Page 60 that\u2019s an oversimplification, but that\u2019s okay. Oversimplifying is one of the next things I\u2019ll mention as a tool. But if 4,000 is roughly a pound of fat, and my BMR makes it pretty easy to shave off some huge number of calories per day, it suddenly becomes very clear how to lose lots of weight without even doing any exercise. Add in some calculations on how many calories you burn doing, say, 30 minutes of exercise and you can pretty quickly come up with a formula that looks something like: BMR = 2,900 Actual intake = 1,800 Deficit from diet = BMR \u2013 actual intake = 1,100 Burned from 30 minutes cardio = 500 Total deficit = deficit from diet \u2013 burned from 30 minutes cardio = 1,600 \u201cSo that\u2019s 1,600 calories saved in a day, or almost half a pound of bad weight I could lose in a single day. So for a big round number, I can lose 5 pounds in a week and a half without even working too hard. When you\u2019re 50 pounds overweight, getting to 10% of your goal that fast is real . \u201c An important thing I alluded to earlier is that all of these numbers are in some ways bullshit. That\u2019s okay, and realizing that it was okay was one of the biggest shifts I had to make. When you\u2019re 50\u201370 pounds overweight (or I\u2019d say whenever you have a BIG change to make), worrying about counting calories consumed or burned slightly inaccurately is going to kill you. The fact of the matter is, there are no tools available to normal people which will tell us exactly how much energy we\u2019re burning or consuming. But if you\u2019re just kinda right and, more important, the numbers are directionally right, you can make a big difference with them. \u201cHere\u2019s another helpful pseudo-science number: apparently, 10 pounds of weight loss is roughly a clothing size [XL \u2192 L \u2192 M]. That was a HUGE motivator. I loved donating clothes all year and doing guilt-free shopping. \u201cAs a nerd, I find myself too easily discouraged by data collection projects where it\u2019s difficult or impossible to collect accurate data. Training myself to forget that made all the difference. \u201cAdded to this knowledge was a basic understanding of how metabolism works. Here are the main things I changed: breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and five to six meals a day of roughly 200 calories each. How did I measure the calories? I didn\u2019t. I put together an exact meal plan for just ONE Page 61 week, bought all the ingredients, stuck to it religiously. From that point on, I didn\u2019t have to do the hard work anymore. I became aware after just one week of roughly how many calories were in a portion of different types of food and just guessed. Again, trying to literally count calories sucks and is demotivating. Setting up a rigid template for a week and then using it as a basic guide is sustainable and fun. \u201cJust a few more disconnected tips: \u201cI set up a workstation where I could pedal on a recumbent bike while working. I did real work, wrote parts of The Passionate Programmer , played video games, chatted with friends, and watched ridiculous television shows I\u2019d normally be ashamed to be wasting my time on all while staying in my aerobic zone. I know a lot of creative people who hate exercise because it\u2019s boring. I was in that camp too (I\u2019m not anymore \u2026 it changes once you get into it). The bike/desk was my savior. That mixed with a measurement system: \u201cI got a heart rate monitor (HRM) and started using it for EVERYTHING. I used it while pedaling to make sure that even when I was having fun playing a game I was doing myself some good. If you know your heart rate zones (easy to find on the Internet), the ambiguity non-fitness-experts feel with respect to exercise is removed. Thirty minutes in your aerobic zone is good exercise and burns fat. Calculate how many calories you burn (a good HRM will do it for you), and the experience is fun and motivating. I started wearing my HRM when I was doing things like annoying chores around the house. You can clean house fast and burn serious fat. That\u2019s not some"

But geeks don\u2019t know how to build muscle. And as I\u2019ve mentioned, geeks don\u2019t like to do things they don\u2019t know are going to work. We like data. We value expertise.

He had almost tripled his strength in all movements, and to estimate 10 pounds of lean muscle gain over those three months would be conservative. This would make his actual fat-loss closer to 18 pounds, not the scale\u2019s 8. His muscle gains slowed after this update e-mail, and the fat-loss once again began to show on the scale. He dropped from 185 to 173. Total weight lost: 72 pounds. But total fat lost? It\u2019s impossible to tell. In a rush to get started, I hadn\u2019t insisted on getting his bodyfat percentage measured. Not that I cared much. For the first time in my life, I saw my father weighing less than me. During his annual checkup four months later, his doctor remarked: \u201cYou realize you\u2019re younger now than you were a year ago. You may just live forever.\u201d It was a stark contrast to his 245 pounds at 56 just a year earlier. My dad had gone from risk of sudden heart attack to looking and feeling 10 years younger in 12 months. Regardless, he had become depressed about his results precisely when he should have been giving people high-fives. It takes just one such incident to ruin an entire program and months of progress. How can you prevent unnecessary moments of doubt? It just takes a few simple numbers to steer the ship\u2014to know, without fail, when something is working and when it is not. Until you finish this chapter, do not pass go. If you want to skip directly to the actions, jump to \u201cStarting Your Physical GPS\u201d on this page . In fact, I suggest this for the first read through. Choosing the Right Tools I used to have a signature move while driving. About a quarter-mile or so before arriving at my hard-fought destination, often Page 67 within 200 feet, I would come to the unwavering conclusion that I\u2019d gone too far. Then I would U-turn and drive in the opposite direction, only to repeat the drill like a dog tethered to a clothesline. Best-case scenario, this shuttle run doubled my travel time. Worst-case scenario, I got so frustrated that I abandoned the trip altogether. This is exactly what most people do with fat-loss and exercise. Using a blunt instrument like a scale (the equivalent of the odometer in my example) people often conclude they\u2019re not making progress when, in fact, they are making tremendous progress. This leads to a musical chairs of fad diets and demoralizing last-ditch efforts that do more harm than good. To hit your target 20-pound recomposition, you\u2019ll need to track the right numbers. The scale is one tool, and you should use it, but it is not king. It can mislead. Take this unedited feedback from Angel, who was two weeks into the Slow-Carb Diet at the time (see \u201cThe Slow-Carb Diet I and II\u201d chapters): After my cheat day on Saturday, I gained 1 pound which is normal for me \u2026 week two, I lost that 1 pound. I didn\u2019t lose any [additional] weight on week two, but I\u2019m not discouraged. I did manage to lose in inches. I lost \u00bd an inch off my hips which is absolutely great. I lost a total of 1 inch off my thighs. Not so shabby either. So that\u2019s a total of 1.5 inches for the week. I\u2019ll take the inches. The grand total of inches lost from Day One: 5 inches \u2026 Yippee! No exercise either. My driving issues ended when I bought a GPS device. The GPS fixed my problem because it could answer the simple question: was I getting closer to my destination? In body redesign, our \u201cdestination\u201d is a better ratio of body composition , not weight. How much of you is useful muscle and how much of you is useless fat? Our constant companions will be circumference and bodyfat measurements. By the end of this chapter, you will have a starting point for your own physical GPS. This will guide you to your 20-pound recomposition goal. Circumference is easy enough: use a tape measure. We\u2019ll cover the details at the end of this chapter. But how do we actually measure bodyfat percentage? It turns out, there are a lot of options, and the most"

    "text": "common are the worst. Page 68 Skinning the Cat In one 24-hour period, 4 I took more than a dozen bodyfat measurements using the easiest-to-find, as well as the most sophisticated, equipment available. Here are some of the results, from lowest to highest: 7%\u20143-point with SlimGuide calipers 7.1\u20139.4%\u2014Accu-measure 9.5%\u2014BodyMetrix ultrasound 11.3%\u2014DEXA 13.3%\u2014BodPod 14.7\u201315.4%\u2014Omron hand-held bio-impedance (second value after drinking two liters of water in five minutes) 15.46\u201316.51%\u20144-site SlimGuide calipers The range is 7% to 16.51%. So then, which of these bad boys is accurate? The truth is, none of them are accurate. Moreover, this doesn\u2019t matter. We just need to make sure that the method we choose is consistent. The following table shows the various techniques I considered, ordered from most to least error-prone. 5 Provided by Luiz Da Silva, PhD., scientific advisory board, UC Davis National Science Foundation Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology. Page 69 After dozens of trials with multiple subjects, and taking into account both constancy and convenience (including cost), there were three clear winners: 6 1. DEXA 2. BodPod 3. Ultrasound (BodyMetrix) The Top 3 DEXA Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which costs $50\u2013100 per session, ended up my favorite, as it is repeatable and offers valuable information besides bodyfat percentage. The GE Lunar Prodigy, the machine I used, is designed for bone density testing and splits the body into different zones: My DEXA scan image. If you\u2019re not concerned about osteoporosis, why is this interesting? Because it highlights muscular imbalances between the left and right sides. In my case: Page 70 Left arm\u20144.6 kg Right arm\u20144.7 kg (I\u2019m right-handed, so not surprising) Left leg\u201412.4 kg Right leg\u201412.8 kg Left trunk\u201418.9 kg Right trunk\u201417.9 kg As we\u2019ll see in \u201cPre-hab,\u201d making yourself injury-proof requires, above all, correcting left-right imbalances. In five to ten minutes, DEXA gives a crystal- clear picture of mass imbalances that even outstanding physical therapists can miss after hours of observation. BODPOD Costing just $25\u201350, BodPod uses air displacement and is comparable to the clinical \u201cgold standard\u201d of hydrostatic underwater weighing. The subject (you) sits inside a sealed capsule, and alternating air pressures determine body composition. Infinitely faster and more comfortable than underwater weighing, the BodPod is the official bodyfat measurement device of the NFL Combine, where the 330 best college football players are analyzed by NFL coaches and scouts to determine their worth. Unlike calipers and some other methods, BodPod can accommodate obese subjects of 500+ pounds. BODYMETRIX BodyMetrix is a hand-held ultrasound device that tells you the exact thickness of fat (in millimeters) wherever you place it. It ended up being the tool I used most often and still use most often. Ultrasound has been used for more than a decade to determine the fat and muscular characteristics of livestock. Want to see how that intramuscular marbling is coming along on your living Kobe beef? Pull out the pregnancy cam! It\u2019s amazing that it took so long to reach athletics. The next-generation BodyMetrix wand, small enough to fit in a jacket pocket, connects to any PC with a USB cable and is now used by world-famous teams like the New York Yankees and AC Milan football. It is the picture of simplicity: I was able to take frequent readings in less than two minutes, and both data and images were automatically uploaded to my Mac. (The PC software actually runs faster on a Mac using Parallels \u00ae , a program that allows you to use PC software on Macs.) Page 71 Rather than attempt to find a gym that offered this for per-session fees, I decided to own a unit. At $2,000 for the professional unit, it was worth the convenience. There is a personal version in development that will cost less than $500. Can\u2019t Find the Fancy Stuff? If you choose to use calipers or bio-impedance (any tool you hold or"

    "text": "stand on) out of convenience, or if you use them for more frequent measurement alongside one of the Top Three, here are critical points to consider: 1. NEVER COMPARE BEFORE-AND-AFTER RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT TOOLS. 7 Results from different tools cannot be compared. In my 24-hour measurement marathon, I tested 13.3% with BodPod and 11.3% with DEXA. Let\u2019s say I had tested using only DEXA at 11.3% and then tested on BodPod for my follow-up, which resulted in 12.3%. I would wrongly conclude that I\u2019d gained 1% bodyfat, whereas I would have seen a more accurate 1% loss had I used BodPod for both. 2. IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE BIO-ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE (BEI), 8 YOU NEED CONSISTENT HYDRATION. Using bio-impedance devices, I have been able to make my bodyfat percentage jump almost 1% in five minutes by drinking two liters of water in between measurements. Here\u2019s a simple approach that largely fixes hydration issues: Immediately upon waking, drink 1.5 liters (about 50 fluid ounces) of cold water 9 \u2014ensure that water temperature is the same day to day\u2014and wait 30 minutes. Urinate and then test bodyfat using bio-impedance. Do not eat or drink anything else before testing. I use two empty Bulleit bourbon bottles (750 milliliters \u00d7 2 = 1.5 liters) because I love the old-school bottles, but Nalgene bottles are generally one liter each and have line measurements on the side. Wine and most liquor is also standardized for a 750-milliliter bottle size. 3. IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE CALIPERS, YOU NEED A CONSISTENT ALGORITHM. Even with the same calipers, using different math = different results. I suggest asking the gym or trainer to use a 3-point or 7-point Jackson-Pollock algorithm, which I have found gives the most consistent results compared to the Top Three. 10 This should be as simple as selecting from a drop-down menu in their software. Page 72 Starting Your Physical GPS\u2014The Steps Starting a body recomposition program without measurements is like planning a trip without a start address. I guarantee you will regret it later. Don\u2019t fly blind. My father, who lost more than 70 pounds and more than tripled his strength, is still kicking himself for not having bodyfat numbers. Drop a dime or two and get your data. If need be, skip a few lattes and a dinner out. Next steps: 1. Take your \u201cbefore\u201d circumference measurements. Get a simple tape measure and measure four locations: both upper arms (mid-bicep), waist (horizontal at navel), hips (at widest point below waist), and both legs (mid-thigh). Total these numbers to arrive at your Total Inches (TI) . Changes in this total will be meaningful enough to track. 2. Estimate your bodyfat (BF%) based on the \u201cEyeballing It\u201d sidebar on this page . 3. Choose the best tool and schedule a session. If you\u2019re over 30% bodyfat, avoid calipers and use DEXA, BodPod, or ultrasound, in that order. If you cannot find these, opt for bio-impedance and follow the hydration rules mentioned earlier. If you are under 25%, still aim for DEXA, BodPod, or ultrasound. If you cannot find these, opt for calipers with a qualified professional (use the same person for all follow-up visits) and request the 3-point or 7-point Jackson- Pollock algorithm. If neither is available, use another algorithm that includes a leg measurement and at least three points total. Leg fat is tricky and needs to be included. Record the name of the algorithm used for future reference. TOOLS AND TRICKS OrbiTape One-handed Tape Measure ( www.fourhourbody.com/orbitape ) Measure any body part with military precision using this tape measure, the armed services\u2019 choice for physical examinations. Finding DEXA DEXA must be administered by licensed medical staff and so eliminates most gyms and health clubs. First, Google your city, plus \u201cDEXA Page 73 body fat.\u201d If that fails, search \u201cDEXA,\u201d \u201costeoporosis testing,\u201d or \u201cbone density testing\u201d for your zip code or city.

Use this site to find BodPod assessment centers, which are located in almost all 50 states. BodyMetrix ( www.fourhourbody.com/bodymetrix ) The hand-held BodyMetrix device uses ultrasound to measure body composition down to the millimeter.

Cosmetic Fat vs. Evil Fat\u2014How to Measure Visceral Fat ( www.fourhourbody.com/evil ) Ever wonder how some people, especially older men, can have beer bellies that seem as tight as a drum? Distended abdomens that seem like muscle if you poke them? The answer is unpleasant: rather than fat under the skin, it\u2019s fat around internal organs that presses the abdominal wall out. One weakness of calipers and ultrasound is that they can only directly measure subcutaneous fat (under the skin) and not what\u2019s called visceral fat (around the organs). This article, authored by Michael Eades MD and Mary Dan Eades MD, explains a low-tech method for estimating the latter, which is particularly important for those over 25% bodyfat or of middle-age and older. Page 74 What should your bodyfat goals be? For most people, I suggest the following as a starting point: For men: If obese, aim for 20%. If you have just a bit of extra padding, aim for 12%. For women: If obese, aim for 25%. If you have just a bit of extra padding, aim for 18%. If you (male or female) want to get to 5%, we\u2019ll help you later. Use the pictures on this page or this page and descriptions (whatever is most helpful) to estimate your current bodyfat percentage. Where are you really? Look at the pics before reading the rest, as you might be able to skip the text. The following percentages and descriptions are intended to reflect high-end caliper readings on males, but the guidelines are still helpful for women. Keep in mind that since calipers measure a skinfold, both subcutaneous fat and subcutaneous water are reflected in the numbers. Special credit to Surferph34 for the guidelines and photo links: 11 20% Bodyfat There is no visible muscle definition and only a hint of separation between major muscle groups if those groups are large and well developed. For examples, see: www.fourhourbody.com/20a www.fourhourbody.com/20b www.fourhourbody.com/20c 15% Bodyfat Some muscle separation appears between the shoulders (deltoids) and upper arms. Abs are not visible. For an example, see: www.fourhourbody.com/15a www.fourhourbody.com/bodyfat-examples Page 75 12% Bodyfat More muscle separation appears, particularly in the chest and back, and an outline of the abs begins to appear. Standing under a ceiling light with favorable shadows, a pending four-pack might be visible. For examples, see: www.fourhourbody.com/12a www.fourhourbody.com/12b 10% Bodyfat Muscle separations get deeper in the arms, chest, legs, and back, and six-pack abs are visible when flexed. For an example, see: www.fourhourbody.com/10a 7\u20139% Bodyfat Abs are clearly visible all the time, vascularity in arms is prominent, chest and back separation is obvious, and the face starts to appear more angular.

These error ranges assume trained professionals and optimum conditions for measurements (e.g., good hydration for body-impedance). The order was determined using the median of their lower and upper error percentages. 6. In an ideal world, X-ray CT and MRI would be used, but I omitted them due to radiation and cost, respectively. 7. Nor should you compare different algorithms on the same equipment. This most frequently causes confusion when you get caliper readings from different trainers. Use the same person and same algorithm (e.g., 3-point Jackson-Pollock). 8. Also referred to as bio-impedance, or BI. 9. The coldness of the water will also help fat-loss. 10.

He blinked a few times. 199.2. Then he blinked a few more times. \u201cHoly crap!\u201d He\u2019d put on about 10 pounds a year after sophomore year in high school, tipping the scales at 240 pounds at college graduation. Now, for the first time since his teens, Trevor weighed less than 200 pounds. That had been the goal since stepping on a treadmill almost two years earlier, but a distant goal. Breaking the 200 barrier had seemed unattainable. Now he\u2019d done it. The question wasn\u2019t so much how he did it. The real question was: why did it work? Simple. He\u2019d made an agreement with a coworker: they would go to the gym together three times per week, and if either of them missed a session, that person had to pay the other $1. In his first gym visit, Trevor walked for four minutes on the treadmill. Not long thereafter, he ran a mile for the first time since fourth grade. Now he has run two half-marathons. It\u2019s not the $1 that matters (Trevor does quite well), it\u2019s the underlying psychology.

    "text": "eat a full bag of Twizzlers prior to takeoff. He then proceeded to eat a full bag of Oreos, which he polished off before we had reached cruising altitude. It was an impressive display. I recall asking myself: How can he rationalize eating so much? He had a cane, for God\u2019s sake. The answer was, of course, that he couldn\u2019t. I doubt he\u2019d even tried. There was no logical justification for his behavior, but then again, there is no logical justification for how I hit the snooze button every 10 minutes for an hour or two every Saturday. We break commitments to ourselves with embarrassing regularity. How can someone trying to lose weight binge on an entire pint of ice cream before bed? How can even the most disciplined of executives fail to make 30 minutes of time per week for exercise? How can someone whose marriage depends on quitting smoking pick up a cigarette? Simple: logic fails. If you were to summarize the last 100 years of behavioral psychology in two words, that would be the takeaway. Fortunately, knowing this, it is possible to engineer compliance. Pulling from both new and often-neglected data, including photographic research and auctions, there are four principles of failure-proofing behavior. Think of them as insurance against the weaknesses of human nature\u2014your weaknesses, my weaknesses, our weaknesses: 1. Make it conscious. 2. Make it a game. 3. Make it competitive. 4. Make it small and temporary. 1. MAKE IT CONSCIOUS: FLASHING AND \u201cBEFORE\u201d PHOTOS The fastest way to correct a behavior is to be aware of it in real time, not after- the-fact. The curious case of the so-called \u201cflash diet\u201d is a prime example of the difference. Dr. Lydia Zepeda and David Deal of the University of Wisconsin\u2013 Madison enlisted 43 subjects to photograph all of their meals or snacks prior to Page 90 eating. Unlike food diaries, which require time- consuming entries often written long after eating, the photographs acted as an instantaneous intervention and forced people to consider their choices before the damage was done. In the words of one participant: \u201cI was less likely to have a jumbo bag of M&Ms. It curbed my choices. It didn\u2019t alter them completely, but who wants to take a photo of a jumbo bag of M&Ms?\u201d The researchers concluded that photographs are more effective than written food diaries. This is saying something, as prior studies had confirmed that subjects who use food diaries lose three times as much weight as those who don\u2019t. The upshot: use your camera phone to take a snapshot before opening your mouth. Even without a prescribed diet, this awareness alone will result in fat-loss. The camera can also be used to accentuate your flaws \u2026 to your benefit. If we analyze the post-contest submissions of the winners of the Body- for- Life Challenge, the largest physique transformation contest in the last 50 years of publishing, we can isolate one common understated element: \u201cbefore\u201d photographs. The training methods and diet varied, but those who experienced the most dramatic changes credited the \u201cbefore\u201d photographs with adherence to the program. The pictures were placed in an unavoidable spot, often on the refrigerator, and served as inoculation against self-sabotage. Get an accurate picture of your baseline. It will look worse than you expect. This need not be bad news. Ignoring it won\u2019t fix it, so capture it and use it. 2. MAKE IT A GAME: JACK STACK AND THE STICKINESS OF FIVE SESSIONS Jack Stack was nervous. It was 1983, and he had just joined his employees to purchase SRC, a near-bankrupt engine remanufacturer, from their parent company, International Harvester. It was done in remarkable fashion, with $100,000 applied to a loan of $9 million, for a debt ratio of 89-to-1. The bank officer who handled the loan was fired within hours of approving it. The 13 managers who contributed their life savings to make it possible were also nervous, but they needn\u2019t have been. That $100,000 would be worth $23 million in 1993, just 10 years later. By"

Page 91 Jack Stack taught all of his employees how to read the financial statements, opened the books, and put numerical goals alongside individual performance numbers on grease boards around the plant. Daily goals and public accountability were combined with daily rewards and public recognition. The Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company in Cicero, Illinois, also figured this out, albeit accidentally. The year was 1955, and their finding was significant: increasing lighting in the plant made workers more productive. Then someone pointed out (I have to imagine a sweaty- palmed intern) a confusing detail. Productivity also improved when they dimmed the lighting! In fact, making any change at all seemed to result in increased productivity. It turned out that, with each change, the workers suspected they were being observed and therefore worked harder. This phenomenon\u2014also called the \u201cobserver effect\u201d\u2014came to be known as \u201cthe Hawthorne Effect.\u201d Reinforced by research in game design, Jack Stack and Western Electric\u2019s results can be condensed into a simple equation: measurement = motivation . Seeing progress in changing numbers makes the repetitive fascinating and creates a positive feedback loop. Once again, the act of measuring is often more important than what you measure. To quote the industrial statistician George Box: \u201cEvery model is wrong, but some are useful.\u201d It\u2019s critical that you measure something. But that begets the question: to replace self-discipline, how often do you need to record things? That is, how many times do you need to log data to get hooked and never stop? In the experience of the brilliant Nike+ team, and in the experience of their users, more than 1.2 million runners who have tracked more than 130 million miles, that magic number is five: If someone uploads only a couple of runs to the site, they might just be trying it out. But once they hit five runs, they\u2019re massively more likely to keep running and uploading data. At five runs, they\u2019ve gotten hooked on what their data tells them about themselves. Aristotle had it right, but he was missing a number: \u201cWe are what we do repeatedly.\u201d A mere five times (five workouts, five meals, five of whatever we want) will be our goal. When in doubt, \u201ctake five\u201d is the rule. 3. MAKE IT COMPETITIVE: FEAR OF LOSS AND THE BENEFITS OF COMPARISON Page 92 Would you work harder to earn $100 or to avoid losing $100? If research from the Center for Experimental Social Science at New York University is any indication, fear of loss is the winner. Their three-group experiment looked like this: the first group received $15 and was told the $15 would be taken back if they lost a subsequent auction; the second group was told they\u2019d be given $15 if they won the auction; and the third group was a control with no incentive. The first group routinely overbid the most. Participating economist Eric Schotter explained the results: Economists typically attribute excessive bidding to risk aversion, or the joy of winning. What we found is that the actual cause of overbidding is a fear of losing, a completely new theory from past investigations. This is not a depressing realization. It\u2019s a useful one. Knowing that potential loss is a greater motivator than potential reward, we can set you up for success by including a tangible risk of public failure. Real weight-loss numbers support this. Examining random 500-person samples from the 500,000+ users of DailyBurn, a diet and exercise tracking website, those who compete against their peers in \u201cchallenges\u201d lose an average of 5.9 pounds more than those who do not compete. There is another phenomenon that makes groups an ideal environment for change: social comparison theory. In plain English, it means that, in a group, some people will do worse than you (\u201cSarah lost"

Looking at DailyBurn\u2019s data set, those who have three or more \u201cmotivators\u201d in their peer group lose an average of 5.8 pounds more than those with fewer. Embrace peer pressure. It\u2019s not just for kids. 4. MAKE IT SMALL AND TEMPORARY That brings us to your most important next steps, detailed below. Questions and Actions Before you move on to another chapter, take (or in the case of #2, start ) at least Page 93 two of the following four actions. Your choice: 1. Do I really look like that in underwear? Take digital photos of yourself from the front, back, and side. Wear either underwear or a bathing suit. Not eager to ask a neighbor for a favor? Use a camera with a timer or a computer webcam like the Mac iSight. Put the least flattering \u201cbefore\u201d photo somewhere you will see it often: the refrigerator, bathroom mirror, dog\u2019s forehead, etc. 2. Do I really eat that? Use a digital camera or camera phone to take photographs of everything you eat for 3\u20135 days, preferably including at least one weekend day. For sizing, put your hand next to each item or plate in the photographs. For maximum effect, put these photos online for others to see. 3. Who can I get to do this with me? Find at least one person to engage in a friendly competition using either total inches (TI) or bodyfat percentage. Weight is a poor substitute but another option. Use competitive drive, guilt, and fear of humiliation to your advantage. Embrace the stick. The carrot is overrated. 4. How do I measure up? Get a simple tape measure and measure five locations: both upper arms (mid-bicep), waist (horizontal at navel), hips (widest point between navel and legs), and both legs (mid-thigh). Total these numbers to arrive at your total inches (TI) . I\u2019m telling you again because I know you didn\u2019t do it after the last chapter. Get off your ass and get \u2019er done. It takes five minutes. 5. What is the smallest meaningful change I can make? Make it small. Small is achievable. For now, this means getting started on at least two of the above four steps before moving on. The rest and best is yet to come. TOOLS AND TRICKS Grossly Dramatic and Realistic Fat Replicas ( www.fourhourbody.com/fatreplica ) These are disgusting but effective motivators. I keep a one-pound fat replica in the drawer of my refrigerator. The five-pound replica is the most effective visual aid I\u2019ve ever seen for getting otherwise resistant people to lose fat.

Ramit Sethi has always joked about his \u201cIndian frailty.\u201d He had wanted to add muscle to his 127-pound frame for years, but it didn\u2019t happen until he made one simple addition to his life: another bet. Ramit has an Page 95 entire folder in his Gmail dedicated to bets against friends, all adding up to about $8,000 in prize money. This time, he bet them all that he could gain 15 pounds of muscle in three months. In the first seven days alone, he gained five pounds and was the heaviest he\u2019d ever been. In the end, he added 20% to his bodyweight\u2014surpassing 15 pounds \u2014while keeping his bodyfat low. Now, three years later, he\u2019s maintained his new muscular weight almost to the exact pound. There were three reasons it worked after years of failing to gain weight. 1. He used a bet and tracked results publicly Ramit set up a free PBworks wiki page (like the pages found on Wikipedia) and invited all the bettors to receive notifications when he updated his weight. He then proceeded to talk an ungodly amount of trash. Needless to say, smack-talking would make him look doubly stupid if he didn\u2019t win the bet. Ramit elaborates on the accountability: \u201cUse psychology to help; don\u2019t just \u2018try harder.\u2019 If you\u2019ve repeatedly tried (or committed to do) something and it hasn\u2019t worked, consider public compliance or a bet.\u201d Page 96 2. He ignored almost everyone From Ramit: \u201cEveryone has a damn opinion. Some people told me I would get fat, as if I would let that happen for a few hundred bucks. And of course, everyone had theories about what to eat, drink, and even what combination of weights to lift. \u201cMore than a few people shrieked upon finding out my strategy (working out, running, and eating more): \u2018What!? You can\u2019t run! You\u2019ll lose too much weight!\u2019 All I could do was point out that it seemed to be working: I\u2019d already completed one-third of the bet in the first seven days. There wasn\u2019t much they could say to that. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got an opinion about what you \u2018should\u2019 do. But the truth is, most of them are full of hot air and you can get it done using a few simple steps. \u201cI ignored every one of them.\u201d 3. He focused on the method, not the mechanism \u201cPeople warned me that I had to understand how lipids and carbs and fatty acids worked before I started. That\u2019s such nonsense. What if I just started working out Page 97 and ate more? Could I learn all that fancy stuff later? You don\u2019t have to be a genius to gain or lose weight.\u201d 4. Make it small and temporary: the immense practicality of baby steps \u201cTake the pressure off.\u201d Michael Levin has made a career of taking the pressure off, and it has worked. Sixty literary works later, from national nonfiction bestsellers to screenplays, he was suggesting that I (Tim) do the same: set a meager goal of two pages of writing per day. I had made a mental monster of the book in your hands, and setting the bar low allowed me to do what mattered most: get started each morning. Dr. B. J. Fogg, founder of the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University, wrote his graduate dissertation with a far less aggressive commitment. Even if he came home from a party at 3:00 A.M. , he had to write one sentence per day. He finished in record time while classmates languished for years, overwhelmed by the enormity of the task.

    "text": "its salespeople were the lowest in the industry because management wanted the reps to be unintimidated to do one thing: pick up the phone. Momentum took care of the rest, and quotas were exceeded quarter after quarter. Taking off the pressure in 4HB means doing experiments that are short in duration and not overly inconvenient. Don\u2019t look at a diet change or a new exercise as something you need to commit to for six months, much less the rest of your life. Look at it as a test drive of one to two weeks. If you want to walk an hour a day, don\u2019t start with one hour. Choosing one hour is automatically building in the excuse of not having enough time. Commit to a fail-proof five minutes instead. This is exactly what Dr. Fogg suggested to his sister, and that one change (the smallest meaningful change that created momentum) led her to buy running shoes and stop eating dessert, neither of which he suggested. These subsequent decisions are referred to in the literature as \u201cconsonant decisions,\u201d decisions we make to be aligned with a prior decision. Take the pressure off and do something small. Remember our target to log five sessions of new behaviors? It\u2019s the five sessions that are important, not the duration of those sessions. Rig the game so Page 98 you can win. Do what\u2019s needed to make those first five sessions as painless as possible. Five snowflakes are all you need to start the snowball effect of consonant decisions. Take the pressure off and put in your five easy sessions, whether meals or workouts. The rest will take care of itself. Page 99 In 2008, a 258-pound Phil Libin decided to experiment with laziness. He wanted to lose weight. This is common. As is also common, he wasn\u2019t particularly keen on diet or exercise. He\u2019d tried both off and on for years. The intermittent four- to eight-week programs helped him drop pounds\u2014and then his other behaviors helped him gain them back even faster. He began to suspect there might be an easier way: doing nothing. Phil had a simple method in mind: \u201cI wanted to see what effect being precisely aware of my weight would have on my weight.\u201d This is where we depart from the common. Phil lost 28 pounds in six months without making the slightest attempt to change his behavior. First, having arbitrarily decided that 230 pounds was his ideal weight, Phil drew a blue line in an Excel spreadsheet. The downward slope represented his weight decreasing from 258 to 230 over two years. Every day\u2019s target weight, which sat on the blue line, was just 0.1% (approximately) lower than the previous day\u2019s. Easy peasy. See his graph on the next page, where the \u201cblue\u201d line is the middle dashed line. He then added in two important lines below and above his \u201ctarget\u201d blue line: his minimum-allowable weight (green line) and his maximum-allowable weight (red line) for each day. He had no plan to hit his exact target weight each day, as that would be too stressful. He just had to keep between the lines. Page 100 Interested in Phil\u2019s Excel spreadsheet? Download a blank version at www.fourhourbody.com/phil . Just input your starting weight and desired ending weight, and you can duplicate his experiment. How? He weighed himself naked every morning at the same time before eating breakfast. He stepped on the scale a few times and put the average of the results in his Excel spreadsheet. The jagged line above shows his actual weight changes. Gaps represent periods of travel when he didn\u2019t have access to a scale. Phil kept the spreadsheet in the program he helped pioneer, Evernote.com , so that he could see it from any computer or phone. It was always at his fingertips. It was pure 100% awareness training, nothing but tracking. In fact, Phil made a concerted effort not to change: \u201cI actually made a conscious effort not to deviate from my diet or exercise routine during this experiment. That is, I continued to eat whatever I wanted and got absolutely no exercise. The goal was to see how just the situational awareness of where I"

I suspect it affected thousands of minute decisions that I made over the time period, even though I couldn\u2019t tell you which.\u201d Oddly, he treated excessive drift upward (gaining) or downward (losing) as equally bad: \u201cThe only times I sprang into deliberate action were the few times (seen on the graph) where my weight dipped below the minimum acceptable level. Then I Page 101 would eat doughnuts or gorge myself to make sure I was back in the \u2018safe zone\u2019 the next day. That was a lot of fun.

Page 103 SUBTRACTING FAT Basics Page 104 THE SLOW-CARB DIET I How to Lose 20 Pounds in 30 Days Without Exercise Out of clutter, find simplicity. \u2014Albert Einstein 11:34 A.M. SATURDAY, JUNE 20, 2009, SAN FRANCISCO T ext message from London, eight hours ahead, meant to impress: This is my dinner. Happy times! The accompanying photo: a pepperoni and sausage pizza so large it doesn\u2019t fit on the screen. Chris A., a fellow experimenter, and I were having our weekly virtual date. Text response from me: This is my breakfast. BREAKFAST. Can you hear the insulin pouring out of my eyes? Woohoo! Ante up, fat boy. My accompanying photo: two bear claws, two chocolate croissants, grapefruit juice, and a large coffee. Response from Chris: LOL \u2026 please don\u2019t make me do this \u2026 And so it continued, a text-message eating contest. The truth is, I do some version of this every Saturday, and thousands of people over the last four years have joined me in doing the same. In between pizzas and bear claws, the net result is that the average follower has lost 19 pounds of fat, and a surprising number have lost more than 100 pounds total. This odd approach has produced something of a small revolution. Let me explain exactly how Chris and I reach and maintain sub-12% bodyfat, often sub-10%, by strategically eating like pigs. Page 105 The Slow-Carb Diet\u2014 Better Fat-Loss Through Simplicity It is possible to lose 20 pounds of bodyfat in 30 days by optimizing any of three factors: exercise, diet, or a drug/supplement regimen. Twenty pounds for most people means moving down at least two clothing sizes, whether that\u2019s going from a size 14 dress to a size 10 or from an XXL shirt to a large. The waist and hips show an even more dramatic reduction in circumference. By April 6, 2007, as an example, I had cut from nearly 180 pounds to 165 pounds in six weeks, while adding about 10 pounds of muscle, which means I lost approximately 25 pounds of fat. The changes aren\u2019t subtle. The diet that I\u2019ll introduce in this chapter\u2014the Slow-Carb Diet\u2014is the only diet besides the rather extreme Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD) that has produced veins across my abdomen, which is the last place I lose fat. There are just five simple rules to follow: RULE #1: AVOID \u201cWHITE\u201d CARBOHYDRATES. Avoid any carbohydrate that is, or can be, white. The following foods are prohibited, except for within 30 minutes of finishing a resistance-training workout like those described in the \u201cFrom Geek to Freak\u201d or \u201cOccam\u2019s Protocol\u201d chapters: all bread, rice (including brown), cereal, potatoes, pasta, tortillas, and fried food with breading. If you avoid eating the aforementioned foods and anything else white, you\u2019ll be safe. Just for fun, another reason to avoid the whities: chlorine dioxide, one of the chemicals used to bleach flour (even if later made brown again, a common trick), combines with residual protein in most of these foods to form alloxan. Researchers use alloxan in lab rats to induce diabetes. That\u2019s"

RULE #2: EAT THE SAME FEW MEALS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. The most successful dieters, regardless of whether their goal is muscle gain or fat-loss, eat the same few meals over and over again. There are 47,000 products in the average U.S. grocery store, but only a handful of them won\u2019t make you fat. Mix and match from the following list, constructing each meal with one pick from each of the three groups. I\u2019ve starred the choices that produce the fastest fat-loss for me: Page 106 Proteins *Egg whites with 1\u20132 whole eggs for flavor (or, if organic, 2\u20135 whole eggs, including yolks) *Chicken breast or thigh *Beef (preferably grass-fed) *Fish Pork Legumes *Lentils (also called \u201cdal\u201d or \u201cdaal\u201d) *Black beans Pinto beans Red beans Soybeans Vegetables *Spinach *Mixed vegetables (including broccoli, cauliflower, or any other cruciferous vegetables) *Sauerkraut, kimchee (full explanation of these later in \u201cDamage Control\u201d) Asparagus Peas Broccoli Green beans Eat as much as you like of the above food items, but keep it simple. Pick three or four meals and repeat them. Almost all restaurants can give you a salad or vegetables in place of french fries, potatoes, or rice. Surprisingly, I have found Mexican food (after swapping out rice for vegetables) to be one of the cuisines most conducive to the Slow-Carb Diet. If you have to pay an extra $1\u20133 to substitute at a restaurant, consider it your six-pack tax, the nominal fee you pay to be lean. Most people who go on \u201clow\u201d-carbohydrate diets complain of low energy and quit because they consume insufficient calories. A half-cup of rice is 300 calories, whereas a half-cup of spinach is 15 calories! Vegetables are not Page 107 calorically dense, so it is critical that you add legumes for caloric load. Eating more frequently than four times per day might be helpful on higher- carb diets to prevent gorging, but it\u2019s not necessary with the ingredients we\u2019re using. Eating more frequent meals also appears to have no enhancing effect on resting metabolic rate, despite claims to the contrary. Frequent meals can be used in some circumstances (see \u201cThe Last Mile\u201d), but not for this reason. The following meal schedule is based on a late sleep schedule, as I\u2019m a night owl who gives up the ghost at 2:00 A.M . at the earliest, usually with wineglass or book still in hand, \u00e0 la heroin addict. Adjust your meals to fit your schedule, but make sure to have your first meal within an hour of waking. Meals are approximately four hours apart. 10:00 A.M .\u2014Breakfast 2:00 P.M .\u2014Lunch 6:30 P.M .\u2014Smaller second lunch 8:00\u20139:00 P.M .\u2014Recreation or sports training, if scheduled. 10:00 P.M .\u2014Dinner 12:00 A.M .\u2014Glass of red wine and Discovery Channel before bed Here are some of my meals that recur again and again: \u2022 Breakfast (home): Scrambled Eggology \u00ae pourable egg whites with one whole egg, black beans, and mixed vegetables warmed up or cooked in a microwave using Pyrex \u00ae containers. \u2022 Lunch (Mexican restaurant): Grass-fed organic beef, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and extra guacamole. \u2022 Dinner (home): Grass-fed organic beef (from Trader Joe\u2019s), lentils, and mixed vegetables. Just remember: this diet is, first and foremost, intended to be effective, not fun. It can be fun with a few tweaks (the next chapter covers this), but that\u2019s not the goal. RULE #3: DON\u2019T DRINK CALORIES. Drink massive quantities of water and as much unsweetened tea, coffee (with no more than two tablespoons of cream; I suggest using cinnamon instead), or other no-calorie/low-calorie beverages as you like. Do not drink milk (including soy Page 108 milk), normal soft drinks, or fruit juice. Limit diet soft drinks to no more than 16 ounces per day if you can, as the aspartame can stimulate weight gain. I\u2019m a wine fanatic and have one to two glasses of red wine almost every evening. It doesn\u2019t appear to have any"

Up to two glasses of red per night, no more. RULE #4: DON\u2019T EAT FRUIT. Humans don\u2019t need fruit six days a week, and they certainly don\u2019t need it year- round. If your ancestors were from Europe, for example, how much fruit did they eat in the winter 500 years ago? Think they had Florida oranges in December? Not a chance. But you\u2019re still here, so the lineage somehow survived. The only exceptions to the no-fruit rule are tomatoes and avocadoes, and the latter should be eaten in moderation (no more than one cup or one meal per day). Otherwise, just say no to fruit and its principal sugar, fructose, which is converted to glycerol phosphate more efficiently than almost all other carbohydrates. Glycerol phosphate \u2192 triglycerides (via the liver) \u2192 fat storage. There are a few biochemical exceptions to this, but avoiding fruit six days per week is the most reliable policy. But what\u2019s this \u201csix days a week\u201d business? It\u2019s the seventh day that allows you, if you so desire, to eat peach crepes and banana bread until you go into a coma. RULE #5: TAKE ONE DAY OFF PER WEEK. I recommend Saturdays as your Dieters Gone Wild (DGW) day. I am allowed to eat whatever I want on Saturdays, and I go out of my way to eat ice cream, Snickers, Take 5, and all of my other vices in excess. If I drank beer, I\u2019d have a few pints of Paulaner Hefe-Weizen. 1 I make myself a little sick each Saturday and don\u2019t want to look at any junk for the rest of the week. Paradoxically, dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat-loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function and conversion of T4 to T3, etc.) doesn\u2019t downshift from extended caloric restriction. That\u2019s right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat. Welcome to Utopia. There are no limits or boundaries during this day of gluttonous enjoyment. Page 109 There is absolutely no calorie counting on this diet, on this day or any other. Start the diet at least five days before your designated cheat day. If you choose Saturday, for example, I would suggest starting your diet on a Monday. That\u2019s All, Folks! If the founding fathers could sum up our government in a six-page constitution, the above is all we need to summarize rapid fat-loss for 99.99% of the population. Followed to the letter , I\u2019ve never seen it fail. Never. When you feel mired in details or confused by the latest-and-greatest contradictory advice, return to this short chapter. All you need to remember is: Rule #1: Avoid \u201cwhite\u201d carbohydrates (or anything that can be white). Rule #2: Eat the same few meals over and over again. Rule #3: Don\u2019t drink calories. Rule #4: Don\u2019t eat fruit. Rule #5: Take one day off per week and go nuts. For the finer points, we have the next chapter . Andrew Hyde is community director at TechStars, a well-known start-up incubator in Boulder, Colorado. He is also an Internet-famous big bargain hunter. I use \u201cbig\u201d in both the figurative and literal senses: Andrew is 6\u20325\u2033 and 245 pounds. I should say that he was 245 pounds. In his first two weeks on the Slow-Carb Diet, he lost 10 pounds and, perhaps more impressive, racked up incredibly un impressive costs: Total per-week food cost: $37.70 Average per-meal cost: $1.34 And this was including organic grass-fed beef! If he\u2019d eaten a big salad three times a week instead of a few proteins, his weekly cost would have been $31.70. He repeated four meals: Page 110 BREAKFAST: Egg whites, one whole egg, mixed vegetables, chicken breast LUNCH: Mixed vegetables, peas, spinach (salad) SECOND LUNCH: Chicken thigh, black beans, mixed vegtables DINNER: Beef (or pork), asparagus, pinto beans His exact shopping list was simplicity itself.

Though you might not get to $1.34 per meal, his two-week experiment shows what thousands of others have been surprised to learn about the Slow-Carb Diet: it\u2019s damn cheap. The myth that eating right is expensive is exactly that: a myth. Page 111 Can fruit juice really screw up fat-loss? Oh, yes. And it screws up much more. Not to speculate, I tested the effect of fructose in two tests, the first during a no-fructose diet (no juice, no fruit) and the second after one week of consuming 14 ounces\u2014about 1.5 large glasses\u2014of pulp-free orange juice upon waking and before bed. The orange juice was the only thing distinguishing diets A and B. The changes were incredible. Before (10/16, no fructose) and after (10/23, orange juice): Cholesterol: 203 \u2192 243 (out of \u201chealthy\u201d range) LDL: 127 \u2192 165 (also out of range) There were two other values that shot up unexpectedly: Albumin: 4.3 \u2192 4.9 (out of range) Iron: 71 \u2192 191 (!) (out of range aka into the stratosphere) Albumin binds to testosterone and renders it inert, much like SHBG (discussed in \u201cSex Machine\u201d) but weaker. I don\u2019t want either to be out-of-range high. Bad for the manly arts. If you said \u201cHoly sh*t!\u201d when you saw the iron jump, we\u2019re in the same boat. This result was completely out of the blue and is not good, especially in men. It might come as a surprise, but men don\u2019t menstruate. This means that men lack a good method for clearing out excessive iron, which can be toxic. 2 The increase in iron was far more alarming to me than the changes in cholesterol. Here is just one of several explanations from the research literature: In addition to contributing to metabolic abnormalities, the consumption of fructose has been reported to affect homeostasis of numerous trace elements. Fructose has been shown to increase iron absorption in humans and experimental animals. Fructose intake [also] decreases the activity of Page 112 the copper enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduces the concentration of serum and hepatic copper. The moral of the story? Don\u2019t drink fruit juice, and absolutely avoid a high- fructose diet. It doesn\u2019t do the body good.

    "text": "and Common Questions As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. \u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson The system is the solution. \u2014AT&T T his chapter answers the most common questions related to the Slow-Carb Diet, shares real-world lessons learned, and pinpoints the most common mistakes. I designate Saturday as \u201ccheat day\u201d in all of my answers, but, in practice, you can substitute any day of the week. Chances are good that at least 50% of the questions in this chapter will come up for you at some point. If you\u2019re serious about achieving the fastest fat-loss possible, read it all. Common Questions and Concerns HOW CAN I POSSIBLY FOLLOW THIS DIET? IT\u2019S TOO STRICT! Just start with changing your breakfast. You will lose noticeable fat. Be sure to see Fleur B. in \u201cPerfect Posterior,\u201d who lost about 3% bodyfat in four to five weeks with this one substitution. Once you see the results, suck it up and move to 100% slow-carb for six days, after which you can indulge yourself for 24 hours. Then again, would doing a one-week test from the get-go really be too much? I doubt it. \u201cPritibrowneyes\u201d developed a simple method for extending self- control: One thing that worked well for me was keeping a little notepad with me. Everytime I got a craving for something (sweet stuff or just regular food) I added it to the list of things I was going to feast on during my cheat day. This was my way of acknowledging my craving and reminding myself that I could have it, but just not right now. It\u2019s like deferred eating. Page 115 If that\u2019s not enough, don\u2019t forget sugar-free Jell-O. When you are on the verge of self-control breakdown, usually late at night, a few bites will put the demons back in their cages. BUT EATING THE SAME STUFF IS SO BORING! Most people vastly overestimate the variety of their meals. Assuming you\u2019re not traveling, what have you had to eat for breakfast for the last week? Lunch? Chances are good that, especially for breakfast, you\u2019ve repeated one to three meals. Rotating five or six meals for a few weeks is not hard at all, even though you might imagine otherwise. Feeling awesome and looking better each successive week easily justifies having familiar (tasty) food from Sunday to Friday. Saturday is no-holds-barred. Here\u2019s one of hundreds of examples of results trumping variety, this one from Jeff: I\u2019ve been going 2 weeks strong, and am down almost 15 lbs! I have this \u201close 30 before I\u2019m 30 years old\u201d plan and I\u2019m now halfway there with 4 months to go. I do egg-whites, Lentils, and broccoli in the A.M ., a burrito bowl (chicken, black beans, veggies) for lunch, then chicken, lentils and assorted veggies for dinner. All followed with some delicious red wine before bed. I admit I\u2019m already bored with the meals, but the results I\u2019m seeing so far make it a minimal concern. I add some different seasonings or light sauces to the chicken to mix it up\u2026 . I\u2019ve only had one cheat day so far, but am looking forward to my second one tomorrow. I may have overdid it last week, as I consumed almost 5,000 calories, where normally I\u2019m coming in around 1,200\u20131,300:); Surprisingly, that huge cheat day last week didn\u2019t set me back too far, as I was back to my pre-cheat weight by Monday morning. I don\u2019t like exercise, and haven\u2019t committed to it as part of my weight loss plan, but some folks at work get me to do 30\u201345 minutes on a elliptical or bike a couple times a week. Not sure if that\u2019s enough that it really has an impact or not, but at least it gets me off my butt. I\u2019m interested to see how the next 2 weeks go. I\u2019m under 200 lbs for the first time in years, and my goal is 185. Page 116 SHOULD I TAKE ANY SUPPLEMENTS? I suggest potassium, magnesium, and calcium. This diet will cause you to lose excess water, and electrolytes can go along with it. Potassium can be consumed during meals by using a potassium- enriched salt like \u201cLite Salt\u201d or, my preference, eating"

Avocadoes also contain 75% insoluble fiber, which will help keep you regular. If you prefer pills, 99-milligram tablets with meals will do the trick.

For the latter, whole milk clocks in at an attractive 27. Unfortunately, dairy products paradoxically have a high insulinemic response on the insulinemic index (II or InIn) scale. Researchers from Lund University in Sweden have examined this surprising finding: Despite low glycemic indexes of 15\u201330, all of the milk products produced high insulinemic indexes of 90\u201398, which were not significantly different from the insulinemic index of the reference bread [generally white bread].\u2026 Conclusions: Milk products appear insulinotropic as judged from 3-fold to 6-fold higher insulinemic indexes than expected from the corresponding glycemic indexes. Removing even a little dairy can dramatically accelerate fat-loss, as Murph noticed: Page 118 OK, it\u2019s been a week since taking Tim\u2019s advice and cutting the dairy. I\u2019m down 6 more pounds. And what\u2019s unbelievable to me is that I wasn\u2019t even consuming that much beforehand. Maybe a handful of cheese on my breakfast eggs, and a glass of milk per day. Need something to flavor your coffee? If you must, use cream (not milk), but no more than two tablespoons. I opt for a few dashes of cinnamon and the occasional drops of vanilla extract. NO FRUIT? DON\u2019T I NEED A \u201cBALANCED DIET\u201d? No. To begin with, there is no consensus on what a \u201cbalanced diet\u201d is. My researchers and I tried to find an official definition from the U.S. Department of Agriculture or other federal agencies, and we could not. I have not seen any evidence to suggest that fruits are necessary more than once a week on cheat day. See \u201cThe Forbidden Fruit\u201d sidebar in the last chapter for"

First, let\u2019s fix that bean issue, then I\u2019ll talk about how and when you can omit them. Lentils seldom cause the gas problem and are my default in the legume category. For beans, purchasing organic will often fix the rumbling pants effect, and if that doesn\u2019t work, soaking the beans in water for a few hours will help break down the offending cause: oligosaccharides. This is one of many reasons I eat canned beans and lentils, disposing of the murky juice in the can and rinsing, instead of purchasing either dry. If all else fails, add some Beano (Bean-zyme for you vegans) or epazote (available at Mexican grocery stores or online) to the beans and you\u2019re golden. Is it the blandness that\u2019s the problem? That\u2019s even easier to fix: add a little balsamic vinegar and garlic powder. I personally love hot sauce ( www.cholula.com is my current favorite). Try red beans instead of black or pinto. Perhaps it\u2019s the beany mouth feel and texture? Try fake mashed potatoes, which slow-carber Dana explains: Put a little olive oil in a pan \u2026 add a can of white kidney beans (or some Page 119 cauliflower), mash them with a spoon or whatever you choose, add a bit of water to get the consistency you want, season with a little bit of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and some parmesan cheese if you wish \u2026 tastes awesome and cooks in no time at all! The fake mashed potato approach also works well with simple refried beans \u2026 and don\u2019t forget to mix the beans with something else. My breakfast is often a concoction of mixed veggies with lentils and store-bought, mayonnaise- minimal coleslaw. It\u2019s 100 times better-tasting than the three eaten separately. Do you really have to eat beans every meal? No. Which leads up to the rules of omission. I do not eat beans with every meal because I eat out almost every lunch and dinner. If I\u2019m cooking, lentils and black beans are my defaults. Outside, I\u2019ll order extra protein and vegetables for the entr\u00e9e and supplement with one or two slow-carb appetizers, such as unbreaded calamari and a salad with olive oil and vinegar. If you omit legumes in a meal, you must absolutely make a concerted effort to eat larger portions than your former higher-carb self. Remember that you\u2019re getting fewer calories per cubic inch. Eat more than you are accustomed to. HOLY FESTIVUS, I GAINED EIGHT POUNDS AFTER MY CHEAT DAY! DID I UNDO ALL OF MY PROGRESS? No, not at all. It\u2019s common for even a 120-pound female to gain up to eight pounds of water weight after 24 hours of increased carbohydrate intake. Larger males can gain 10\u201320 pounds. Expect MASSIVE weight fluctuations after cheat day. Relax. It will disappear over the next 48 hours. Mark\u2019s experience is typical: I have been doing this now for about 10 weeks and I have weighed myself daily during the process. I put on up to 2 kg (4.4 lbs) every cheat day, return to my pre cheat weight by Wednesday at latest, and have been averaging a further 1 Kg (2.2 lbs) per week loss by the next cheat day . To date I have lost 12 kgs / 26.5 lbs. I am fairly strict during the week (protein + beans + veg and thats about it), and I do circuit training and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 3\u20134 times per week. The only variation I have from Tims guide is a whey protein shake after every hour of training . Weigh yourself before your first meal on cheat day and ignore the short- term Page 120 fluctuations, which do not reflect fat-loss or gain. Remember to take circumference measurements on your weigh-in days, as it is typical to gain some lean muscle while on this diet. The mitochondria in muscle increase your ability to oxidize fat, so we want to encourage this, but the muscle gain can keep you at the same weight for one to two weeks. Pounds can lie, but measurements don\u2019t. Some dieters needlessly fall off the train in frustration. Angel, whom we met once in earlier chapters, didn\u2019t. Why not? At the risk of sounding"

    "text": "repetitive, let me reiterate, since I know most readers will ignore this: [ Week one ] Hello all. I just wanted to share my first week with you. I have lost a total of 7 pounds.\u2026 Mondays are also the day that I take my measurements. I have lost 1 inch from each thigh, 1 inch from my waist, and 1/2 inch from my hips. I already noticed that my pants I haven\u2019t worn for a while fits perfect. This is the motivation I need to keep on going. [ Week two ] After my cheat day on Saturday, I gained 1 pound which is normal for me. The week before I gained pretty much that, but lost it. So week two, I lost that 1 pound. I didn\u2019t lose any weight on week two, but I\u2019m not discouraged. I did manage to lose in inches. I lost \u00bd an inch off my hips which is absolutely great. I lost a total of 1 inch off my thighs. Not so shabby either. So that\u2019s a total of 1.5 inches for the week. I\u2019ll take the inches. The grand total of inches lost from Day One: 5 inches total. Yippee! No exercise either. Enjoy your cheat day guilt-free. Measure the right things at the right times. CAN I USE SPICES, SALT, OR LIGHT SAUCES? WHAT CAN I USE FOR COOKING? Spices and herbs, but not cream-based sauces, are your friends. Take a trip to Whole Foods with $50 and get educated. That $50 spree will last you at least a few months. Montreal steak rub, thick salsa without sugar added, garlic salt, white truffle sea salt (combine this with tarragon on eggs), Thai chili paste (srichacha)\u2014this is just about all you need to start. For salad dressing, a few drops of a nonsugar sweetener like stevia mixed with vinegar and mustard will give you a dressing to satisfy any sweet tooth. My preference, and my go-to restaurant salad dressing, is simply balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Butter is fine, as long as the only ingredients are butter and salt. Page 121 For cooking, you can use olive oil for low heat and either grapeseed oil or macadamia oil for high-temperature cooking. \u201cComparison of Dietary Fats and Oils,\u201d from Agricultural Handbook , no. B-4, U.S. Human Nutritional Information Service, http://www.adoctorskitchen.com/about/about-fats . (Courtesy: Deborah Chud MD) Macadamia oil is the new and improved olive oil. Since several high-level bodybuilding coaches introduced me to this new kid on the block, I\u2019ve been hooked. Consider the following: \u2022 It tastes almost like butter. Extra-virgin olive oil is fine alone or on salad, but let\u2019s face it\u2014it makes scrambled eggs taste like cat vomit. \u2022 Unlike olive oil, it has a high smoking point (234\u00b0C) and is ideal for saut\u00e9eing and all manner of cooking. I now use butter from grass-fed cows, ghee, and macadamia oil exclusively for all stove-top action. \u2022 It has a long shelf life and is more stable than olive oil when exposed to light. Page 122 If you\u2019ve ever consumed olive oil from a clear container, there is a good chance that you\u2019ve downed rancid olive oil on at least one occasion. Some industry analysts estimate that more than 50% of all mass-produced olive oil is spoiled when consumed. \u2022 It is the lowest of all cooking oils in omega-6 fatty acids but high in palmitoleic acid, which isn\u2019t found in any other plant oil. Because palmitoleic acid is found in the sebum of human skin, macadamia oil can also double as a potent skin moisturizer. Not suggested with olive oil unless you want the sex appeal of a Greek salad. \u2022 The fat in macadamia oil is 80% monounsaturated, the highest percentage among cooking oils. Sources and Resources: Species Nutrition ( http://www.speciesnutrition.com )\u2014 President Dave Palumbo was the first to introduce me to macadamia oil and I get mine from his producers. CAN I DRINK ALCOHOL? WHAT TYPES OF WINE ARE BEST? On cheat days, all is fair. Have a keg by yourself if the spirit moves you. On diet days, stick to dry wines, \u201cdry\u201d being defined as less than 1.4% residual sugar. The driest red varietals are Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot, whereas the driest whites are generally Sauvignon Blanc and Albari\u00f1o. This"

    "text": "certainly doesn\u2019t stop me from enjoying my favorite big reds: Malbec from Argentina and Zinfandel from California. I have found better fat-loss results with red wine compared to white. Though there are exceptions, it is best to avoid Riesling, White Zinfandel, and Champagne. WHAT SHOULD I EAT FOR SNACKS? There should be no need, or real physical urge, to eat snacks. If you are hungry, you\u2019re not eating enough protein and legumes at each meal. This is an uber- common novice screwup. I\u2019ve been there too. Eat more. If you\u2019re eating enough and still feel the urge to snack, it\u2019s a psychological addiction, one that most often goes hand in hand with procrastination. Some of us go to the bathroom, others go to the water cooler, and others eat. I\u2019ve done all three, so I know the drill. If all else fails and you must have a snack, go for carrots, but a bag of carrots Page 123 will hit you like a donkey kick in the stomach, so don\u2019t binge. If I snack, I\u2019ll most often make a small snack\u2014200\u2013300 calories\u2014out of restaurant leftovers like Thai chicken basil with no rice. If you\u2019re really starving, just eat another slow-carb meal. It won\u2019t do any harm. If you get headaches or have other symptoms of low blood sugar, 90% of the time it will be because you are not eating enough. First-time slow-carbers are accustomed to eating small portions of calorically dense carbohydrates (think bagels or pasta), and they duplicate the portion sizes with the calorically lighter slow-carb foods, resulting in insufficient calories. Expect that you can eat two to three times as much volume, and assume that you should. Likewise, if you have trouble sleeping due to hunger, you\u2019re not eating enough. In these cases, consume a bit of protein prior to bed, which can be as simple as 1\u20132 tablespoons of almond butter (ideal) or peanut butter with no additives (the only ingredients should be peanuts and perhaps salt). Note to the ladies, for whom peanut butter seems to be like crack: the tablespoon scoop should be no more than a small mound, not half the jar balanced on a spoon. DO I REALLY HAVE TO BINGE ONCE A WEEK? It is important to spike caloric intake once per week. This causes a host of hormonal changes that improve fat-loss, from increasing cAMP and GMP to improving conversion of the T4 thyroid hormone to the more active T3. Everyone binges eventually on a diet, and it\u2019s better to schedule it ahead of time to limit the damage. The psychological benefits outweigh even the hormonal and metabolic benefits. I eat like this all the time and have for seven years. Few ways of eating (WOE) are this sustainable and beneficial. CAN YOU GET AWAY WITH ONE CHEAT MEAL PER WEEK? Most men can. Some women can\u2019t. 3 Menstruation can stop if leptin levels get too low. This happened to one reader for seven months until she returned to \u201crefeeding,\u201d as she called it (binge day), though she only did it once every two weeks. Forced overfeeding can temporarily increase circulating leptin 40%. I still suggest once per week as a default. Bumping up food intake for 12\u201324 hours, not necessarily to the point of sickness, is an important reset. If you gain too much or plateau and get nervous, eat a good high-protein meal for breakfast on your off day and then binge from lunch to dinner, which is what I now do most of the time. I don\u2019t always splurge to the point of sickness. In a response to one slow- Page 124 carber, I explained: Yes, you can eat anything you want\u2014in any quantity\u2014on Saturdays. I tend to go nuts every 1 of 4 weeks and eat so much I get nearly sick, which makes me moderate the other 3. I love Snickers, TimTams, bear claws (and all pastries), and ice cream. Enjoy. One more tip: whenever possible, eat out for your cheat meals. No matter what, throw out all bad food before the next morning. If there is bad food in your house, you will eventually eat it before your \u201coff\u201d day, also called \u201creverse Lent\u201d by some followers. WHAT ABOUT BREAKFAST?

    "text": "eggs, lentils, and spinach. I prefer lentils, straight out of the can, to black beans, and hard-boiling a dozen eggs beforehand makes this easy. Breakfast is the hardest meal for most to modify, as we\u2019re a country of toast- and cereal-eating junkies. Moving to slow carbs and protein requires a more lunchlike meal for breakfast. This is easier when you realize that breakfast can be a smaller meal when followed by a lunch three to five hours later. Try it for five days and you\u2019ll see the difference. Not only will the increased protein intake decrease water retention, resting metabolism increases about 20% if your breakfast calories are at least 30% protein. If you want a more typical breakfast, try eggs with turkey bacon (or organic normal bacon) 4 and sliced tomato. Delicious. Cottage cheese, my mother\u2019s preference, is also a fine addition. Have you ever cooked eggs with ghee (clarified butter)? Try it and thank me. Interested in why I specifically choose eggs, spinach, and lentils? For those who like to get deep in the weeds, your science fix is next. In randomized and controlled trials, eating eggs results in more fat-loss and increased basal metabolism. In one such trial, overweight women who consumed a breakfast of two eggs a day for eight weeks (at least five days per week) instead of a bagel of equal weight and caloric value lost 65% more Page 125 weight and\u2014more importantly\u2014had an 83% greater reduction in waist circumference. There were no significant differences between the plasma total-, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels of either group. Egg yolks also provide choline, which helps protect the liver and increases fat-loss as compared to a control. Choline metabolizes into betaine and offers methyl groups for methylation processes. Steven Zeisel from the University of North Carolina\u2013Chapel Hill explains: \u201cExposure to oxidative stress is a potent trigger for inflammation. Betaine is formed from choline within the mitochondria, and this oxidation contributes to mitochondrial redox status.\u201d Guess what another primary source of betaine is? Spinach. This is where credit is due: Popeye got it right. Spinach is incredible for body recomposition. The phytoecdysteroids (20HE specifically) in spinach increase human muscle tissue growth rates 20% when applied in a culture (think petri dish). Even if you\u2019re not interested in growth, it also increases glucose metabolism. Phytoecdysteroids are structurally similar to insect molting hormones\u2014finally, an affordable way to eat insect molting hormones!\u2014and both increase protein synthesis and muscular performance. Even little rats build stronger paw grips. In good news for women, the 20HE ecdysteroid tested demonstrates no androgenic properties. In other words, it won\u2019t give you a hairy chest or an Adam\u2019s apple. The Rutgers University researchers responsible for the principal study emphasize, almost as a deterrent, that one would need to eat 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of spinach per day to mimic the administration used. In testing, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not hard at all to see a visible effect with smaller amounts. I routinely eat two to three cups of spinach per day, which is less than you think, and each cup is 81 grams. Two cups, at 162 grams, is about 16% of 1 kilogram. Three cups is almost 25% of 1 kilogram. If the results of the study are dose- dependent, one might expect an increase in muscle fiber synthesis of 3% from 2 cups and 5% from 3 cups, not to mention the effect of increased carbohydrate metabolism. Compounded over time, this is significant. If the effect is not dose- dependent but rather triggered at a dose less than 1 kilogram per day, it is possible that the 20% increase could be achieved with far less than 1 kilogram. I also believe that spinach increases cAMP, but that\u2019s for the geeks to explore. Lentils, last but not least, are a rich and cheap source of protein (amino acids), isoleucine and lysine in particular. Both lysine and isoleucine, a"

There\u2019s no need to limit veggies to those I listed, but I\u2019ve found that the more variety you attempt, the more likely you are to quit, as everything from shopping to cleanup becomes more complicated. As I\u2019ve said before, this diet is not designed to be fun, even though most people end up enjoying it. It\u2019s designed to be effective. The vegetables I\u2019ve listed are those I\u2019ve found to be most tolerable when eating them again and again. Feel free to substitute whatever you want, but don\u2019t forget to include legumes for calories. One veggie that often gets unnecessarily tossed due to rule #1 (no white foods) is cauliflower. Eat all the cauliflower you like. It\u2019s great for making faux mashed potatoes. Otherwise, stick to the no-white rule. ARE CANNED FOODS ALL RIGHT? Canned foods are absolutely fine. No problem. Almost all of my vegetables are either frozen (80%) or canned (20%). I\u2019m a huge fan of canned tuna in water mixed with lentils and chopped onions. CAN I EAT WHOLE GRAINS OR STEEL-CUT OATS? No. CAN I DO THIS IF I\u2019M A LACTO-OVO VEGETARIAN? Lacto-ovo is fine. Meat isn\u2019t necessary, but it does make the job easier. Eggs and beans are sufficient to lose weight, but I would avoid most milk products. Cottage cheese is an exception. It doesn\u2019t interrupt things, and the high casein content appears to facilitate fat-loss. One reader used Yves veggie hot dogs and Instone high-protein pudding, in addition to eggs, to satisfy his protein requirements. Brown rice protein, as well as hemp or pea protein, will work if you can stomach it. If possible, I discourage consuming any refined soy products, including all soy milk and isolated soy protein supplements. See the \u201cMeatless Machine\u201d chapter for more warnings on soy and alternatives. CAN I EAT SALSA? Salsa is outstanding, especially chunky medium spicy salsa with corn, beans, etc. I can\u2019t stand egg whites by themselves, as they\u2019re too boring even for me. This is why I almost always eat whole eggs, but if you add a few spoonfuls of salsa on top of either option, it\u2019s a delicious little meal. Just don\u2019t put the salsa and lentils in the same bowl. The mixture will make you gag like a camel coughing up a hair ball. Page 127 CAN I EAT FRIED FOODS? Stir-fry is ideal for this diet, as are most cuisines (like Thai) that depend on it. Deep-frying should be avoided because of the breading and poor nutrient density for the calories. Refried beans work just fine, and more than 30 slow-carbers have lost up to one pound per day using them as a staple. Reader David C. lost 20 pounds in 30 days using almost exclusively canned refried beans. In his last update, he\u2019d lost 42 pounds and his wife had lost 36 pounds. Refried beans do, however, contain a boatload of sodium, approximately 45% of the daily allowance per cup. If you don\u2019t have hypertension, this probably won\u2019t kill you, but do your best to include other beans, or mix them together, on occasion. This will result in less water retention. Bloated ain\u2019t pretty, no matter how low your bodyfat. I love refried beans, too, but try to diversify once you have the hang of the diet. WHAT IF I\u2019M TRAVELING AND EATING IN AIRPORTS? If you\u2019re airport-hopping and cannot find a Mexican restaurant or grill, grab a bag of raw almonds or walnuts at a kiosk and commit to consuming no starch for the remainder of your travel time. There are enough calories in that single bag to give you two to three small \u201cmeals\u201d and get you through a full 12 hours. Most airports also have chicken salads (omit dressings besides olive oil or vinegar) that you can combine with the nuts. If it comes down to it, choose mild hunger instead of deviation. If you always eat on the clock, perhaps it\u2019s been a few years since you\u2019ve felt real hunger. Having followed this diet in 30+ countries, I can state without"

    "text": "exception that travel is not a legitimate excuse for breaking the rules. Speaking as a cooking-inept bachelor, and as someone who has eaten out an average of twice a day for the last five years, the slow-carb solution in restaurants is eight words: \u201cI\u2019ll just have more vegetables instead of [starch].\u201d For most places, it\u2019s a simple matter of substituting more vegetables\u2014spinach or whatever is available\u2014for the standard rice, bread, or potato that comes with Page 128 the meal. \u201cNo substitutions\u201d on the menu? No problem. Add a few more words and it\u2019s abracadabra done: \u201cI\u2019ll just have more vegetables instead of the [starch]. If I have to pay a bit extra, that\u2019s fine.\u201d If that fails, gird your loins and just order a separate veggie or legume side while omitting the starch. In total, this substituting will average out to less than $3 extra per meal, and it\u2019s often free. Consider this your nominal flat stomach tax. If you\u2019re eating out to begin with, you can afford an extra $3, so don\u2019t be penny-wise and pound-foolish. If you can\u2019t afford it, skip a latte or newspaper so you can. The most cost-effective cuisines I\u2019ve found for the Slow-Carb Diet are Thai 5 and Mexican, the latter of which leads us to the wonderfully simple example of Eric Foster and his Chipotle\u00ae Diet. Eric lost 91 pounds and went from 44% to 23.8% bodyfat in less than 10 months adhering to the following menu: BREAKFAST: One cup of coffee and an egg (scrambled or hard-boiled) [I believe he would have lost significantly more fat by adding even one extra egg each day.] LUNCH: Fajita bol (peppers, onions, steak, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, romaine lettuce) DINNER: Fajita bol (peppers, onions, steak, tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, romaine lettuce) This diet totals about 1,480 calories and 29 grams of nonfiber carbohydrates daily. Brent, another follower of the Chipotle Diet, lost 120 pounds in 11 months, bringing him from 300 to 180 pounds bodyweight. But doesn\u2019t it get boring? Eric suspected it would: I honestly thought I might get bored of the burritos after a couple months, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet. Thank God! Before I started dieting, Chipotle was my favorite place to eat. I made adjustments to the menu items to make it low-carb, and it tasted just as good as if I hadn\u2019t made any changes at all. Losing fat doesn\u2019t need to be punishment. It doesn\u2019t even need to be inconvenient. Go slow-carb for a week and you won\u2019t go back. Page 129 WHAT ABOUT FAT-LOSS DRUGS? I could recommend several hard-core thermogenics, but the potential for addiction, organ damage, and lesser-known chronic problems (sinusitis, for example) just isn\u2019t worth it. The most effective, side-effect-minimal \u201cstack\u201d I\u2019ve found is PAGG, and it\u2019s detailed in the chapter entitled \u201cThe Four Horsemen.\u201d ISN\u2019T HIGHER PROTEIN HARD ON THE KIDNEYS? WHAT IF I HAVE GOUT? First, I am not a doctor, nor do I play one on the Internet. If you have medical conditions of any type, consult a physician. Now, on to my interpretation of the data: If you don\u2019t have a serious preexisting medical condition, the amount of protein I prescribe should not hurt you. There is no compelling evidence to support the protein-hurts-your-kidneys claim. This is what Michael Eades MD calls a \u201cvampire myth\u201d because it just refuses to die, despite a lack of evidence. Gout? Gout is usually blamed on purines and therefore protein, so those diagnosed with it, like my mother, will be put on low-protein, low-legume diets. I ascribe to Gary Taubes\u2019s interpretation of the scientific literature, which indicates that fructose (and therefore sucrose, table sugar) and other factors are more likely to be causal agents of gout. Phosphoric acid in carbonated drinks is also to be avoided. My mother\u2019s uric acid levels normalized on the Slow-Carb Diet, despite much higher protein intake. She continued to take low-dose allopurinol during the diet, and the food was the only variable"

    "text": "that changed. This said, no matter what you do with your diet or self-experimentation, do not stop or modify medication without consulting a medical professional. I\u2019M HITTING A PLATEAU\u2014WHAT SHOULD I DO? The first three mistakes discussed in the next few pages (eating too late, not eating enough protein, drinking too little water) are the three most common causes. Nevertheless, the total percentage of bodyfat lost per month naturally decreases over time. The number of mitochondria in your muscle tissue largely determines your rate of sustained fat-loss. Targeted exercise, even just 20 minutes per week, will often double fat-loss that\u2019s plateaued, and should do so Page 130 for at least two to four months. The best options are covered in the \u201cAdding Muscle\u201d chapters. Common Mistakes and Misunderstandings The first three mistakes in this section cover 90%+ of stalling problems, but the rest are well worth reading. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and a few minutes of education is worth many pounds of extra fat-loss. MISTAKE #1: NOT EATING WITHIN ONE HOUR OF WAKING, PREFERABLY WITHIN 30 MINUTES This was my dad\u2019s issue and is almost always a show-stopper. Look at what happened once we addressed it: 12/27/08 Beginning weight 245 lbs. 1/30/09 End of month #1 228 lbs. 3/1/09 End of month #2 222\u00bd lbs. [Too little protein in morning for last 4 weeks\u2014 added 30 grams as a ready-to-drink Myoplex shake within 30 minutes of waking to restart fat-loss] 4/2/09 End of month #3 203\u00be lbs. 90 day weight loss = 41\u00bc lbs. The first month, his rate of loss was 17 pounds per month . The second month, when he postponed breakfast, his rate of loss dropped to 5.5 pounds per month . The third month, after consuming 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking, that rate more than tripled to 18.75 pounds per month ! These numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story, of course, as he was adding muscle at the same time, but this type of dramatic acceleration is typical. Skipping breakfast is also closely associated with overeating in the evening. Don\u2019t skip. Have no appetite in the morning? No problem. Keep it small and protein-rich, then: two to three hard-boiled eggs sprinkled with white truffle sea salt. Here\u2019s another case study, this time from JayC: Page 131 10/18/2008\u20132/14/2009: Starting weight: 260 lbs, Today\u2019s weight: 212 lbs Wow! This is the first time I\u2019ve been less than 215 since my freshman year of college! I hit a bit of a plateau after getting down to 220 on Christmas. I was eating the same, drinking the same, etc and stayed at 220! So how did I get over this plateau?? By eating more! Can you believe the awesomeness of this lifestyle? Tim had posted \u2026 to eat at least 30g of protein upon waking, and to up the water even more so. Reluctantly I enlarged my breakfast and lunch portions and BAM! Skip breakfast, forget to eat within one hour of waking, and you will fail. MISTAKE #2: NOT EATING ENOUGH PROTEIN Get at least 20 grams of protein per meal. This is absolutely most critical at breakfast. Eating at least 40% of your breakfast calories as protein will decrease carb impulses and promote a negative fat balance. Even 20% protein\u2014more than most people consume\u2014doesn\u2019t cut it. First choice: down two to three whole eggs at breakfast. Second choice: if that\u2019s impossible to stomach, add other protein-rich whole foods, such as turkey bacon, organic bacon, organic sausages, or cottage cheese. Third choice: have a 30- gram protein shake with ice and water, as my father did. The first few days you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re force-feeding yourself, and then it will all change and you\u2019ll feel incredible. Get at least 20 grams of protein per meal, no matter what. Related problem: not eating enough food. Do NOT try to restrict portions or calories. Eat until you are full, and eat as much as you like of the approved foods. If you don\u2019t, you will either downshift your metabolism or cheat between meals with banned-food snacks. Kristal wasn\u2019t losing weight and"

    "text": "was irritable on the diet. Why? Because she was neglecting legumes and focusing on a higher volume of green vegetables, resulting in insufficient calories. There is no need to count calories if you follow the rules, and one of the rules is: get plenty of legumes. Her results multiplied after making one change: I took your advice and made beans the #1 ingredient this week, and I have a lot more energy and am remarkably less cranky. The first couple weeks I made veggies #1 with a bit of beans and meat tossed in. This week it is beans, beans, beans \u2026 and I\u2019m now down 10 pounds. Whoopee! Page 132 MISTAKE #3: NOT DRINKING ENOUGH WATER To ensure optimal liver function for fat-loss, increased hydration is a must. Insufficient water intake (\u201cI just don\u2019t like drinking much water\u201d) seems to be particularly common among women. My mother plateaued in fat loss and, looking at her water intake, I insisted she add a few more glasses. She immediately started losing fat again and lost 3 pounds in the subsequent week. Make a special effort to drink more water on your cheat day , as the carbohydrate overload will pull water to your digestive tract and muscle glycogen. If you don\u2019t get enough water, headaches will be the result. MISTAKE #4: BELIEVING THAT YOU\u2019LL COOK, ESPECIALLY IF YOU\u2019RE A BACHELOR In a sentence: if you don\u2019t normally cook, get canned and frozen food for the first few weeks. Don\u2019t buy a bunch of food that requires cooking skills if you don\u2019t have them. Don\u2019t buy foods that spoil if you\u2019ve never prepared a proper meal. Unfounded optimism will just result in rotten food and frustration. Below is a telltale picture of what happens to most onions that live in my refrigerator. Jack and the onion stalk I have bags of dried lentils in my cabinet that are now six months old. Why? I\u2019m too lazy to boil and strain them. Keep it simple. Use frozen and canned stuff for at least the first two weeks. Change one habit at a time: food selection first, food preparation second. MISTAKE #5: MISTIMING WEIGHINGS WITH YOUR MENSTRUAL CYCLE (NOT A PROBLEM FOR BACHELORS) Women tend to retain much more water just before their periods. Be sure to take this into account when you start your diet and take measurements. Page 133 Ignore scale readings in the 10 days before menstruation. They\u2019re not at all a reflection of what\u2019s happening. If you are following the diet to the letter, you will lose fat. Treat your first weighing following your period (as soon as one day following is fine) as your \u201cafter\u201d measurement. Don\u2019t let short-term water fluctuations discourage you. Be aware of your menstrual timing so you don\u2019t mistakenly conclude the diet isn\u2019t working. MISTAKE #6: OVEREATING \u201cDOMINO FOODS\u201d: NUTS, CHICKPEAS (GARBANZO BEANS), HUMMUS, PEANUTS, MACADAMIAS There are certain foods that, while technically fine to eat on the diet, are prone to portion abuse. I call these \u201cdomino foods,\u201d as eating one portion often creates a domino effect of oversnacking. My fat-loss has plateaued three times due to almonds, which are easy to consume by the handful and simple to excuse as nutritious. Unfortunately, they also contain 824 calories per cup, 146 calories more than a Whopper from Burger King (678 kilocalories). A few almonds is just fine (5\u201310), but no one eats just a few almonds. Caro learned to avoid domino foods, but lost valuable time in the process, as have dozens of others: I have re-started this eating plan. I started it but wasn\u2019t following it exactly how Tim laid it all out.\u2026 I added peanuts and I was eating chickpeas and no weight loss, so I thought it was time to get real. I re-started 5 days ago and I am happy to say I have lost 5lbs in 5 days by following the plan EXACTLY as Tim says, making no adjustments or substitutes in any way, getting real and honest about what I can and can\u2019t eat. Think you\u2019ll just have one cookie or a couple of potato chips? Not if there\u2019s a bag of either in the kitchen. Self-discipline is overrated and undependable. Don\u2019t eat"

MISTAKE #7: OVERCONSUMING ARTIFICIAL (OR \u201cALL-NATURAL\u201d) SWEETENERS, INCLUDING AGAVE NECTAR Even with no calories, most artificial and natural sugar substitutes provoke increased insulin release, though aspartame (Nutrasweet \u00ae ) shows surprisingly little effect on insulin. Not that this is a free license to overconsume Nutrasweet \u00ae : it\u2019s often paired with acesulfame-K, which has a host of negative health effects. Both low-calorie and no-calorie sweeteners have been associated Page 134 with weight gain. I\u2019ve seen just about all of them stall fat-loss. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m preaching. I\u2019m a total Diet Coke whore. Can\u2019t help it. Indulging my addiction up to 16 ounces a day doesn\u2019t seem to interfere with loss. I\u2019ve found, as have other slow-carbers, that more than 16 ounces interrupts the process at least 75% of the time. \u201cAll-natural\u201d sweeteners are, based on the role of fructose in metabolic disorders, arguably worse for you than even high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). So-called \u201csugar-free\u201d health foods are full of sweeteners such as \u201cconcentrated apple and pear juices,\u201d which are two-thirds fructose, and the latest and greatest saviors are even worse. Raw agave nectar, for example, is as high as 90% fructose and shows no better antioxidant content than refined sugar or HFCS. Skip the sweeteners whenever possible. If it\u2019s really sweet, it probably spikes insulin or screws up your metabolism. Experiment with spices and extracts like cinnamon and vanilla instead. MISTAKE #7: HITTING THE GYM TOO OFTEN One female slow-carber wrote: I have been going to the gym 5x/week, 2 hours on the treadmill plus a one hour spin class 2x a week.\u2026 I have been doing this for almost three months. In the first 3 weeks I lost almost 20 pounds but since have regained about 7 pounds. I also complete a variety of exercises targeting various muscles groups (2x/week for my legs, hips, arms, etc ) The seven pounds could have been muscular gain, which is good, but she was spending more than 12 hours a week in the gym. I suspected her problem, which I\u2019d seen in others, was unsustainable overtraining and related \u201creward\u201d eating: I suspect you are overtraining and actually losing muscle, given your description. This will lower your basal metabolic rate and then cause you [to] stall with fat loss. Try the diet with no more than 2\u20133 short weight training workouts per week [if you even choose to exercise; it\u2019s not mandatory] and remember to track bodyfat % and not just weight. Doing too much will not only not help, it will reverse your progress, as it also leads to overeating, sports drinks, and other assorted self- sabotage. Page 135 Remember the MED. Less is more. Page 136 End of Chapter Notes 3. Especially if consuming less than 30% of calories as fat. 4. Residual drugs and environmental toxins are often stored in fat, so you\u2019ll want to buy the good stuff when consuming animal fat from higher up the food chain, like pork or beef. Eating larger animals from factory farms is asking for trouble. 5. I suggest avoiding curries, which can cause intestinal upset without rice. Page 137 DAMAGE CONTROL Preventing Fat Gain When You Binge Life itself is the proper binge. \u2014Julia Child Doughnuts are a normal part of a healthy, balanced diet. \u2014Brooke Smith, Krispy Kreme spokeswoman I was on a first date at Samovar Tea House in San Francisco. The incense, subdued global music, and meticulous track lighting made us feel like we were somewhere between a Buddhist-inspired Last Dragon and a Dutch coffee shop. Then, as if on cue, both of us ordered Schizandra berry tea.

This was, of course, the beginning of the end. Ah, l\u2019 amor \u2026 It is fickle and not fond of serial-killer-like behavior. But love could wait. I had other things on my mind. It was just the beginning of a 12-hour quest for fatness, and it was my second attempt. The first attempt, done with more than 10 pounds of fatty cuts of grass- fed beef, had failed. That is, I could consume only six pounds without vomiting, and I didn\u2019t gain one gram of fat. Why the hell do a quest for fatness at all, you ask? Because I wanted to prove, once and for all, that the calories-in-calories-out model was plain wrong, or at least incomplete. The easiest way I could do this was by consuming a disgusting number of calories in a short period of time and documenting the aftereffects. Page 138 This time, I had a different approach.

    "text": "minutes of lifting + walking = 190 calories. Let\u2019s call it 200. Using this math, I still consumed 6.8 times my resting metabolic rate in my 12-hour quest for fatness. So what happened? Let\u2019s look at my body fat and weight measurements, which were taken using the BodyMetrix ultrasound device, and the average of three separate weighings: Saturday, August 29, 2009 (the morning of the binge): 9.9% bodyfat at 169 pounds Monday, August 31, 2009 (48 hours later): 9.6% bodyfat at 165 pounds Page 141 WTF? Now let\u2019s look at how I did it. The Lost Art of Bingeing Sitting down for Thanksgiving dinner or butter cookies at Christmas? Sounds like a binge. That, in and of itself, doesn\u2019t need to mean horrible guilt and extra fat rolls afterward. If you plan ahead of time and understand a little science, it\u2019s possible to minimize the damage. I eat whatever I want every Saturday, and I follow specific steps to minimize fat gain during this overfeeding. In basic terms our goal is simple: to have as much of the crap ingested either go into muscle tissue or out of the body unabsorbed. I do this by focusing on three principles: PRINCIPLE #1: MINIMIZE THE RELEASE OF INSULIN, A STORAGE HORMONE. Insulin release is minimized by blunting sharp jumps in blood sugar: 1. Ensure that your first meal of the day is not a binge meal. Make it high in protein (at least 30 grams) and insoluble fiber (legumes will handle this). The protein will decrease your appetite for the remainder of the binge and prevent total self-destruction. The fiber will be important later to prevent diarrhea. In total, this can be a smallish meal of 300\u2013500 calories. 2. Consume a small quantity of fructose, fruit sugar, in grapefruit juice before the second meal, which is the first crap meal. Even small fructose dosing has an impressive near-flat-lining effect on blood glucose. 7 I could consume this at the first meal, but I prefer to combine the naringin in grapefruit juice with coffee, as it extends the effects of caffeine. 3. Use supplements that increase insulin sensitivity: AGG (part of PAGG) and PAGG (covered in the next chapter ). The example intake in this chapter is quite mild, so I dosed only twice. If I\u2019m going whole hog, I will have another PAGG dose upon waking. This reduces the amount of insulin the pancreas releases in spite of mild or severe glucose surges. Think of it as insurance. 4. Consume citric juices, whether lime juice squeezed into water, lemon juice on Page 142 food, or a beverage like the citrus kombucha I had. PRINCIPLE #2: INCREASE THE SPEED OF GASTRIC EMPTYING, OR HOW QUICKLY FOOD EXITS THE STOMACH. Bingeing is a rare circumstance where I want the food (or some of it) to pass through my gastrointestinal tract so quickly that its constituent parts aren\u2019t absorbed well. I accomplish this primarily through caffeine and yerba mate tea, which includes the additional stimulants theobromine (found in dark chocolate) and theophylline (found in green tea). I consume 100\u2013200 milligrams of caffeine, or 16 ounces of cooled yerba mate, at the most crap-laden meals. My favorite greens supplement, \u201cAthletic Greens\u201d (mentioned in the schedule) doesn\u2019t contain caffeine but will also help. Does this really work? Taking the goodies from taste buds to toilet without much storage in between? 8 More than a few people have told me it\u2019s pure science fiction. Too much information (TMI) warning: I disagree, and for good reason. Rather than debate meta-studies, I simply weighed my poo. Identical volumes of food on and off the protocol. On protocol = much more poo mass (same consistency, hence the importance of fiber) = less absorption = fewer chocolate croissants that take up residence on my abs. Simple but effective? Perhaps. Good to leave out of first-date conversation? Definitely. On to one of the cooler aspects of this whole craziness: GLUT-4. PRINCIPLE #3: ENGAGE IN BRIEF MUSCULAR CONTRACTION THROUGHOUT THE BINGE. For muscular contractions, my default options are air squats,"

    "text": "wall presses (tricep extensions against a wall), and chest pulls with an elastic band, as all three are portable and can be done without causing muscle trauma that screws up training. The latter two can be performed by anyone, even those who have difficulty walking. But why the hell would you want to do 60\u201390 seconds of funny exercises a few minutes before you eat and, ideally, again about 90 minutes afterward? Short answer: because it brings glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) to the surface of muscle cells, opening more gates for the calories to flow into. The more muscular gates we have open before insulin triggers the same GLUT-4 on the surface of fat cells, the more we can put in muscle instead of fat. Page 143 Longer answer: GLUT-4 has been studied most intensely for the last 15 years or so, as it became clear around 1995 that exercise and insulin appear to activate (translocate) GLUT-4 through different but overlapping signaling pathways. This was exciting to me, as it meant it might be possible to use exercise to beat meal- induced insulin release to the punch\u2014to preemptively flip the switch on the biological train tracks so that food (glucose) is preferentially siphoned to muscle tissue. But how much contraction is enough? It turns out, at least with animals, that much less is needed than was once thought. In one fascinating Japanese study with rats, high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIT) (20-second sprints \u00d7 14 sets, with 10 seconds of rest between sets) was compared to low-intensity prolonged exercise (LIT) (six hours of extended exercise) over eight days. The surprising result? Bolding is mine: In conclusion, the present investigation demonstrated that 8 days of HIT lasting only 280 seconds elevated both GLUT-4 content and maximal glucose transport activity in rat skeletal muscle to a level similar to that attained after LIT [\u201cLow-Intensity Training\u201d of six hours a session], which has been considered a tool to increase GLUT-4 content maximally . Compared to a control, GLUT-4 content in the muscle was increased 83% with 280 seconds of HIT vs. 91% with six hours of LIT. Now, of course, animal models don\u2019t always have a direct transfer to humans. But I wondered: what if 280 seconds was all it took? This thought produced even more questions: Do we have to get the 280 seconds all at once, or can they be spread out? Is 280 seconds really the magic number, or could even fewer seconds trigger the same effect? Is it even plausible that 60\u201390 seconds of moderate contractions could have a meaningful impact? Page 144 To attempt to answer these questions, I contacted researcher after researcher on three continents, including GLUT-4 specialists at the Muscle Biology Laboratory at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The short answer was: it did appear plausible. The most important research insight came from Dr. Gregory D. Cartee and Katsuhiko Funai: The insulin-independent effect of exercise begins to reverse minutes after exercise cessation with most or all of the increase lost within 1\u20134 hours. A much more persistent effect is improved insulin sensitivity that is often found approximately 2\u20134 hours and as long as 1\u20132 days after acute exercise. I started with 60\u2013120 seconds total of air squats and wall tricep extensions immediately prior to eating main courses. For additional effect, I later tested doing another 60\u201390 seconds approximately one and a half hours after finishing the main courses, when I expected blood glucose to be highest based on experiments with glucometers. 9 Exercises are best done in a restroom stall and not at the table. If you can\u2019t leave the table, get good at isometric (without moving) contraction of your legs. Try to look casual instead of constipated. It takes some practice. In China, I was taught a rhyming proverb: F\u00e0n h\u00f2u b\u01cei b\u00f9 z\u01d2u, n\u00e9ng hu\u00f3 d\u00e0o ji\u01d4 sh\u00ed ji\u01d4 [ ].

In all cases, if you do 60\u201390 seconds of contraction after each meal (and a bit before, ideally), you might live to see your abs. Don\u2019t forget the air squats. I aim for 30\u201350 repetitions of each of the following: Page 147 Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) is an indigenous medicinal plant of India. It is a newcomer in mainstream supplementation, usually prescribed for joint repair. In July 2009, I experimented with high-dose CQ following elbow surgery due to a staph infection. Unexpectedly, used in combination with PAGG, it seemed to have synergistic anti-obesity and anabolic (muscle growth) effects. Upon performing a second literature review of its use in Ayurvedic medicine and fracture repair, it became clear that there were implications for preventing fat gain during overfeeding. Rural China, where I continued experimentation with CQ, provided high- volume rice meals combined with sweets at mandatory sit-down meals, 3\u20135 times per day. It was the perfect fat-gaining environment. CQ preserved my abs. I saw measurable fat-loss and anabolic effects once I reached 2.4 grams (2,400 milligrams), three times per day 30 minutes prior to meals, for a total of 7.2 grams per day. Is that the magic dose? I had approximately 160 pounds (72.7 kilograms) of lean bodymass, so there might be a trigger at 45 milligrams per pound lean bodymass, or it could be an absolute effective dose regardless of bodyweight. Until long-term side-effect studies are done at these higher doses, I don\u2019t suggest exceeding 7.2 grams per day. In Beijing, after three weeks of eating like a Peking pig. For those who can afford it, I believe CQ is very effective for minimizing unwanted fat gain while overfeeding. Until more human studies are done, I don\u2019t plan on continuous use, but I will use it during 8\u201312 week growth cycles, on Page 148 \u201coff\u201d days, or after joint sprains. Kevin Rose, one of my traveling companions during our three-week trip, lamented, \u201cGlenn and I were getting fatter and fatter, while this f*cker was getting ripped. What the hell?!\u201d One friend, a serial CTO, referred to cissus quadrangularis as the \u201cmorning- after pill\u201d for diet after seeing me chase peanut butter ice cream and brownies with it. CQ works. Page 149 Why is obesity so much more common today than it was even a few decades ago? Researchers are starting to find bacterial clues that may point to an answer. There has been a profound shift in our populations of gut bacteria\u2014the little creatures that live in our digestive tracts\u2014and studies show the changes as correlated with increased fatness. There are actually 10 times more bacterial cells in your body than human cells: 100 trillion of them to 10 trillion of you. For the most part, these bugs help us, improving our immune system, providing vitamins, and preventing other harmful bacteria from infecting us. These bacteria also regulate how well we harvest energy from our food. So far, two primary strains of bacteria have been found to influence fat absorption, almost regardless of diet: Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Lean people have more Bacteroidetes and fewer Firmicutes; obese people have more Firmicutes and fewer Bacteroidetes. As obese people lose weight, the ratio of bacteria in their gut swings confidently over to more Bacteroidetes. This finding has significant enough implications for national health that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the multi-year Human Microbiome Project in late 2007. It is like a Human Genome Project for bacteria and intended to explore how some of the 40,000+ species of micro-friends (and fiends) are affecting our health and how we might modify them to help us more. This could take some time, but you don\u2019t need to wait to act. There are a few things you can do now to cultivate healthy and fat-reducing gut flora: 1 . Get off the Splenda. A 2008 study"

    "text": "at Duke University found that giving Splenda to rats significantly decreased the amount of helpful bacteria in the gut. Once again, the fake sugars turn out just as bad as, if not worse than, the real deal. 2 . Go fermented. Dr. Weston Price is famous for his studies of 12 traditional diets of near-disease-free indigenous communities spread around the globe. He found that the one common element was fermented foods, which were consumed daily. Cultural mainstays varied but included cheese, Japanese natto, kefir, kimchi (also spelled \u201ckimchee\u201d), sauerkraut, and fermented Page 150 fish. Unsweetened plain yogurt and fermented kombucha tea are two additional choices. Fermented foods contain high levels of healthy bacteria and should be viewed as a mandatory piece of your dietary puzzle. I consume five forkfuls of sauerkraut each morning before breakfast and also add kimchi to almost all home-cooked meals. 3 . Consider probiotics and prebiotics. Probiotics are bacteria. I\u2019ve used Sedona Labs iFlora probiotics both during training (to help accommodate overfeeding) and after antibiotics. Prebiotics are fermentable substrates that help bacteria grow and thrive. In this category, I\u2019ve experimented with organic inulin and fructo- oligosaccharides, commonly referred to as FOS. For a host of reasons, I prefer inulin, which I get through the Athletic Greens mentioned previously. Inulin is about 10% the sweetness of sugar, but unlike fructose, it\u2019s not insulinemic. In the whole-foods realm, garlic, leeks, and chicory are all high in inulin or FOS content. Though the research is preliminary, introducing pre- and probiotics together in the diet could have beneficial effects on allergies, aging, obesity, and a range of diseases from AIDS to type 2 diabetes. I found one potential benefit particularly fascinating, given our focus on GLUT-4: both inulin and FOS improve calcium absorption, and calcium absorption promotes the contraction-dependent GLUT-4 translocation! If the anti-obesity effects weren\u2019t enough, consider bacterial balance a crucial step in supporting your \u201csecond brain.\u201d Most of us have heard of serotonin, a wide-acting neurotransmitter that, when deficient, is intimately linked to depression. Prozac and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) act to increase the effects of serotonin. Despite the label \u201cneurotransmitter,\u201d which leads most people to visualize the brain, only 5% of serotonin is found in your head. The remaining 95% is produced in the gut, sometimes referred to as \u201cthe second brain\u201d for this reason. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 39 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota was found to significantly decrease anxiety symptoms. Probiotics (bifidobacteria is one example) have also been shown as an effective alternative treatment for depression because of their power to inhibit inflammatory molecules called cytokines, decrease oxidative stress, and correct the overgrowth of unwanted bacteria that prevents optimal nutrient absorption in the intestines.

Page 153 THE FOUR HORSEMEN OF FAT-LOSS PAGG Without garlic, I simply would not care to live. \u2014Louis Diat, First Chef de Cuisines of the New York Ritz-Carlton SUMMER 2007, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA T he smoke wisped into the air amid the sounds of summer eating: laughter, beer bottles clinking, and the undeniable sizzle of tri-tip steak on three enormous outdoor grills. All was well in Willow Glen, San Jose, where my parents were visiting me. I was at home, but they had ventured out to explore downtown Lincoln Avenue on a beautiful afternoon, which led them to La Villa Italian restaurant. My father was standing on the corner admiring the grill work when a thin homeless man sauntered up to his side. After a minute or two of silence and staring at meat and tongs, the homeless man made this opening: \u201cYou know how I lost all my weight? More than 100 pounds?\u201d My dad was 5\u20326\u2033 and almost 250 pounds at the time. Silence followed for several seconds, and my father\u2014amused by the approach and more than a bit curious\u2014finally relented: \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cGarlic. Clove after clove. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d The homeless man didn\u2019t want anything and never asked for anything. He was earnest. After sharing his advice, he just walked away. As unusual as this encounter was, I had, in fact, been looking at garlic for some time. This was just the final anecdotal push I needed to begin experimenting at much, much higher doses. The homeless man\u2019s contribution to my latest cocktail made it all come together. The final feedback from one guinea pig, a semiprofessional athlete with approximately 9% bodyfat at 200 pounds, was representative: \u201cI\u2019ve lost 6 pounds of fat in the last week. This is un-freaking-believable.\u201d Allicin, one component of garlic, appeared to be the missing fourth ingredient in a supplement stack I\u2019d been refining for two years: PAGG. Before: ECA Page 154 From 1995 to 2000, I experimented with a fat-loss cocktail that comprised ephedrine hydrochloride, caffeine, and aspirin\u2014the famed and research-proven \u201cECA\u201d stack. This was the mixture I used three times per day when on the Cyclical Ketogenic Diet to produce veins on my abdomen for the first time in my life, all in less than eight weeks. E phedrine hydrochloride: 20 mg C affeine: 200 mg A spirin: 85 mg The biochemistry was spot-on, and dozens of studies supported the effects. If E = 1, C = 1, and A = 1, the three combined have a synergistic effect of 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\u201310. 10 Sadly, the ECA stack is not a free ride. The effects are"

The withdrawal pains lead to a domino effect of stimulant use. Either people never stop taking ECA or they substitute in equally strong drugs to avoid chronic fatigue. I suspect there is an entire generation of strength and endurance athletes with ECA-induced adrenal fatigue who now depend on stimulants for normal everyday function. Some I know opt for 6\u201310 double espressos per 24 hours. Used in high doses or in high-humidity/high-heat conditions, ephedrine and ephedra have also both been associated with heart attack and death. I suffered so many sinus infections post-ECA that I visited a Stanford-trained specialist who, after reviewing a cranial MRI, asked without a second of hesitation: \u201cDo you drink much caffeine or take other stimulants?\u201d Almost all of my sinal cavities were completely blocked with compressed, dried matter. She was amazed that I was able to get out of bed in the morning. From that point onward, I removed stimulants for brief but increasing periods, as painful as it was, until I had reestablished basic adrenal function. It was clear that another fat-loss approach was needed, something more sustainable. I wanted to find a nonstimulant stack that used different pathways altogether. After: PAGG Page 155 The end result was PAGG. P olicosanol: 20\u201325 mg A lpha-lipoic acid: 100\u2013300 mg (I take 300 mg with each meal, but some people experience acid reflux symptoms with more than 100 mg) G reen tea flavanols (decaffeinated with at least 325 mg EGCG): 325 mg G arlic extract: 200 mg Daily PAGG intake is timed before meals and bed, which produces a schedule like this: Prior to breakfast: AGG Prior to lunch: AGG Prior to dinner: AGG Prior to bed: PAGG AGG is simply PAGG minus policosanol. This dosing schedule is followed six days a week. Take one day off each week and one week off every two months. This week off is critical. Let\u2019s look at our new cast of characters. POLICOSANOL Policosanol, an extract of plant waxes, often sugar cane, is the most controversial element in the PAGG stack. I originally experimented with policosanol at low and high doses to increase HDL cholesterol and decrease LDL cholesterol. Used in combination with time-release niacin, one orange before bed, and chromium polynicotinate ( not picolinate) during the four-week \u201cGeek to Freak\u201d project detailed in later chapters, I lowered my total cholesterol from 222 to 147 while almost doubling HDL. There was a pleasant side effect: an unintended but significant reduction in bodyfat. I isolated the policosanol over several weeks of further testing. The research studies are far from conclusive regarding policosanol\u2019s effects on cholesterol; most show no effect whatsoever. This could be due to not dosing policosanol before peak cholesterol production between midnight and 4:00 A.M . Regardless, the addition of policosanol (10\u201325 milligrams before bed) to the PAGG (then AGG) stack produces, in my experience and that of my guinea pigs, far superior effects for fat-loss vs. AGG alone. This was tested with three brands Page 156 and three dosages (10, 23, and 40 milligrams per day). I found 23 milligrams per day to be optimal for fat-loss, with little additional benefit from higher doses. ALPHA-LIPOIC ACID (ALA) Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger that has been proven to regenerate vitamin C and vitamin E; restore levels of intracellular glutathione, an important antioxidant that declines with age; and increase excretion of toxic heavy metals such as mercury. It was first synthesized and tested in the 1970s for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. The intravenous interventions reversed disease in 75 out of 79 subjects. Given its impressive effects, the most remarkable feature of ALA is its apparent lack of toxicity in humans. 12 It\u2019s NOAEL (No"

    "text": "Observable Adverse Effect Level) is 60 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight, which would make up to 4,091 milligrams per day safe for a 150-pound person. Our dosing will be 300\u2013900 milligrams total per day. Though lipoic acid naturally occurs in some organ meats and vegetables, including spinach and broccoli, the amounts are trace. I didn\u2019t want to consume 10 tons of liver for 30 milligrams of lipoic acid, so I began using synthetic alpha- lipoic acid in 1995. I began taking ALA for its impressive impact on glucose uptake and reduced triglyceride production. First and foremost, I wanted to increase muscular absorption of the calories (and supplements) I consumed, and ALA turned out to be the perfect force multiplier. More calories absorbed into muscle meant fewer calories deposited as fat and faster strength gains. ALA accomplishes this, in part, by recruiting GLUT-4 glucose transporters to the muscular cell membrane. This both mimics insulin and increases insulin sensitivity, and ALA is therefore being explored as an \u201cinsulino-mimetic\u201d that can be used to treat type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Not only does ALA increase glucose and nutrient absorption, but it also demonstrates triglyceride inhibition and\u2014through extrapolation\u2014fat storage. Here is an abstract from a 2009 article from the Archives of Biochemistry and Page 157 Biophysics that drives the point home: Livers from LA [lipoic acid]\u2013treated rats exhibited elevated glycogen content, suggesting dietary carbohydrates were stored as glycogen rather than becoming lipogenic substrate. In one sentence, here is why alpha-lipoic acid is kick-ass for our purposes: ALA helps you store the carbohydrates you eat in muscle or in your liver as opposed to in fat. GREEN TEA FLAVANOLS (EGCG) Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a catechin and flavanol found in green teas. It has been researched for a wide range of applications, including decreasing the risk of UV-induced skin damage, inhibiting cancer growth, and reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress (anti-aging). I tested green tea and EGCG, once again, for the underreported \u201coff-label\u201d benefits. Specifically, two related to body recomposition: \u2022 Much like ALA, EGCG increases GLUT-4 recruitment to the surface of skeletal muscle cells. Of equal interest, it inhibits GLUT-4 recruitment in fat cells . In other words, it inhibits the storage of excess carbohydrates as bodyfat and preferentially diverts them to muscle cells. \u2022 EGCG appears to increase programmed cell death (apoptosis) in mature fat cells. This means that these hard-to-kill bastards commit suicide. The ease with which people regain fat is due to a certain \u201cfat memory\u201d (the size of fat cells decreases, but not the number), which makes EGCG a fascinating candidate for preventing the horrible rebounding most dieters experience. Super cool and important. Human studies have shown some potential fat-loss with as little as a single dose of 150 milligrams of EGCG, but we will target 325 milligrams three to four times per day, as the fat-loss results seem to \u201chockey-stick\u201d\u2014go from a mild incline to a sharp rise\u2014between 900 and 1,100 milligrams per day for the 150- to 200-pound subjects I\u2019ve worked with. I suggest decaffeinated green tea extract pills as the source, unless you want to be stuck to the ceiling and feel ill. Using tea leaves and steeping cup after cup is too imprecise and too caffeinated. Page 158 If you are undergoing cancer treatment, please consult your doctor before using EGCG, as it can increase the effects of some drugs (the estrogen antagonist tamoxifen, for example) while decreasing the effects of others, 13 such as the drug Velcade \u00ae , to which it binds. If you are undergoing treatment for multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma, likewise avoid EGCG.

Allicin, if delivered in a stable form, appears to have the ability to inhibit fat regain. The reason our results were \u201cstrange\u201d relates to the \u201cstable form\u201d bit. Most research indicates that allicin should have almost zero bioavailability more than six days after extraction from garlic cloves, particularly after exposure to stomach acid. Our confounding results could be due to a combination of other organic components, most notably one precursor to allicin: S-Allyl cysteine (alliin). S-Allyl cysteine exhibits outstanding oral bioavailability, near 100% in large mammals. 14 Until further research concludes otherwise, I suggest using an aged-garlic extract (AGE) with high allicin potential that includes all constituent parts, including S-Allyl cysteine. I\u2019ve tried consuming it fresh, chomping on cloves, and it isn\u2019t kind to your digestive tract.

In particular, blood-thinning medications (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, etc.), thyroid medications, or anti-anxiety drugs like clozapine. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, do not use PAGG.

Though S-Allyl cysteine (SAC) is an easier molecule to get into your bloodstream and has been implicated in minimizing the damage of glycation and free radicals in diabetes, it would be premature to label this the single component responsible for lipid changes or fat-loss.

    "text": "analytical chemistry. He\u2019d been in mission operations and seen\u2014hell, helped produce \u2014research the public wouldn\u2019t see for decades. But spending half of his life behind a computer had taken its toll. The creeping two to four pounds per year had added up and left him weighing 230 pounds at 5\u20329\u2033. It was now a much-improved 209-pound Ray Cronise who sat with a spreadsheet in front of him and his eyes on the paused television. He still had more than 30 pounds to lose. It would take at least 18\u201324 weeks at his current rate. The spreadsheet was designed to fix this by comparing all the human activities he could isolate, each correlated to its caloric expenditure per hour for his weight. He was tired of being fat and hoped the numbers would provide a faster solution. Instead, they painted a futile picture: even if he ran a 26.2-mile marathon he would only burn around 2,600 calories, or approximately \u00be of a pound of fat. How could Phelps eat an extra 9,000 calories per day? Ray scanned his finger through the columns, jotted down a few notes, and defaulted to the calculator. It made no sense. \u201cIn order for Phelps to burn those kinds of calories above and beyond what his resting metabolic rate [RMR] was,\u201d Ray recalls, \u201ckeeping in mind that I had the calculations in front of me, and it\u2019s about 860 calories an hour at competitive Page 163 swimming rates, he would have to sustain more than 10 hours of continuous butterfly every day. Not even he can do that.\u201d So what was going on? Was Phelps misinforming journalists during his Olympic quest? Sabotaging competitors foolish enough to mimic him based on interviews? The physics didn\u2019t work. Then, in an instant, paused over the spreadsheet, after 15 years of frustration, it all became crystal clear: \u201cIt was the thermal load of the water. Water is 24 times more thermally conductive than air. Phelps spends three or four hours a day in the water.\u201d The effect was the same as pouring hot coffee into a metal cup instead of a ceramic mug; the former loses calories (heat) much faster. Ray did the math with this new variable, and, amazingly, it seemed to add up. In the six weeks that followed, from the weekend of October 27 to December 5, he would lose 28.6 pounds of fat and never regain them. The game had changed. The first 12 weeks without cold exposure vs. the second 6 weeks with cold exposure. From NASA to Everest: Correcting the Metabolism Equation It seemed too good to be true. So, as any good scientist would, Ray tried to disprove himself. In the studies and science he reviewed, what struck him most was not evidence that contradicted his conclusions, but rather the near-complete Page 164 omission of heat as a factor in fat-loss. The common equation in the literature was simple: weight loss or gain = calories-in \u2013 calories-out. \u25b3 Wt = kcal in \u2013 kcal out. This wasn\u2019t the problem. The problem was that every table for calories-out (caloric expenditure) immediately fixated on activity level. Thermodynamics\u2014 thermo dynamics\u2014had somehow been robbed of heat. In Ray\u2019s world of space shuttles and atmospheric reentry, heat was king. The laws of thermodynamics were being cited by people who didn\u2019t understand them. Take the first law as an example. In simple terms: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only change forms. The misquoters were limiting the ways ingested calories could change form. They treated exercise and storage as the only two options. In fact, the human body is an open thermodynamic system and has a number of other options. Ray\u2019s then-209-pound meat-frame could exchange energy with his environment in the form of work (exercise), heat, or matter (excretion). Running a marathon might burn 2,600 calories, but working out in an 82\u00b0F pool for four hours could burn up to an extra 4,000 calories, if one considered thermal load. How else could people like Scott Parazynski, a friend of Ray\u2019s, eat can after can of Spam and other high-fat foods? Scott was an MD and former astronaut who had"

    "text": "attempted to summit Everest twice, losing about 25 pounds on each attempt. He was successful on his second ascent. His troupe ate lard and sticks of butter to prevent excessive weight loss. The workload of the climb alone could not account for the caloric expenditure, a 5,000-calorie deficit. It was the cold. Lots of cold. So Ray began to treat himself like a human space heater. He tried everything: he drank a gallon of ice water between waking and 11 A.M .; he slept with no covers; he took midwinter \u201cshiver walks\u201d of 20\u201330 minutes with nothing but a T-shirt, earmuffs, and gloves on his upper body. He later found less painful options, but the results were undeniable. He lost almost six pounds in the first week. It Gets Better\u2014The Devil\u2019s in the Details Page 165 This was not the first time Ray had tried to lose weight. In 2006, he lost a respectable 20 pounds following the Body-for-Life (BFL) exercise and diet plan, designed by Bill Phillips. BFL performed as advertised, and Ray lost 17.8 pounds of fat in 12 weeks, for an average weekly fat-loss of 1.48 pounds. This was, by all conventional measures, a huge success. Unfortunately, in a pattern familiar to millions, he then gained it all back, plus interest. In the second experiment, however, repeating BFL with intermittent cold exposure, Ray lost 28.6 pounds in six weeks, for an average weekly fat-loss of 4.77 pounds. The addition of cold exposure alone increased fat-loss per week more than three times. This added up to 61% more total fat lost in half the time. I found Ray\u2019s results both incredible and believable. But something seemed to be missing. First of all, he had also gained more muscle with cold exposure. Losing more heat couldn\u2019t account for that. Though the muscle gain could have been accounted for by the slight inaccuracies of home-use calipers (plus or minus two pounds), I suspected there was more to the story. Second, looking at the research, the math didn\u2019t add up quite as neatly as I\u2019d hoped. It\u2019s been shown that you can burn almost four times more fat than usual with two hours of cold exposure 15 (176.5 milligrams per minute instead of 46.9 milligrams per minute). This is great, but percentage changes can be deceptive. If there are nine calories in one gram of fat, and assuming the effect lasts for the time you are in the water, then this exposure would burn an extra 139 calories, 16 or 15.5 grams of fat . 15.5 grams?! That\u2019s about 11 paper clips \u2026 for two hours of torture. Ray was losing more than three additional pounds (approximately 1,350 grams) of fat per week with cold exposure. To achieve that with water immersion alone, looking at the same studies, he\u2019d need to spend 174.2 hours per week in 50\u00b0 water. It seems unlikely that Ray spent more than 24 hours per day in water. In fact, he didn\u2019t spend two hours per day swimming in, or consuming, 50\u00b0 water. Page 166 Ray Cronise\u2019s fat-loss spreadsheet. 12 weeks without cold vs. 6 weeks with cold. Something else needed to be happening. It could have been the other thermic loads he experimented with: cold walks, sleeping without sheets, etc. Digging deeper still, I now believe that the \u201csomething else\u201d involves two players you\u2019ll hear much more about in the next few years: adiponectin and BAT. Adiponectin is a cool little hormone, secreted by fat cells, that can both increase the oxidation (\u201cburning\u201d) of fatty acids in mitochondria and increase uptake of glucose by muscle tissue. I believe adiponectin is largely to thank for Ray\u2019s muscle gain. 17 Speculation notwithstanding, the research is in its early stages, so I\u2019ll reserve adiponectin as an intellectual dessert for the geeks. My forays into its potential can be found in the online resources. BAT and my related torture experiments, on the other hand, are worth taking a closer look at.

    "text": "Not all fat is equal. There are at least two distinct types: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). WAT is what we usually think of as fat, like the marbling on a steak. A WAT cell \u2014an adipocyte\u2014is composed of a single large fat droplet with a single nucleus. BAT, in contrast, is sometimes referred to as \u201cfat-burning fat\u201d and appears to be derived from the same stem cells as muscle tissue. A BAT cell is composed of multiple droplets that are brown in color because of a much higher volume of iron-containing mitochondria. Normally associated with muscle tissue, mitochondria are best known for producing ATP and oxidizing fat in muscle tissue. BAT helps dissipate excess calories as heat. These excess calories would otherwise be stored in the aforementioned WAT and end up in your beer gut or muffin top. 18 In a nutshell: cold stimulates BAT to burn fat and glucose as heat. Cold, as well as drugs called beta-adrenergic agonists, 19 can also make BAT appear within WAT in mice and rats. In other words, cold might help you increase the amount of your \u201cfat-burning\u201d fat. This has tremendous implications. Page 168 In 1995, I began conducting experiments on myself using the powerful \u201cECA stack\u201d discussed in the last chapter. It was an effective thermogenic cocktail. So effective, in fact, that I suffered heat exhaustion three times and should have been hospitalized on two of those occasions. It doesn\u2019t matter how ripped you are if you\u2019re dead. In 1999, four years of experimentation later and much the wiser, I had eliminated the contributing factors that led to heat stroke conditions (in my case, all exercise or sun exposure at 70%+ humidity) and began to combine ECA with timed cold exposure. The outcome: in four weeks, I lost what usually took up to eight weeks with ECA alone, and I did it without the side effects. I used two different protocols, both of which worked: PROTOCOL A 1. I consumed the ECA stack 45 minutes prior to cold-bath immersion on an empty stomach. Though the metabolism of caffeine (caffeine clearance) varies from person to person, I assumed that blood concentration would peak between 60 and 90 minutes post\u2013oral consumption, which was based on the average pharmacokinetics of caffeine in white male subjects. Pharmacokinetics, usually in graph form, show the relative blood concentrations of a specific drug over time after administration. Caffeinated gum, for comparison with pills, shows peak levels at 15 minutes. Delivery mechanisms matter. 2. I placed two ten-pound bags of ice in a cold-water bath and submerged myself for a total of 20 minutes. Those 20 minutes were phased as follows: 00:00\u201310:00 minutes: Up to mid-waist, legs submerged, torso and arms not submerged. 10:00\u201315:00 minutes: Submerged up to neck with hands out of the water (sitting cross-legged then reclining makes this easier in a standard bathtub). 15:00\u201320:00 minutes: Submerged up to neck, hands underwater. Sound painful? It is. The second protocol, performed without ECA and tested separately, activated Page 169 BAT and was far easier. PROTOCOL B 1. I placed an ice pack on the back of my neck and upper trapezius area for 30 minutes, generally in the evening, when my insulin sensitivity is lower than in the morning. 20 That\u2019s it. I tested protocol A three times per week (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) and protocol B five times per week (Monday through Friday). The former caused grand mal\u2013like shivering and the latter caused no shivering. Nonetheless, looking at the bodyfat results, Protocol B appeared to be around 60% as effective as the torture baths in Protocol A. Not a bad yield, considering that no convulsing is involved. In 1999, amusingly, most researchers firmly believed that BAT, while abundant in infants, was nonexistent or negligible in adults. I was in the midst of my Guantanamo Bay baths 21 at this time, and these conclusions did not square with my experience. It wasn\u2019t until years later that better tools, most notably"

    "text": "positron-emission topography (PET), became more widespread and were used to demonstrate that BAT is most certainly present in adults, particularly in the neck and upper chest areas. That explains why the ice packs on my neck and upper trapezius worked. In the May 2009 issue of Obesity Review , a paper was published titled \u201cHave we entered the BAT renaissance?\u201d I\u2019d say the answer is yes. The abstract concludes: \u201cThese recent discoveries should revamp our effort to target the molecular development of brown adipogenesis in the treatment of obesity.\u201d Let\u2019s start with cold. It isn\u2019t fancy, but it works well. Ice Age Revisited\u2014Four Places to Start If we combine the research with data from self-trackers like Ray and his 50+ informal test subjects, there are four simple options you can experiment with for fat-loss: Page 170 1. Place an ice pack on the back of the neck or upper trapezius area for 20\u201330 minutes, preferably in the evening, when insulin sensitivity is lowest. I place a towel on the couch while writing or watching a movie and simply lean back against the ice pack. 2. Consume, as Ray did, at least 500 milliliters of ice water on an empty stomach immediately upon waking. In at least two studies, this water consumption has been shown to increase resting metabolic rate 24\u201330%, peaking at 40\u201360 minutes post-consumption, though one study demonstrated a lower effect of 4.5%. Eat breakfast 20\u201330 minutes later \u00e0 la the Slow-Carb Diet detailed in earlier chapters. 3. Take 5\u201310-minute cold showers before breakfast and/or before bed. Use hot water for 1\u20132 minutes over the entire body, then step out of water range and apply shampoo and soap to your hair and face. Turn the water to pure cold and rinse your head and face alone. Then turn around and back into the water, focusing the water on your lower neck and upper back. Maintain this position for 1\u20133 minutes as you acclimate and apply soap to all the necessary regions. Then turn around and rinse normally. Expect this to wake you up like a foghorn. 4. If you\u2019re impatient and can tolerate more, take 20-minute baths that induce shivering. See protocol A earlier in this chapter but omit the ECA. For extra thermogenic effect, consume 200\u2013450 milligrams of cayenne (I use 40,000 BTU or thereabout) 30 minutes beforehand with 10\u201320 grams of protein (a chicken breast or protein shake will do). I do not suggest consuming cayenne or capsaicin on an empty stomach. Trust me, it\u2019s a bad idea. Page 171 1. Short-term cold exposure (30 minutes) in humans leads to fatty acid release to provide fuel for heat production through shivering. This same shivering could be sufficient to recruit GLUT-4 to the surface of muscle cells, contributing to increased lean muscle gain. 2. Even at shorter durations, cold exposure with shivering could increase adiponectin levels and glucose uptake by muscle tissue. This effect could persist long after the cold exposure ends. 3. In the absence of shivering, it is still possible to capitalize on \u201cfat-burning fat\u201d through the stimulation of BAT thermogenesis. Curiously, even without shivering, there are small but unaccounted increases in lean muscle tissue when comparing underwater (superior) vs. land-based exercise. 4. Cold water improves immunity. Acute cold exposure has immunostimulating effects, and preheating with physical exercise or a warm shower can enhance this response. Increases in levels of circulating norepinephrine may account for this. 5. Not germane to fat-loss, but another reason to use cold exposure: cold showers are an effective treatment for depression. One study used showers at 68\u00b0F for two to three minutes, preceded by a five-minute gradual adaptation to make the procedure less shocking. 6. The visible results, of course: Page 172 TOOLS AND TRICKS ColPaC Gel Wrap ( www.fourhourbody.com/colpac ) These pliable wraps, used in physical therapy clinics, can be cooled quickly and applied to any body part, including the back of the neck, for BAT activation."

Men acutely exposed to cold for two hours (in a liquid-conditioned suit perfused with 10\u00b0C [50\u00b0F] water) have been observed to increase heat production by 2.6-fold and increase the oxidation rate of plasma glucose by 138%, of muscle glycogen by 109%, and of lipids by 376%.

This energy \u201cwasting\u201d is possible due to an uncoupling protein called UCP1, also known aptly as thermogenin. 19.

Rehearsing one-line explanations in my head was getting tiring, and the queue ahead of me wasn\u2019t getting shorter. I started shifting impatiently from foot to foot, like a boxer waiting for the bell, or a three-year old preparing to wee himself. Understandably, this behavior made the older midwestern couple to my right nervous. I considered telling them, \u201cJust be glad I didn\u2019t go with plan A,\u201d but I had a feeling this would make things worse. Plan A, to be clear, was awesomely stupid. Plan A was to wear a 50-pound weighted vest through security and onto the plane headed for Central America. Two days earlier, I\u2019d explained the rationale to a friend: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the gyms will have what we need, so I would at least have the vest.\u201d \u201cHmmmm \u2026 okay.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s too heavy to check as luggage, so I\u2019ll just wear it. The only downside is it might be impossible to get in the overhead bin, so I\u2019d have to wear the damn thing for the whole flight.

The 20 questions were just getting started, and the wine hadn\u2019t even arrived yet. His cousin, a close friend of mine, chimed in, as I was already plotting experiments in my mind: \u201cTrust me. He\u2019s interested. This is all he thinks about. It\u2019s weird.\u201d And that is how I first heard the name \u201cDexCom.\u201d I jotted it down and did my best to act normal. It was hard to contain my excitement. Soon thereafter, I knew all about DexCom. I called their headquarters, I called the head of marketing, I called the head of education, I spoke with the chief scientific officer, and I read about Charlie Kimball, over and over again. Charlie Kimball is a type 1 diabetic. Unlike type 2 diabetics, he needs to inject Page 176 insulin multiple times per day. He also happens to be a professional race car driver. In 2006, Charlie became the first American to ever win an F3 Euroseries race. Then, in 2007, at age 22, he went to the doctor for a small skin irritation and left the office with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Tragically, this meant he was forced to abandon racing altogether. Pricking your fingers to take blood sugar readings just isn\u2019t possible when flying around curves at 150 miles per hour. In 2008, Charlie returned to the wheel and claimed a podium finish in his first race. How? He was the first race car driver in the world to have a strange device strapped to his steering wheel: the DexCom SEVEN continuous glucose monitor (CGM). I check it like it\u2019s one of my race car gauges as I\u2019m driving around the track. It\u2019s my body\u2019s data. And it\u2019s not information overload. It\u2019s perfect. In more tangible form, it\u2019s a receiver that looks like this: Charlie has an implant in his side (as I did) that samples his blood glucose levels 22 every five seconds. These data are then transmitted to the receiver, a palm-sized device with a screen, where Charlie can see his blood glucose levels in a graph. It displays updates every five minutes, shows his ups and downs, tells him when he\u2019s falling too fast, and alerts him when he\u2019s at risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Page 177 So why on earth would I want to use this device as a nondiabetic? Why might you? What if you could tell which meals were most likely to make you fat? What if you could predict when food would hit your bloodstream and schedule exercise to optimize fat-loss or muscular gain? What if, as an endurance athlete, you could eat carbs only when you most needed them instead of guessing with a timer? The wish list went on and on. Now I just needed to check them off, one by one.

The higher the GI or GL value (the latter takes into account portion size), 23 the more a food causes blood sugar to jump. The more a food causes blood sugar to jump, in general, the fatter you will get. There are two problems with these indices. The first is that real- world meals seldom resemble laboratory meals. When\u2019s the last time you ate 100 grams of potato starch by itself? Second, the indices are one- size- fits-all. Reality isn\u2019t one-size-fits-all. If someone of baguette-eating European descent eats white bread, will his blood response be the same as someone from a pastoral bloodline that historically fed off of livestock and little starch? Not likely, as members of the former group often have higher levels of amylase enzyme, which breaks starch down into sugar. Blood sugar is a very personal thing. There are some predictable results\u2014eating doughnuts will spike blood sugar more than an equal volume of melon\u2014but what of the more subtle choices? What of the old folk remedies and bodybuilding anecdotes? Here\u2019s a short list of questions the DexCom allows us to put to the test: Does lemon or vinegar really decrease the GL of a meal? Page 178 Which lowers glucose response more, if either: protein or vegetables and fiber? Does eating fat and protein with a high-carb meal lower GL more than eating either before the meal? Does drinking water with a meal increase or decrease its GL? How I Used It and What I Learned September 23 was one of the first test days with the implant. I tried everything, as I wanted to see highs and lows. The following graphs show my data for that 24-hour period, and the downward arrows in the first graph indicate where I inputted glucometer readings. Taking the blood glucometer readings is the only pain-in-the-ass part. The SEVEN is designed to show trends and alert you when the upward or downward changes are too dramatic. To ensure that the displayed number is close to accurate, you need to calibrate with a glucometer at least twice a day. Don\u2019t want to become diabetic? Want to curb things like eating sweets, which can lead to adult-onset diabetes? Try using a glucometer for 24 hours. For each glucometer calibration, you stick a lancet (needle) into your finger and put a drop of blood on a test strip, which is read by a hand-held device (the glucometer) to display your number. Many type 1 diabetics prick their fingers more than four times per day. Page 179 I started off using a OneTouch UltraMini \u00ae glucometer, one of the most popular glucometers in the United States, but abandoned it after three weeks. It was so erratic as to be unbelievable. For each calibration, I wanted to get two readings within five points (milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]) of each other, and then input the average in the DexCom device. This would minimize the likelihood of using an error for calibration. I expected this process to take two or three jabs, but it often took more than eight needle sticks. DexCom recommends calibrating twice daily, but I tended to do it at least three times daily (meaning up to 24 needle sticks). Not fun if you have to use your hands for anything. Everything from humidity and sweat to temperature and air exposure can screw up readings. I ended up depending on the WaveSense \u00ae Jazz glucometer, the best device I could find that corrected for these variables. It brought the number of sticks per calibration from 8+ down to two to three sticks. I recommend this device. But tracking glucose levels 24/7 was just one half of the puzzle. I recorded everything I ate, and just about everything I did, in a Moleskine journal, which I then had transcribed. Here is September 23, verbatim with comments in brackets, which corresponds to the graphs on the previous page. I used the"

    "text": "as a 10-year-old birthday girl and compulsively checked the values every five minutes during meals. I ended up misattributing all over the place. My blood glucose hit 200 during sex, and I thought it was the horizontal gymnastics that caused it, not taking into account the enormous sushi plate I ate two and a half hours earlier. It was probably 80%+ due to the latter. It turned out that food and liquids took much, much longer to get to my bloodstream than one would expect. In most cases, I peaked one and a half to two and a half hours after food consumption, even with yogurt. Orange juice peaked 40 minutes after drinking. This has profound implications and made the entire experiment worth the hassle. Think you\u2019ll have a quick bite for energy 20 minutes before going to the gym? It might not be available to your muscles until an hour after the gym. The solution: eat it an hour earlier. Think that protein shake is getting to your muscles in the valuable 30-minute post-workout window? In my case, if I drank the \u201cpost-workout\u201d shake post- workout, it didn\u2019t. I needed to have it before my workout and then sit down to a large meal almost immediately after the workout. Doing it one and a half hours after the workout, as commonly suggested, just wouldn\u2019t get the goods to my muscles in time. Page 185 INCREASING FAT CONTENT IN MEALS BLUNTS JUMPS IN GLUCOSE MUCH MORE THAN LEAN PROTEIN. The more fat, and the earlier in the meal, the less the glycemic response. Eat good fat, preferably as an appetizer before the entr\u00e9e. I now eat four Brazil nuts and one tablespoon of almond butter first thing upon waking. FRUCTOSE HAS A LARGE AND VERY EXTENDED GLUCOSE-LOWERING EFFECT, BUT THIS DOESN\u2019T MEAN YOU SHOULD CONSUME IT. LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE DOES NOT ALWAYS = MORE FAT-LOSS. For one week of my testing of the SEVEN device, I drank 14 ounces of orange juice first thing in the morning as my benchmark instead of white bread or glucose. Once I\u2019d established my typical response to 14 ounces of one brand of OJ, I could isolate one variable (like vinegar or lemon juice) and measure the deviation from my usual morning response. OJ helped me to maintain much lower average glucose values throughout the day. Does this mean you should eat more fructose? Not necessarily. My fat-loss plateaued as soon as I introduced fructose (the 14 ounces of orange juice), even though it created a pleasant flat line around the 100 mg/dL mark. 27 In future tests, I would like to see if a much smaller amount of fructose in whole fruit form, probably berries, could be used to blunt glucose response without stalling fat-loss or causing fat gain. I think this would ideally be limited to a 24-hour period like a binge day and consumed 30 minutes prior to the one or two highest-GL meals, similar to how I used a small amount of OJ before croissants on September 26. It\u2019s easy to get fixated on one measurement, whether the number on a scale or the number on a glucometer. But, as Warren Buffett, the richest investor in the world, is fond of emphasizing: it\u2019s not enough to simply measure things\u2014you have to measure what matters. If your goal is fat-loss, before-and-after bodyfat percentages determine pass or fail, not glucose measurements alone. Keep your eye on the right ball. VINEGAR, COUNTER TO EXPECTATIONS, DIDN\u2019T LOWER GLYCEMIC RESPONSE. LEMON JUICE, ALSO COUNTER TO EXPECTATIONS, DID. There\u2019s a great deal of evidence for vinegar lowering the glycemic index of a meal by more than 25%. It seems as reliable as any food \u201crule\u201d could be. Both white vinegar and apple cider vinegar were used in the literature. But acetic acid is acetic acid, so any kind of table vinegar that has at least 5% acetic acid should work 28 if you consume at least 20 milliliters (1.5 tablespoons). Page 186 In my trials, neither white vinegar nor balsamic vinegar had a lowering effect on blood sugar. I even drank 3 tbsp+ of vinegar before my meals as a last- ditch attempt.

    "text": "discernible benefit. Why no effect? There are a few possible explanations, but the most likely are: I need a higher dose, or vinegar doesn\u2019t affect fructose metabolism and showcases its effects in a high-starch meal. Recall that, owing to the problems of standardizing true real-life mixed meals, I used changes in responses to OJ as a benchmark. Lemon, however, showed its merits without fail. There are anecdotes and websites galore that claim lemon juice lowers glycemic index. Neither my researchers nor I could find any controlled studies showing evidence of a GI-lowering effect for lemon, lime, or citric acid. The closest was citrate, a salt or ester of citric acid in combination with other things like insoluble calcium. In my personal trials, three tablespoons of fresh-squeezed lemon juice just prior to eating (not store-bought with preservatives and artificial additives) appeared to lower blood sugar peaks by approximately 10%. CINNAMON, EVEN IN SMALL DOSES, HAS A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON GLUCOSE LEVELS. There is ample evidence that cinnamon can be used to reduce the glycemic index of a meal up to 29%. At four grams per meal or even six grams per day, it can lower not only blood glucose but also LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Cinnamon weighs in at 2.8 grams per teaspoon, so four grams of cinnamon is about one and a half teaspoons. Cinnamon\u2019s effect on glucose levels seems partially due to the fact that it slows the rate at which food exits the stomach (gastric emptying), which means that you also feel full faster with cinnamon. I tested three species of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon ( Cinnamomum verum or zeylanicum, also referred to as \u201ctrue cinnamon\u201d), Cassia cinnamon ( Cinnamomum cassia or aromaticum ), and Saigon cinnamon ( Cinnamomum loureiroi, also known as Vietnamese cinnamon). Though Cassia is thought inferior to Ceylon or completely ineffective in some bodybuilding circles, it has lowered glycemic response in both published studies and in my experience. This is fortunate, since Cassia is what is most often found at coffee shops and restaurants if you ask for \u201ccinnamon.\u201d I found Saigon cinnamon to be most effective, with Cassia in close second place and Ceylon in much further third place. In terms of reducing glycemic response, I found the following, from largest to Page 187 smallest effect, effective: 1. Get freshly ground cinnamon or grind it yourself . If you, like me, have a bachelor-special spice rack that\u2019s three years old, toss it and get new raw materials. The polyphenols and active ingredients degrade over time and with air exposure. 2. Learn how to spot species. Unfortunately, U.S. packagers are not legally required to specify the type of cinnamon species on the label. Not sure which raw \u201ccinnamon\u201d sticks are Cassia? They will roll up from both sides, like a scroll. Ceylon will roll up from one side, as if you had rolled up a bathroom towel. Distinguishing powder is harder, as age plays a part, but Cassia tends to be a darker reddish-brown and Ceylon a lighter tan color. 3. Don\u2019t use too much. It\u2019s easy to get overambitious with cinnamon, but there are active substances that can hurt you if consumed in excess. Coumarin, as just one example, is a potent blood-thinner and some cinnamon in Europe has a warning label for this reason. Use no more than four grams per day. I use a few dashes in coffee and limit myself to two to three cups of coffee throughout the day. To reiterate, based on material bulk density reference charts, cinnamon weighs in at 0.56 grams per cubic centimeter, one cubic centimeter = 0.2 teaspoon, and so there are 2.8 grams of cinnamon per teaspoon. So four grams of cinnamon = 4 divided by 2.8, or just about one and a half teaspoons. Don\u2019t consume more per day. MORE THAN QUALITY, IT\u2019S THE SIZE AND SPEED OF MEALS THAT DETERMINED GLYCEMIC RESPONSE. Even on protein and vegetables alone, I could bump glucose as high as 150 mg/dL without much effort. Granted, I eat like a starving dog. In Whym"

    "text": "restaurant in Manhattan, one friend nicknamed me \u201cOrca\u201d after watching me nonchalantly swallow a piece of ahi-tuna the size of my fist. To him, this was unusual. To me, it was the only way I\u2019d ever eaten: fast. The easiest thing you can do to decrease glucose spikes is slow down. I had to methodically finish my plate in thirds and train myself to wait five minutes between thirds, usually with the help of iced tea and slices of lemon. It also helps to drink more water to dilute digestion (I\u2019m fantastic at this), eat smaller portions Page 188 (not so good at this), and chew more (Orca is terrible at this). All four strategies serve to decrease the amount of food that gets digested per minute, which will determine the size of your glucose arc. Two real-world examples: 1. Matt Mullenweg, lead developer of the WordPress blogging platform, lost 18 pounds with one change: chewing each mouthful of food 20 times. The exact number wasn\u2019t important. It was having a precise number that helped. Counting slowed him down and made him aware of portion size, which made him less likely to overeat. I don\u2019t have the patience for chewing like normal humans, but Matt did. 2. Argentine women are famous for being gorgeous and eating crap. In total, I\u2019ve spent about two years in Buenos Aires, and the female Argie diet appears to consist of little more than cappuccino, cookies and biscuits, a super-sweet caramel called dulce de leche , ice cream, and\u2014 for dinner\u2014meat and salad with a side of pasta. Is it just fantastic genetics? I don\u2019t think so. Several male friends have traveled with petite Argentine girlfriends, who, once in the United States or Europe, immediately put on 10\u201320 pounds. The reason? The girls themselves admitted it: increased portion size and increased speed of eating. The beautiful people of Buenos Aires might eat a wide spectrum of garbage calories, but they tend to do it in small bites and over a long period of time. Slow down and smell the roses. Make 30 minutes the minimum for a meal. FOR FASTEST FAT-LOSS, MINIMIZE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR BUMPS ABOVE 100 TO NO MORE THAN TWO PER DAY. I was able to sustain rapid fat-loss if I didn\u2019t jump above 100 mg/dL more than twice daily. Fat-loss was marginally greater when I remained under 90, but this was difficult to achieve without omitting legumes and following more of a ketogenic diet. For convenience and socializing, I prefer the slow-carb approach unless I\u2019m dieting to below 8% bodyfat. The 100-mg/dL rule excludes binge day, where all is allowed. On nonbinge days, using fructose or semistarvation to remain under 100 mg/dL is Page 189 counterproductive and considered cheating. But how to keep yourself under 100 mg/dL if you don\u2019t have an implant in your side? Just follow a handful of simple rules based on the literature and my personal tracking, in addition to the basic tenets of the Slow-Carb Diet: \u2022 Eat decent quantities of fat at each larger meal. Saturated fat is fine if meat is untreated with antibiotics and hormones. \u2022 Spend at least 30 minutes eating lunch and dinner. Breakfasts can be smaller and thus consumed more quickly. \u2022 Experiment with cinnamon and lemon juice just prior to or during meals. \u2022 Use the techniques in \u201cDamage Control\u201d for accidental and planned binges. Keep in mind that the techniques in that chapter will help you minimize damage for about 24 hours, not much more. TOOLS AND TRICKS: DexCom Seven Plus ( www.dexcom.com ) The DexCom Seven Plus is the continuou s glucose monitor I used and abused. It is an implant that gives you the approximate data of 288 fingertip blood samples per day. I found it invaluable, even as a non-diabetic. WaveSense Jazz Glucometer ( www.fourhourbody.com/jazz ) This is, by orders of magnitude, the best glucometer I found. It\u2019s small, simple to use, and incredibly consistent, as it accounts and corrects for environmental factors.

Page 192 THE LAST MILE Losing the Final 5\u201310 Pounds I saw an angel in the block of marble and I just chiseled until I set him free. \u2014Michelangelo I looked down at my pad of paper and read the first question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest mistake that drug-free \u2018natural\u2019 bodybuilders make?\u201d \u201cNatural bodybuilders?\u201d John Romano laughed. \u201cThe biggest mistake \u2018natural\u2019 bodybuilders make is thinking they\u2019re natural. Eating 20 chicken breasts a day isn\u2019t natural. The best I\u2019ll give them is \u2018over-the-counter.\u2019 \u201d And so our conversation began. It was going to be a fun interview. Romano had his finger on the pulse of physique augmentation for more than two decades as the editor in chief of Muscular Development ( MD ) magazine. MD is the one mainstream magazine that serves as an intersection between published research and experimentation in the wild world of bodybuilding. MD wasn\u2019t enough for John, so he left to push the boundaries even further on a site called RX Muscle. I reached out to him about specifics of drug- assisted and drug-free approaches for achieving sub-10% bodyfat, as he\u2019s observed thousands of guinea pigs and their results. John is a testament to his findings: he looks like he\u2019s in his thirties though he just turned 50, which he credits to infrequent HIT-style resistance training (see \u201cFrom Geek to Freak\u201d), a simple decision-free diet, and a \u201cmodicum of the right drugs.\u201d The diet he follows for fat-loss, and the one he prescribes to competitors, is also that of his business partner, whom we\u2019ll meet later: Dave \u201cJumbo\u201d Palumbo. It is an elegant and effective means for losing the last 5\u201310 pounds that seem resistant to everything else. The following menu is for a 200-pound male at 10\u201312% bodyfat, and the ounces of protein (8 ounces for a 200-pound male) should be adjusted up or down 1 ounce per 10 pounds of lean bodyweight (e.g., 7 ounces for 190 pounds, 9 ounces for 210 pounds) with a minimum per-meal intake of 4 ounces. In other words, even if you weigh 100 pounds, you will not decrease the ounces of protein below four ounces. For sizing: half a cup of almonds is about 60 almonds, and eight ounces of Page 193 lean protein is approximately the size of your fist. Here\u2019s the kicker: One of these meals has to be eaten every three hours while you\u2019re awake, and you must eat within one hour of waking and one hour of bed. Hunger is no longer the driver for food intake. Tupperware is your friend, and the clock is your drill sergeant. Skipping meals is not permitted, so purchase in bulk and prep food in advance if needed. If you weigh less than 150 pounds, use the lower end of protein intake at four ounces"

Needless to say, there is a point of diminishing returns when each additional 1% drop is more difficult than the preceding 5%. If training and diet hit a ceiling, how on earth do bodybuilders get to less than 4% subcutaneous bodyfat? In a word: drugs. Romano\u2019s pre-competition schedule on the following page assumes a well- trained 5\u20329\u2033, 200- to 220-pound bodybuilder at 10\u201312% bodyfat who gets down to 180\u2013190 pounds at 6\u20138% bodyfat before implementing the drug regimen. On contest day, he should end up at 200\u2013205 pounds at less than 4% bodyfat. Almost all of the drugs listed can have serious side effects when misused. Google \u201cAndreas Munzer autopsy\u201d to see what can happen when you make mistakes. 29 Do not try this at home. \u201cThis is really, in my opinion, the best way to prepare,\u201d Romano says, \u201cbut you need patience, and that is usually more difficult to build than the muscle. Train with super-high intensity (one body part per day, five days a week) and do cardio (30\u201340 minutes per day). Continue this regime during your \u2018pre-diet\u2019 phase. You will want to whittle your bodyfat down VERY low with a no-carb diet\u2014under 8%. You have to keep up the intensity and the cardio. This is probably going to take 10\u201312 weeks. Crazy as it sounds, you want to break down some of the muscle you just built and deplete yourself as much as possible. \u201cThen you add the juice.

But this should give you a good platform.\u201d Aesthetics are one thing, therapeutics are quite another. For a glimpse of the latter, we must learn from Nelson Vergel. Page 196 In 2001, Lee Brown, the mayor of Houston, proclaimed September 13 \u201cNelson Vergel Day.\u201d Diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1987, Nelson has dedicated his life to furthering HIV research in both prevention and treatment. For two years, he was a member of the Metabolic Disorders Committee at the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) in Washington, the largest HIV/AIDS research organization in the world. He is best known for simple interventions that have helped save many lives and improved thousands more. He describes the results of one such approach, used personally, in his own words: My CD8 cells, which may be one of the most important barometers for longevity for PWA\u2019s [people with AIDS], went from 900 to 2500 cells [per millimeter squared], and my symptoms disappeared! I never felt or looked better in my entire life, even when I was HIV-negative! Jeff Taylor, who\u2019s been HIV-positive for more than 25 years, had two collapsed lungs and just two T-cells remaining when he began a similar treatment. Six weeks later he had 300 T-cells. It saved his life. The mystery treatment wasn\u2019t a new antiviral cocktail. In fact, it wasn\u2019t new at all. It was anabolic steroids. Specifically, Nelson used testosterone cypionate and Deca-Durabolin\u00ae (nandrolone decanoate), and Jeff used Anavar\u00ae (oxandrolone). This is confusing to most people. Aren\u2019t steroids supposed to kill you, or, at the very least, cause cancer or liver failure? How can it be that the very same oxandrolone Jeff used \u201chas been found to be one of the most cost-effective and least-toxic therapies to date\u201d for treating male burn victims? After doing an exhaustive review of the literature and interviewing scientists and actual users, Bryant Gumbel, the host of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel , concluded the following on June 21, 2005: Page 197 As frequently evidenced by officials nationwide, Americans, when drugs are concerned, rarely choose logic when they can opt for hysteria. Case in point: the recent hoopla over steroids. In light of the media excess, the public pronouncements, and the wailing in Washington, one would assume that the scientific evidence establishing the health risk of steroids is overwhelming. But it\u2019s not. On the contrary, when it comes to steroid use among adult males, the evidence reveals virtually no fire, despite all the smoke. This summation, needless to say, ran counter to expectations. Did you know that birth control drugs are technically steroids? This is also true of the cortisone shots that future baseball Hall of Famer Curt Schilling used in the 2004 World Series, the same anti-inflammatory injections Andre Agassi used during his final U.S. Open. Steroids represent an incredibly broad and important class of hormone, and there are hundreds of variations in plants, fungi, and animals. If you eliminated steroids from your body, you would die.

    "text": "most often used in the media to refer to anabolic- androgenic steroids (AAS), more commonly called anabolic steroids. These compounds are variations of the hormone testosterone or are intended to mimic the effects of testosterone. Nandrolone, for example, is testosterone that has been chemically modified to minimize its conversion to estrogen or DHT, the latter change making it less androgenic \u2014that is, it will have less of an amplifying effect on secondary male characteristics like hair growth (or loss from the scalp) or the thickening of the vocal chords. Below is a side-by-side comparison of normal testosterone and the most commercially popular form of nandrolone, Deca-Durabolin\u00ae (\u201cDeca\u201d), which Nelson used. Deca is also one AAS that Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens are alleged to have used. Page 198 I have legally used low-dose anabolic steroids and other growth agents under medical supervision both before and after joint surgeries. Multiple MDs reviewed blood tests every two to four weeks to ensure there were no complications. These drugs are specifically designed to increase protein synthesis; in the case of my surgeries, it was moderated and a proper use of the appropriate tools. Do I encourage recreational or cosmetic use without medical supervision or without legal prescriptions? No. Anabolic steroids are Class III controlled substances, and you can receive up to three years\u2019 imprisonment for possession and up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment if convicted of trafficking or intent to traffic. Do I think that healthy children, adolescents, or women should use powerful male hormones? Absolutely not. Do I think that athletes should be disqualified if they break the rules of their sport? Most definitely. But the science shouldn\u2019t be distorted. These are valuable drugs with real applications. Here is a small sample of well-documented side effects, provided by the National Institutes of Health: \u2022 Swelling of the eyes, face, lips, tongue, or throat \u2022 Wheezing or difficulty breathing \u2022 Fast heartbeat \u2022 Fast breathing \u2022 Cold, clammy skin \u2022 Ringing in the ears Page 199 \u2022 Loss of hearing \u2022 Bloody vomit \u2022 Bright red blood in stools This list should scare you. It should scare you because these aren\u2019t side effects of anabolic steroids. These are common side effects of aspirin. Some drugs are safer than others, but almost anything will kill you at a high enough dose. It\u2019s the dose that makes the poison. Never forget this, and don\u2019t confuse the effects of moderate use with those of outright abuse. It\u2019s the difference between a single 8\u201312-week cycle of low-dose injectable testosterone for surgery, on the one hand, and uncycled megadoses of the oral steroid Anadrol-50\u00ae for elite bodybuilding, on the other. It\u2019s the difference between a baby aspirin (75\u201385 milligrams) and half a bottle of aspirin. It\u2019s the difference between having a glass of wine before bed and drinking bottles until you wake up in the intensive care unit. Sensationalism is more common than good science, and the two are not the same.

In the process, it will also teach women how to build the perfect ass and lose dramatic amounts of fat. For maximum strength and sex appeal in minimal time, the posterior chain is where you should focus. The Bet \u201cWe have a bet going.\u201d Tracy Reifkind walked into work that evening expecting a normal shift. But six of her female coworkers had reached critical mass and created a betting pool. Each had put in $100, and the $600 would go to whoever lost the highest percentage bodyfat in 12 weeks. Tracy was lucky number seven, upping the ante to $700. It was good timing. Tracy had been a chubby kid when kids weren\u2019t chubby. She\u2019d continued to gain throughout life and ended up weighing 245 pounds at age 41. She had resigned herself to a dismal fate: she would never be able to enjoy certain basics, like wearing a tank top. That was just the hand she\u2019d been dealt. But her weight was creating health problems. She\u2019d become a gourmet cook with the dream of visiting Italy, and that trip\u2014almost within reach\u2014was now jeopardized by her obesity. She was experiencing gastrointestinal problems that made it impossible to travel. Page 204 \u201cEverything wrong with me had to do with the fact that I was fat. Every day, I felt like I was dodging a bullet. I didn\u2019t want to go to the doctor because I didn\u2019t want to find out I was prediabetic or that I had heart disease. I just liked eating and wasn\u2019t ready to stop. I, of course, knew what I had to do. But that bet, that event, gave me the reason and the timing.\u201d Tracy responded well to challenges. She was somehow confident that she would win. The real question was: how? The answer came, most unexpectedly, from strong men. Michelle Obama\u2019s Arms Tracy was dumbstruck as she looked at the fitting room mirror in San Jose. She pulled up the new pair of jeans and turned around. Then she turned around again. No matter how many times she spun, the image didn\u2019t compute. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s me?!\u201d She saw arms she\u2019d never seen before. She also had her tank top. Tracy Reifkind had lost more than 100 pounds (45 pounds of fat in the first 12 weeks) and won her bet. But the numbers alone don\u2019t do her physique justice: this mom of two from a two-income family looked 10 years younger at 129.6 pounds. The secret wasn\u2019t marathon aerobics sessions, nor was it severe caloric Page 205 restriction. It was the Russian kettlebell swing, twice a week for an average of 15\u201320 minutes. Her peak session length was 35 minutes. She was introduced to kettlebells by her husband, Mark Reifkind, a former national team coach in powerlifting who also competed against Kurt Thomas in Olympic gymnastics. \u201cEvery woman wants Michelle Obama\u2019s arms.

If you could only do one movement for the rest of your life, do the kettlebell swing.\u201d Body by design: Tracy removed the curves she didn\u2019t want and added the curves she did. Notice the kettlebells, which look like cannonballs with handles, lined up against the wall. I agree with Tracy 100%, though the path that led me to the swing was quite different. In 1999, I made thrice-weekly pilgrimages from Princeton to Philadelphia where I trained at a gym called Maxercise. For the 45-minute workout that Page 206 justified the trip, I was commuting more than two hours. Steve Maxwell, the owner of Maxercise, was a six-time Pan- American gold medalist in Brazilian jiu- jitsu (two world championships came later) and held a master\u2019s degree in exercise science. His clients ranged from the FBI and Secret Service to the Phillies and the Dodgers. His singular focus was on measurable results. If something didn\u2019t work, it didn\u2019t last long with Maxwell. I first met kettlebells on a frigid winter evening in Maxercise\u2019s second-floor torture chamber. They were generally reserved for fighters and aspiring strong men. Most of the high-velocity kettlebell movements like \u201cthe snatch,\u201d 1 considered standard for training programs, didn\u2019t combine well with my injured shoulders. I abandoned kettlebells after two sessions. It wasn\u2019t until six years later that I realized how simple kettlebells could be. One move: the swing. From Jiu-Jitsu to New Zealand: The Kettlebell Swing Long before I met Tracy, I met \u201cThe Kiwi\u201d in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In early 2006, he happened to be taking a private Spanish lesson in the same caf\u00e9 where I was finishing the manuscript for The 4-Hour Workweek , and we quickly became close friends. He had competed in elite-level rugby in New Zealand but was equally proud, I soon learned, of applying his BSE in exercise physiology to perfecting the female posterior. He told me the story over a bottle of Catena Malbec. His obsession started when he saw a professional samba dancer in Brazil balance tequila shots on top of each butt cheek in a dance club. Lamenting the lack of similar scenes in his own country, he set off on a mission to isolate the best exercises for creating buttocks worthy of tequila shots. By 2000, he had refined his approach to a science. In four weeks, he took his then-girlfriend, an ethnic Chinese with a surfboardlike profile, to being voted one of the top 10 sexiest girls out of 39,000 students at the University of Auckland. Total time: four weeks. Other female students constantly asked her how she\u2019d lifted her glutes so high up her hamstrings. If The Kiwi could have answered for her, he would have said, \u201cAdd reps and weights to the swings.\u201d In 2005, my interest in kettlebells reinvigorated, I returned to the United States from Argentina and purchased one 53-pound kettlebell. I did nothing Page 207 more than one set of 75 swings one hour after a light, protein-rich breakfast, twice a week on Mondays and Fridays. In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t complete 75 consecutive repetitions, so I did multiple sets with 60 seconds between until I totaled 75. Total swing time for the entire week was 10\u201320 minutes. I wasn\u2019t trying to balance tequila shots on my butt cheeks. I wanted abs. In six weeks, I was at my lowest bodyfat percentage since 1999. 2005: Swing minimalism. My weekly training schedule was so light as to be laughable by conventional standards. I also took 10\u201320-minute ice baths (two bags of ice bought at a gas station) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. DAY 1 (MONDAY) \u2022 High-rep kettlebell (53 pounds) swings to at least 75 reps (ultimately, I got to 150+ reps in a single set) \u2022 Slow myotatic crunch ( next chapter ) with max weight x 10\u201315 slow reps DAY 2 (WEDNESDAY) I alternated these two exercises for a total of 3 sets \u00d7 5 reps for each. I took two minutes between all sets and therefore had at least four minutes between the same exercise (e.g.,"

It didn\u2019t matter. The training volume needed for head- turning changes was lower than even I thought possible. Though I added in a few extras for other reasons, the king of exercises\u2014the two-arm kettlebell swing\u2014is all you need for dramatic changes. Here are a few guidelines (more later): \u2022 Stand with your feet 6\u201312 inches outside of shoulder width on either side, each foot pointed outward about 30 degrees. If toes pointed straight ahead were 12:00 on a clock face, your left foot would point at 10:00 or 11:00, and your right would point at 1:00 or 2:00. \u2022 Keep your shoulders pulled back (retracted) and down to avoid rounding your back. \u2022 The lowering movement (backswing) is a sitting-back-on-a-chair movement, not a squatting-down movement. \u2022 Do not let your shoulders go in front of your knees at any point. \u2022 Imagine pinching a penny between your butt cheeks when you pop your hips forward. This should be a forceful pop, and it should be impossible to contract your ass more. If your dog\u2019s head gets in the way, it should be lights out for Fido.

The Minimal Effective Dose\u2014 How to Lose 3% Bodyfat in One Hour a Month Fleur B. didn\u2019t have as much weight to lose as Tracy. Fleur was, like many people, simply unable to lose those last few pounds of extra fat, no matter how hard she tried. She\u2019d hit the wall. Running a few miles three times per week had no effect: \u201cFor the amount of exercise I do, the results should be much better.\u201d She was, however, against crash dieting and wanted to keep the curves she loved. How to cross the last mile of fat-loss? Fleur was a major breadoholic by culture (European) and a workaholic by training (journalist). I purposefully set the expectation that it would be difficult and that she would need to commit to exercising militant self-control for the first two weeks until her cravings disappeared. This way, she would be doubly encouraged when it didn\u2019t prove hard after the first 72 hours. Setting the expectation that things will be easy results in disappointment and quitting at the Page 210 smallest hiccup. If you prepare yourself for massive challenges and no such challenges crop up, it will be a pleasant surprise. This encourages you to be even more aggressive with changes. Remember: body recomposition depends more on behavioral modification (reread \u201cFrom Photos to Fear\u201d if needed) than on memorizing the right list of instructions. I proposed a four-week test focusing on the swing and minuscule dietary changes, which Fleur agreed to: 1. She switched her breakfast to a high-protein meal (at least 30% protein) \u00e0 la the Slow-Carb Diet. Her favorite: spinach, black beans, and egg whites (one- third of a carton of Eggology liquid egg whites) with cayenne pepper flakes. 2. Three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), she performed a simple sequence of three exercises prior to breakfast, all of which are illustrated in the next few pages: One set: 20 two-legged glute activation raises from the floor One set: 15 flying dogs, one set each side One set: 50 kettlebell swings (For you: start with a weight that allows you to do 20"

The easiest way to learn the swing is based on a method developed by Zar Horton: Stand with the kettlebell directly between the middle of your feet. Bend down and do deadlifts (head up, eyes straight ahead), first slowly, then in a \u201ctouch-and- Page 212 go\u201d fashion, picking up the kettlebell explosively as soon as it touches the ground. It is critical that you touch the same spot on the ground every time. This spot between your insteps is point A. I strongly suggest doing this facing a wall with your toes about six inches from the wall. This will force you to keep your head up and use the proper deadlift motion: hinging at the hip and sitting back, instead of squatting down. Keep any bending at the ankle minimal or nonexistent. Repeat the above touch-and-go deadlift, but use point B: place the kettlebell on the floor between your feet but this time further back, with the front of the kettlebell aligned just behind your heels. You must return the kettlebell to exactly this spot every time: Now when you come up and explosively pop your hips forward (think \u201cviolent hips\u201d), the angled rise of the kettlebell will give it a pendulum-like swing. Now place the kettlebell back at point A and follow the pictures of Marie on the previous page. Pick the kettlebell up off the floor, start a small swing by first \u201csitting back\u201d with the hips and then popping forward, and make the movement larger while maintaining your balance. The entire time, focus on getting the kettlebell back to point C, which is in the air behind the hamstrings (back of legs) and tucked right up under the buttocks, as seen in picture 5. That\u2019s it: you are doing the two-handed kettlebell swing. Page 213 Two-legged glute activation raises. Pull the toes up as you drive off of your heels. Flying dog with right arm and left leg extension. Alternate with left arm and right leg. Fleur\u2019s resulting numbers demonstrate the difference between scale weight\u2014a blunt instrument that tells you little\u2014and bodyfat percentage or tape measure. Do not neglect to include at least one of the latter two in your measurement tool kit. The 75 minutes of exercise had a number of important effects on Fleur\u2019s physique that went beyond fat-loss and ass building. Most important, it fixed her kyphosis (from the Greek kyphos , meaning \u201chump\u201d), a postural problem common to millions of computer users. From desk work and muscular imbalance, she had a shoulders-forward, concave-chest slouch before beginning the program. Five weeks later, she stood and walked with shoulders back, which created the perception of both a smaller rib cage and larger breasts. Good posture is hot. Here is Fleur\u2019s first e-mail to me, edited for length: Hey, Page 214 I\u2019m doing well \u2026 much better than I could have imagined.\u2026 There are [a] few things I\u2019ve noticed about the diet that I think you\u2019ll be very interested to learn.

It\u2019s maybe also because I\u2019m eating more, and more regularly. Just eating breakfast early in the morning instead of coffee and toast or a pastry at 11am has made a huge difference. I\u2019m thinking about fueling my body, not restricting it. I ate really well all last week and then assigned Sunday as my \u201cfree day.\u201d I ate pancakes and an omelet at the IHOP (very healthy). Then I felt like crap. All the cheese made me want to throw up.

Critical (M)Ass: The Kiwi\u2019s Complete A/B Workout For those who want a more extended ass program, here is The Kiwi\u2019s complete sequence. He advocates three to four circuits of these exercises, in the order provided. I believe the MED is two circuits and will deliver 80\u201390% of the benefits for most women and men. Men can use these sequences to develop stronger hip drive, which translates to better performance in almost all sports and power lifts. If you try this but start to miss workouts or postpone them, revert to the basic swings twice per week, as I do, which will still guarantee faster progress than most exercise programs. To mimic The Kiwi, perform A on Monday and B on Friday, and glute activation raises (seen earlier) are performed before each. Workout A All exercises, except for kettlebell swings, are performed for 10 repetitions using a 13-Repetition Max 2 (RM) weight. 1. Heavy dumbbell front squat to press (ass to heels)\u2014squeeze glutes at bottom for one second before rising 2. One-arm, one-leg DB row 3. Walking lunges with sprinter knee raise 4. Wide-grip push-ups 3 5. Two-arm kettlebell swings \u00d7 20\u201325 Repeat sequence 2\u20134 times. Workout B 1. One-leg Romanian Deadlift (RDL) 4 (10\u201312 reps each side) 2. Chin-up (four-second negative lowering portion only) \u00d7 10 or until you cannot control descent 5 3. One-leg hamstring curls on a Swiss ball\u20146\u201312 reps each leg Page 216 4. Plank for abs (and gluteus medius on sides) \u2192 Progression: start with 30 seconds front, 30 seconds each side, working up to 90 seconds maximum 5. Reverse hyper \u00d7 15\u201325 Repeat sequence 2\u20134 times.

TOOLS AND TRICKS Kettlebells ( www.fourhourbody.com/kettlebells ) Most men should start with a 20-kg (44 lb) or 24-kg (53 lb) kettlebell and most women should start with a 16- kg (35 lb) or 20-kg (44 lb) kettlebell. I suggest using a T-handle (see this page ) to determine your 20-rep swing weight before spending too much. Tracy never hit a fat-loss plateau.

She scheduled one cheat meal per week, most often on Friday night, which was also date night with the husband. Her diet is otherwise the epitome of simplicity: eat the same meals each day, at least five days per week. She refers to her meal plans as \u201cthe luxury of no choice\u201d: \u201cEspecially if you have 50\u2013100 pounds or more to lose, you have enough stress. You won\u2019t be able to stop thinking about how overweight you are, but you can stop thinking about what to eat.\u201d Her advice and observations should sound familiar: Two pounds per week isn\u2019t the limit. \u201cIf you have 80\u2013100 pounds to lose and aren\u2019t losing five pounds per week for at least the first few weeks, you are doing something wrong.\u201d Avoid domino foods: \u201cIf I liked to eat a cookie here, a piece of candy Page 217 there, I could fit sweets into my daily menu from a caloric standpoint, but my sweet tooth has no \u2018shut-off sensor.\u2019 Once I get started, I have a hard time stopping. I can consume 1,200\u20131,800 calories of dense sweets in no time flat. If I start to eat sweets, I know I will not be happy until I get my fill. And \u2018my fill\u2019 is way more full than the average person. It is not a serving of cookies or cake, it\u2019s an entire bag of cookies, or half a cake \u2026 and that\u2019s no joke. This I know. So I don\u2019t try and fool myself into thinking I can eat just one cookie or just two pieces of candy. If I could eat two pieces of bread, as another example, I\u2019d be fine, but I have to have four, so I don\u2019t eat it at all.\u201d Organic food\u2014good but not necessary: \u201cI lost 100 pounds never eating a single organic vegetable. Do it if you can, but if you can\u2019t\u2014for budgetary reasons or otherwise\u2014don\u2019t create more stress because you can\u2019t go to the farmers\u2019 market or a high-class grocery store. Eat the right foods and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Vegetables and protein: \u201cThe only reason I\u2019ll never be fat again is because I start each meal with a base of vegetables that taste good. Then I add my protein. I don\u2019t discriminate against protein, though my favorites are lamb, pork, chicken, and beef. I\u2019ll eat an entire cow before I eat powdered protein. Blech.\u201d Page 218 Kettlebells are not inexpensive. If you can\u2019t afford them, or to determine your ideal swing weight (what you can currently do for 20 good repetitions) before ordering kettlebells, there is a fantastically inexpensive option: the \u201cT-handle.\u201d Rumored to be one of the core tools of dominant Hungarian hammer throwers, this simple device is also known as the Hungarian Core Blaster (HCB). I have 20 kettlebells of various sizes but still prize my T-handle, as it can be disassembled for travel and packed flat at a weight of less than five pounds. In addition to swings, it can be used for deadlifts, two-arm bent rows, curls, reverse curls, and more. For $10, five minutes of shopping, and less than five minutes of assembly, you have an entire gym. Here\u2019s what it looks like: Just head to any hardware store or Home Depot and head to the plumbing aisle: \u2022 One \u00be\u2033 diameter \u00d7 12\u2033 long pipe nipple for the vertical shaft. A \u201cpipe nipple\u201d is, somewhat paradoxically, a short pipe threaded on both ends with male pipe thread. 7 \u2022 Two \u00be\u2033 diameter \u00d7 4\u2033 long pipe nipples for the handles. Electrical or duct tape can later be used to cover the outside threads, but I just wear leather gloves when training with the T-handle. \u2022 One \u00be\u2033 diameter pipe \u201cT\u201d fitting to connect the above items. \u2022 One \u00be\u2033 floor flange to keep the plates from falling off as you swing. An optional but suggested addition: \u2022 One spring clamp (I use an Irwin Quick-Grip 1\u2033) to keep plates from Page 219 drifting up at the top of the swing. Do not swing the weights above sternum height. Last but not least, replace the T-handle every six months. Tossing a bunch of plates on your cat or through a wall won\u2019t win you IQ points when both are preventable for the cost of a T-shirt. Special thanks to Dave Draper for"

    "text": "introducing me to this beautifully simple device. Page 220 What do Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Elle Macpherson have in common? The number 0.7 and the letters WHR. If you measured the waist and hip circumference of these three women, you\u2019d find that their waists are 7/10 the size of their hips. This makes their waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) 0.7, and this ratio in females appears to be hardwired into the male brain as a sign of fertility and therefore attractiveness. The wider your waist is, the higher this ratio goes toward the apple-shaped 1.0, which correlates in scientific studies with decreased estrogen levels, increased disease risk, increased birth complications, and lower fertility rates. Professor Devendra Singh at the University of Texas\u2013Austin has studied the pear-shaped 0.7 body and found it popping up in 2,500-year-old stone Venus sculptures across Europe and Asia, in all Miss America winners from 1923 to 1987 (0.69 to 0.72), in Playboy centerfolds from 1955 to 1965 and 1976 to 1990 (0.68 to 0.71), and across different cultures\u2014from Indonesians and Indian laborers to African Americans and Caucasians. The good news? If you were born with wide hips, no worries. Working toward a more slender waist has been shown to have a greater effect on attractiveness than reducing hip size. If your WHR is high, dropping it even a little bit will increase your power (health and hotness) to attract a male partner. For men, your magic numbers are 0.8\u20130.9 for WHR and 0.6 for the waist-to- shoulder ratio (WSR). Broad shoulders can be built. Perhaps the simplest tool for fine-tuning WHR in both sexes? No surprise: the kettlebell swing. Page 221 End of Chapter Notes 1. Even better, kettlebells are weighed in Russian \u201cpoods.\u201d 2. This means you are doing 10 reps with a weight that would allow you to complete 13 but not 14 reps. Approximate is fine, but you shouldn\u2019t have more than 3 or so reps left in the tank when you finish the set. 3. Men can use any hand position. Wide-grip is recommended for women who want to avoid tricep (back of the upper arm) growth. If you can\u2019t do ten push-ups on the floor, they can be performed with the hands on a low bench, or\u2014if still impossible\u2014against a table or wall. 4. Effectively the same as the 2SDL described in \u201cPre-Hab.\u201d 5. Expect severe soreness the day after the first two workouts. 6. One of them is my favorite indirect abdominal/core exercise (one-arm, one-leg row), and two are excellent for travel for both genders (one-leg hamstring curls and reverse hyper on Swiss ball). 7. If you are shorter than 5\u20325\u2033, a 10\u2033 or even 8\u2033 pipe nipple can be used to avoid dangerous brushing of the ground.

    "text": "Path Less Traveled I\u2019ve never had visible abs. Even when my bodyfat was low enough to show veins everywhere else, my frontal six-pack\u2014the rectus abdominus\u2014showed almost no separation. Damnation. Low bodyfat was necessary but not enough. Page 223 I performed conventional ab exercises for more than a decade with no discernible benefit, somehow convinced it was just a matter of time. Albert Einstein would call this insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Things changed only when I began testing basic assumptions in 2009. It took a week to arrive at a reductionist program of two exercises. I performed these exercises just twice a week on Mondays and Fridays after kettlebell swings. In a matter of three weeks, I had my six-pack. There is just one more prerequisite for visible abs: follow a diet that allows sustained low bodyfat of 12% or less. I suggest the Slow-Carb Diet, as it has the highest compliance rate I\u2019ve ever observed, but other viable options include a ketogenic diet (especially the Cyclical Ketogenic Diet) and intermittent fasting (IF). The latter will be covered in later chapters. Drew Baye after more than six months of no direct abdominal exercises. It goes to show how diet is often a determining factor. (Photo: Mike Moran) Movement #1: The Myotatic Crunch I began my analysis by looking for common attributes in exercises that hadn\u2019t worked. The shared feature of all the dominant exercises, in particular the floor crunch, is that they used no more than half of the full range of motion (ROM) of Page 224 the abdominals. If you were to imagine yourself sitting in a chair, the prescribed exercises all took you toward your knees (crunch, floor sit-up) or brought your knees toward your chest with a straight back (roman chair, reverse crunch). I decided to ignore that fetal range of motion altogether for eight weeks and focus on the stretched position achieved with full back extension. The result was the myotatic crunch, so named because it leverages the fully stretched position and the resultant reflex (myotatic reflex or stretch reflex) for a stronger contraction than I had been able to achieve otherwise. It didn\u2019t take eight weeks to see a difference. It took three. Since this exercise is also effective for recruiting the transverse abdominis (explained next), if you have to choose one exercise, choose this one. If a BOSU ball is not available, use a small Swiss ball (45\u201355 centimeters in diameter) or a pile of firm cushions. Using a BOSU or Swiss ball, ensure your ass is close to the floor, usually no more than 6\u2033 off the ground. Then follow these steps: 1. Start with arms stretched overhead as high as possible (I overlap my extended hands as if in a diving position). Keep your arms behind or next to your ears for the entire exercise. 2. Lower under control for 4 seconds until your fingers touch the floor, the entire time attempting to extend your hands further away from the ball. 3. Pause at the bottom for 2 seconds, aiming for maximum elongation (picture 3). 4. Rise under control and pause in the upper, fully contracted position for 2 seconds. The arms should not pass perpendicular with the ground. 5. Repeat for a total of 10 repetitions. Once you can complete 10 repetitions, add weight to your hands. I tend to use books of different sizes. If female, I don\u2019t suggest exceeding 10 pounds in added weight (see \u201cHourglass\u201d sidebar on this page ). Page 225 Movement #2: The Cat Vomit Exercise This exercise is dedicated to my ex-girlfriend. I want only the best for you, Angelina Jolie. Unless you purchase a corset at the same time, doing crunches will not pull your abdomen in. The muscle fibers of the six-pack (rectus abdominis) run vertically. The muscle you want to target instead is called the transverse abdominis (TVA), the deepest of the six main abdominal muscles, which is composed of fibers that run horizontally like a belt. The TVA is nicknamed the \u201ccorset muscle,\u201d and if"

    "text": "your abs have ever ached from laughing or coughing, you\u2019ve felt it working. Page 226 Unfortunately, laughing repeatedly in the gym will get you a straitjacket or a plate to the head, so here is the alternative: 1. Get on all fours and keep your gaze focused either directly under your head or slightly in front of you. Don\u2019t arch your back or strain your neck. 2. Forcefully exhale from your mouth until all air is fully expelled. Your abs should be contracted from this forceful exhale. Full exhalation is necessary to contract the transverse abdominals, and you\u2019ll use gravity to provide resistance. 3. Hold your breath and pull your belly button upward toward your spine as hard as you can for a target of 8\u201312 seconds. 4. Inhale fully through the nose after the 8\u201312 second hold. 5. Take one breath cycle of rest (exhale slowly out the mouth, inhale slowly through the nose), then repeat the above for a total of 10 repetitions. There you have it: the myotatic crunch and the cat vomit exercise. Heave, groan, and be merry. Page 227 Square obliques are unattractive on women, and using common progressive resistance exercises can create them. Fortunately, the myotatic crunch and cat vomit exercises, as described, are not such exercises. Loss of the feminine hourglass shape is sad and leaves some women looking bloated under clothing, even when they have low bodyfat. Not good. If you want additional abdominal exercises as a woman, stick with timed planks instead, which also strengthen the gluteus medius on the hip. Just as The Kiwi in the last chapter prescribed, start with 30 seconds on the front, then 30 seconds on each side, working up to 90 seconds maximum per set. One set per angle per workout is all that\u2019s needed. Last but not least, to avoid the small potbelly look so common among women, even fitness competitors, fix your pelvic tilt with hip flexor stretches. The following can be performed once a day for 30 seconds on each side. Before kettlebells is perfect, as it will also help with hip extension. Page 228 Even if you ignore the two exercises in this chapter, don\u2019t rely on the plain- vanilla crunch. It\u2019s utterly ineffective. Here\u2019s how it stacks up against other exercises when rectus abdominis activation is measured with electrodes and an EMG (electromyography machine). Google each exercise if curious. The traditional crunch is given a value of 100%. Bicycle crunch 248% Captain\u2019s chair 212% Exercise ball 139% Vertical leg crunch 129% Torso track 127% Long arm crunch 119% Reverse crunch 109% Crunch with heel push 107% Ab roller 105% Hover 100% Traditional crunch 100% Exercise tubing pull 92% Ab rocker 21% TIPS AND TRICKS BOSU Balance Trainer ( www.fourhourbody.com/bosu ) The BOSU looks like half of a Swiss ball with a flat plastic base attached to the underside. I use it for myotatic crunches and the torture twists featured in \u201cEffortless Superhuman.\u201d GoFit Stability Ball ( www.fourhourbody.com/stability ) If preferred to the BOSU, this 55-cm \u201cstability\u201d ball (usually referred to as a \u201cSwiss\u201d ball) can be used. It\u2019s less than half the cost of a BOSU, but I found such balls hard to store Page 229 in the home and less versatile.

    "text": "It was all planned. Progressive reduction. You see, most of the conventional wisdom about muscular growth is just dead wrong. Prelude: On Being Genetically Screwed I come from a family of lightly muscled males. The only exception is a dramatic bubble butt on my mom\u2019s side. Not a bad look if you\u2019re a Brazilian woman. In August 2009, to confirm the obvious, I mailed DNA samples to the Gist Sports Profile laboratory in Australia for testing of the ACTN3 gene, which codes proteins for fast-twitch muscle fiber. Fast-twitch muscle fibers have the greatest potential for growth, whereas slow-twitch fibers have the least potential. Just a smidge of helpful science: muscle fibers are composed of myofibrils, which are in turn composed of two filaments\u2014actin (thin filaments) and myosin (thick filaments)\u2014that slide over each other to cause muscles to contract, a literal shortening of the muscle. Actin filaments, which are necessary to this process, are stabilized by actin-binding proteins. One actin-binding protein called alpha-actinin 3 (ACTN3) is expressed only in fast-twitch muscle fiber, the crown jewel of shot-putters and bodybuilders worldwide. Page 231 It turns out that both of my chromosomes (one from Mammy and one from Pappy Ferriss) contain the R577X variant of the ACTN3 gene, a mutation that results in a complete deficiency of our most desired ACTN3. This variant, amusingly called a \u201cnonsense allele,\u201d is found in more than a billion humans worldwide. Sad Christmas. The cover letter from Gist Sports began with the following headline, which, in good humor, lacks an exclamation point: Congratulations Tim Ferriss. Your Genetic Advantage: Endurance Sports. This is a diplomatic way of telling me (1) I\u2019m not likely to win an Olympic gold medal in sprinting, and (2) I am not genetically pre-programmed to gain a lot of muscular mass. I hadn\u2019t won the fast-twitch lottery for bodybuilding, 8 and chances are that you haven\u2019t either. Looking at family photos, this result wasn\u2019t surprising. What is surprising is how well you can override genetics. I have gained more than 20 pounds of fat-free mass within four weeks on at least four occasions, the most recent in 2005. Two of these experiments were done in 1995 and 1996 at Princeton University, where Matt Brzycki, then Coordinator of Health Fitness, Strength and Conditioning, nicknamed me \u201cGrowth.\u201d This chapter details the exact methods I used in 2005 to gain 34 pounds of fat- free mass in 28 days. Page 232 For the ladies not interested in becoming the Hulk, if you follow a Slow-Carb Diet and reduce rest periods between exercises to 30 seconds, this exact workout protocol can help you lose 10\u201320 pounds of fat in the same 28-day time span. Before-and-After I weighed 152 pounds throughout high school, but after training in tango in Buenos Aires in 2005, I had withered to 146 pounds. I remedied the situation with a 28-day schedule based primarily on the work of Arthur Jones, Mike Mentzer, and Ken Hutchins. Before-and-after measurements, including underwater hydrostatic weighings, were taken by Dr. Peggy Plato at the Human Performance Laboratory at San Jose State University. Though this ridiculous experiment might seem unhealthy, I tracked blood variables and dropped my total cholesterol count from 222 to 147 without the use of statins 9 (see pre-bed supplementation). Here are the results: Age: 27 (in 2005) Weight before: 146 lbs Weight after: 177 lbs (183 lbs three days later) Bodyfat percentage before: 16.72% Bodyfat percentage after: 12.23% Total muscle gained: 34 lbs Total fat-loss: 3 lbs Time elapsed: 4 weeks To put 34 pounds in perspective, the following image is exactly one pound of lean grass-fed beef sirloin next to my fist.

Lo, eat your heart out) Page 234 Oh, and I forgot to mention, all of this was done with two 30-minute workouts per week, for a total of 4 hours of gym time . How Did I Do It? First, I followed a simple supplement regimen: Page 235 Morning: NO-Xplode 11 (2 scoops), Slo-Niacin (or timed-release niacinamide, 500 mg) Each meal: ChromeMate (chromium polynicotinate, not picolinate, 200 mcg), alpha-lipoic acid (200 mg) Pre-workout: BodyQUICK (2 capsules 30 mins. prior) Post-workout: Micellean (30 g micellar casein protein) Prior to bed: policosanol (23 mg), ChromeMate (200 mcg), alpha-lipoic acid (200 mg), Slo-Niacin (500 mg) No anabolics were used. From a training standpoint, there were four basic principles that made it happen, all of which will be expanded upon in the next chapter : 1. PERFORM ONE-SET-TO-FAILURE FOR EACH EXERCISE. Follow Arthur Jones\u2019s general recommendation of one-set-to-failure (i.e., reaching the point where you can no longer move the weight) for 80\u2013120 seconds of total time under tension per exercise. Take at least three minutes of rest between exercises. 2. USE A 5/5 REP CADENCE. Perform every repetition with a 5/5 cadence (five seconds up, five seconds down) to eliminate momentum and ensure constant load. 3. FOCUS ON 2\u201310 EXERCISES PER WORKOUT, NO MORE. Focus on 2\u201310 exercises per workout (including at least one multi-joint exercise for pressing, pulling, and leg movements). I chose to exercise my entire body each workout to elicit a heightened hormonal response (testosterone, growth hormone, IGF-1, etc.). Here is the sequence I used during this experiment (\u201c+\u201d = superset, which means no rest between exercises): \u2022 Pullover + Yates\u2019s bent row \u2022 Shoulder-width leg press 12 \u2022 Pec-deck + weighted dips \u2022 Leg curl \u2022 Reverse thick-bar curl (purchase cut 2\u2033 piping from Home Depot if needed, which you can then slide plates onto) Page 236 \u2022 Seated calf raises \u2022 Manual neck resistance \u2022 Machine crunches All of these exercises can be found at www.fourhourbody.com/geek-to-freak . 4. INCREASE RECOVERY TIME ALONG WITH SIZE. This is described at length in the next chapter , which describes the most reductionist and refined approach to overriding stubborn genetics: Occam\u2019s Protocol. Occam\u2019s Protocol is what I suggest almost all trainees start with for mass gains. Think gaining 34 pounds in 28 days is impossible? I might have, too, if it weren\u2019t for bumping into the curious case of Casey Viator. The \u201cColorado Experiment\u201d was conducted in May 1973 at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. It was designed by Arthur Jones and supervised by Dr. Elliott Plese, Director of the Exercise Physiology Lab in the Department of Physical Education. It was intended to be a brutal example of minimalist training. Casey Viator\u2019s results, produced from three workouts per week, were otherworldly: Increase in bodyweight: 45.28 lbs. Loss of bodyfat: 17.93 lbs. Muscular gain: 63.21 lbs. Page 237 Photos by Inge Cook, provided courtesy of Ellington Darden PhD That same month, Arthur Jones followed in Viator\u2019s footsteps and gained 15 pounds in 22 days. How did they do it in workouts that averaged just 33.6 minutes each? First, negative-only sets were often used, wherein the weight was raised with the legs using a lever and then lowered with the target muscle, allowing heavier weights than could otherwise be lifted. Second, exercises were paired into supersets to prefatigue a muscle (e.g., quadriceps with leg extension) prior to taking it to failure with a compound movement (e.g., squats). Third, Casey ate 6\u20138 meals per day like it was his job. That\u2019s not a metaphor. He had a cash incentive per pound of muscle gained. It was his job. Here is one of Casey\u2019s actual"

Both the Denver Broncos and Dick Butkus of the Chicago Bears visited Fort Collins to observe the fast-paced training, which is hard to appreciate unless you attempt it. Though far from easy, the basic workout template is simple. The following was sent to me by Casey Viator himself: Leg press \u00d7 20 reps Leg extension \u00d7 20 reps Squats \u00d7 20 reps (increase weight 20 lbs once you hit 20, then work back up to 20) (Two-minute rest) Leg curl \u00d7 12 reps Calf raises 3 \u00d7 15 Behind-neck pull-down \u00d7 10 Row \u00d7 10 Page 239 Behind-neck pull-down \u00d7 10 (Two-minute rest) Lateral raise \u00d7 8 Press behind-the-neck \u00d7 10 (Two-minute rest) Curl \u00d7 8 Underhand chin plus weight for reps (Two-minute rest) Tricep extension \u00d7 22 Dips \u00d7 22 13 The Colorado Experiment has, no surprise, faced incredible criticism. For starters, the study was neither published nor repeated. Casey has been accused of simply regaining weight he\u2019d lost following a car accident. Not one to speculate, I asked Casey directly about all of this and more. His answer: he dieted down for two months as instructed pre-experiment (this had always been transparent) and lost approximately 20 pounds of muscle mass. Casey has no financial interest in the Colorado Experiment more than 20 years later, so I assume this to be the truth. Ditto with his response to questions about anabolic steroid use: There has been a lot of questions regarding steroid use. Many people claimed that I loaded up for this experiment. I can honestly say that there was no use of steroids during this study, which is a very important point. I was closely monitored in a closed-door environment. Believe me, I would have done anything to have gained that weight, but I knew my rebound potential and I also knew I would make remarkable gains even before the study began. The equation is undeniable: 63.21 pounds\u201320 pounds still = 43.21 pounds gained in 28 days above baseline. Even if drugs were used, these gains reflect a phenomenal training effect. If you believe that steroids guarantee a gain of 30+ pounds in four weeks, you should look at clinical studies and real-world users. It just isn\u2019t the case. The real significance of the Colorado Experiment is two-fold, despite the fact that Casey is clearly a genetic mutant. First, it is physiologically possible to synthesize enough protein to produce 63.21 pounds of lean mass in 28 days. This shows that one counterargument Page 240 (\u201cyou\u2019d have to eat 20,000 calories a day!\u201d) is flawed. 14 This is true even if drugs were involved. There are mechanisms involved that the simplistic caloric argument doesn\u2019t account for. Second, the workout logs show that the amount of stimulus needed to produce these gains (remember that Arthur also gained 15 pounds in 3 weeks) was less than two hours per week. To quote Casey: \u201cI was very proud of the results that took place in Colorado and feel that this study has contributed to the awareness of how much time is wasted in most individuals\u2019 workouts.\u201d More than four hours per month of gym time is not necessary to reach your target weight in record time. Flip the growth switch and go home. What to do with your newfound time? That\u2019s easy."

    "text": "Focus on eating. Page 241 How much protein should you eat per meal? There\u2019s a popular (mis)belief that the human body can\u2019t absorb more than 30 grams of protein per meal. The science refutes this. Researchers in France have found that eating protein all at once can be just as well absorbed as spreading it out over your day. A group of 26-year-old women were given either 80% of their protein for the day at one meal or spread over multiple meals. After two weeks, there was no difference between the subject and control groups in terms of nitrogen balance, whole-body protein turnover, whole-body protein synthesis, or protein breakdown. In both subjects and controls, the amount of protein given was 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of fat-free mass per day. This means that, for a 26-year-old, 125-pound woman, eating 77 g 15 of protein in one meal had the same effects as spreading it out. The experiment was then repeated in older subjects, with whom, it turns out, eating protein all at once can actually lead to better protein retention. Giving elderly women 80% of their protein for the day at one meal over a period of two weeks led to almost 20% more synthesis and retention of protein compared to dividing it into smaller doses. So it appears that daily total protein is more important than per-meal protein. It\u2019s also important to remember that food weight does not equal protein weight. For example, if you weigh near-fat-free chicken breasts on a food scale and the total is 140 grams, it does not mean you\u2019re getting even close to 140 grams of protein. In fact, 140 grams contains about 43 grams of protein, less than one-third the total weight. People forget the heaviest piece: water. A good rule of thumb for daily intake, and a safe range based on the literature, is 0.8\u20132.5 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. For muscular gain, I suggest at least 1.25 grams per pound of current lean bodyweight, which means you subtract your bodyfat first. Here are a few examples: 100 lbs of lean mass = 125 grams of protein 110 lbs = 137.5 g 120 lbs = 150 g 130 lbs = 162.5 g 140 lbs = 175 g Page 242 150 lbs = 187.5 g 160 lbs = 200 g 170 lbs = 212.5 g 180 lbs = 225 g 190 lbs = 237.5 g 200 lbs = 250 g Not gaining muscle? Track your protein over one day. Then eat more.

Page 244 OCCAM\u2019S PROTOCOL I A Minimalist Approach to Mass It is vain to do with more what can be done with less. \u2014William of Occam (c. 1288\u20131348), \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d 100 FEET OFFSHORE, MALIBU, CALIFORNIA I was sitting on my surfboard 20 feet to the side of Neil Strauss, bestselling author of The Game . The afternoon sun was shimmering off the rolling sets of blue water, and he was catching wave after wave. Me, not so much. In between bouts of falling into whitewash like an injured seal, I mentioned that my next book was a hacker\u2019s guide to the human body. Might he be interested in gaining 10 or more pounds of muscle in four weeks? He stopped catching waves and turned to look at me: \u201cCount me in. I\u2019m so in.\u201d Neil weighed 124 pounds. The work started four months later. I was now watching Neil take 45 minutes to eat a small seafood entree at the Hawaiian-themed Paradise Cove restaurant. His fork would pause a few inches in front of his mouth as thoughts occurred to him, and there it would remain for minutes at a time. It drove me nuts. This glacial pace was apparently a vast improvement. To prove this, he had e- mailed me an excerpt of an interview he did with Julian Casablancas of the rock band The Strokes: Julian: You\u2019re a very slow eater. You have had a ham sandwich in your hand for like 45 minutes. Neil: That\u2019s true. I know. Julian: You just have a little bite. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re just chewing it, or does the food dissolve in your mouth? Given no choice, I resorted to feeding Neil spoonfuls of brown rice in between sentences. Neighboring tables looked on in confusion. The enormous colorful umbrellas sticking out of our coconut-shell \u201cCocoladas\u201d made the scene even more questionable. It was very bromantic. Page 245 Neil had been punished as a kid for taking \u201cNeil bites\u201d and keeping his parents waiting at the dinner table. Not eager to be sent to his room, he developed the habit of stuffing all of the food in his mouth, which often backfired with projectile vomiting across the table. Gross. Pausing to sip his Cocolada, Neil said he felt sick. I told him to keep eating. He looked down at his plate and repeated: \u201cDude, I really feel sick.\u201d So I once again repeated: \u201cNo, you just don\u2019t want to eat. Take bigger bites. You\u2019ll adapt.\u201d Then, just to be safe, I inched out of vomit range. Despite the bickering couple routine, I had complete faith: we were, after all, only 48 hours into the protocol. Then things began to work as planned. Five days later, I received the following text message from Neil: Gotta tell you: you\u2019re turning me into a ravenous food-devouring machine. And, mentally and physically, between the healthy food, exercise, and Malibu air and surf, I feel frigging great. The text was prompted by a turning point. He had demolished an entire plate of steak in half the time as his girlfriend\u2019s entire family, proceeded to eat what remained of her food, and then continued to vacuum up the steak leftovers. Tapeworm? No, his digestive enzymes and other internal flora had just adapted to the increased food intake, and now he was primed for processing. Ten days into the protocol, Neil\u2019s sex drive was so high that it was almost a problem. His girlfriend had to push him away as if he were a single-minded 19- year-old. High sex drive is, of course, a quality problem, and"

    "text": "it\u2019s a by-product of vastly increased protein synthesis. In just over four weeks, Neil, who\u2019d never been able to gain weight, gained 10 pounds of muscle and grew from 125 to 135 pounds, a near 10% increase in total body mass. The Bike-Shed Effect Page 246 The goal of this chapter is to reduce everything to the absolute minimum. Before we get started, we need to discuss the \u201cbike-shed\u201d effect, originally described by C. Northcote Parkinson. To illustrate this phenomenon, let\u2019s compare a conversation about building a nuclear power plant with building a bike shed. Most people rightly assume that they know nothing about something as complex as a nuclear power plant and so won\u2019t voice an opinion. Most people wrongly assume, however, that they know something about building a bike shed and will argue until the cows come home about every detail down to paint color. Everyone you meet (every male, at least) will have a strong opinion about how you should train and eat. For the next two to four weeks, cultivate selective ignorance and refuse to have bike-shed discussions with others. Friends, foes, colleagues, and well-intentioned folks of all stripes will offer distracting and counterproductive additions and alternatives. Nod, thank them kindly, and step away to do what you\u2019ve planned. Nothing more and nothing different. Complicate to Profit, Minimize to Grow To earn a fortune in the diet and exercise industries, there is a dictum: complicate to profit. To grow, however, you need to simplify. The objective of the minimalist routine I\u2019ll describe is: 1. Not to make you a professional athlete. 2. Not to make you as strong as possible, though strength will increase and the gains will surpass most protocols. Strength is the sole focus of \u201cEffortless Superhuman.\u201d Here is our singular objective: to apply the MED necessary to trigger muscular growth mechanisms, and then channel food preferentially into muscle tissue during overfeeding. There is one condition: we must do both as safely as possible. The safety issue is particularly important to understand when considering exercises. Don\u2019t get me wrong; all movements are safe when performed properly. This includes backflips on one leg, break-dancing headspins, and the much- Page 247 vaunted snatch. 16 The problem with such movements, and dozens of others, is that a minor mistake can cause serious, often permanent, injuries. These injuries are underreported because: (1) those affected don\u2019t want to be ostracized from communities that view the moves as gospel, and (2) cognitive dissonance prevents them from condemning a move they\u2019ve advocated for a long time. So what is used to explain the injury? \u201cI/he/she just didn\u2019t do it right.\u201d There is underreporting of diet failures (raw food as one example) for similar reasons. In fairness, can you learn to do snatches safely? Sure. But if there are safer substitutes that provide 80% or more of the benefits, I will suggest those substitutes instead. In more than 15 years of resistance training, I have never been injured following the protocols I will describe here. I suggest adopting one rule of Dr. Ken Leistner, an NFL strength consultant I had the painful pleasure of training with in 1996: the goal of strength training is to reduce injury potential first, and to increase performance second. Occam\u2019s Protocol Recall that coach Matt Brzycki at Princeton nicknamed me \u201cGrowth.\u201d He has written more than 400 articles on strength and conditioning and dealt with everyone from SWAT teams to NFL teams. What made me different from trainees who didn\u2019t grow? I used hyper-abbreviated training to compensate for mediocre recuperative abilities. It was the self-control to do less. \u201cOccam\u2019s Protocol\u201d is a variation of the consolidation routine used by the late Mike Mentzer, who won the heavyweight class of the Mr. Olympia competition in 1979. It is possible to get huge with less than 30 minutes of gym time per week. The following A and B workouts are alternated, whether"

    "text": "you choose the machine or free weight option. The exercises should be performed for one set each and no more. The objective is to fail, to reach the point where you can no longer move the weight, at seven or more repetitions at a 5/5 cadence (five seconds up and five seconds down). The leg press is to be performed for 10 or more repetitions at the same cadence. The only exceptions to the cadence rule are the abdominal exercises and kettlebell swing, which are described in earlier chapters. Page 248 The mechanisms of growth we want to stimulate are both local (muscular, neural) and systemic (hormonal). The longer time under tension (TUT) for the lower body will elicit a greater full-body growth hormone response while also stimulating the formation of new capillaries, which will improve nutrient delivery. Each workout consists of just two primary lifts. WORKOUT A: THE MACHINE OPTION 1. Close-grip supinated 17 (palms facing you) pull-down \u00d7 7 reps (5/5 count) 2. Machine shoulder press \u00d7 7 reps (5/5 count) (Optional: Abdominal exercises from \u201cSix-Minute Abs\u201d) It is critical to record seating settings on all machine exercises. If there are four holes showing in the sliding seat adjustment, for example, note this in your notebook or iPhone. Even one to two inches of difference in starting position can change the leverage and create the illusion of strength gain or loss, especially with pressing movements. Record it all and standardize the movement. Page 249 There are a million and one ways to perform exercises. To keep things simple\u2014and to keep you safe\u2014I will make one recommendation: use the \u201c locked position \u201d to protect your shoulders in all weight-bearing exercises, whether the kettlebell swing, the bench press, the deadlift, or other. Asking for trouble. From Marie\u2019s normal shoulder position, I can easily pull her shoulder forward like a dislocation. Her entire upper body is unstable in both pictures. Page 250 The \u201clocked position.\u201d Marie has pulled her shoulder blades back and pushed them down toward her hips 1\u20132 inches. Notice how you can see her shoulder strap in these photos but not in the first set. There is a slight arch in the back, and if you extend your arms in front of you, the elbows should be closer to nipple height than collarbone height. Marie is now stable, and I can even lift her off of the ground with one arm. WORKOUT B: THE MACHINE OPTION 1. Slight incline/decline bench press \u00d7 7 (5/5 count) 2. Leg press \u00d7 10 (5/5 count) (Optional: Kettlebell or T-bar swings from \u201cBuilding the Perfect Posterior\u201d \u00d7 50) 3. Stationary bike \u00d7 3 minutes at 85+ rpm (to minimize subsequent leg soreness) Slight Incline/Decline Bench Press (Shown Here: Hammer Machine) If you\u2019ll injure your shoulders on any exercise, it will be the flat bench press. For this reason, I suggest a slight (less than 20-degree) incline or decline when possible. For stubborn chest development, Dorian Yates suggests the slight decline. If only flat machines are available, a phone book or thick rolled towel behind the lower back will create a slight decline angle. Page 251 To prevent unnecessary shoulder strain, set the pins in the machine (or seat adjustment) so that your knuckles are one fist width above your chest at the bottom of the movement. I also suggest a one-second pause at the bottom of the movement without touching the weight stack, which will aid in chest development and further reduce risk. Leg Press For most trainees, I suggest the above routine incorporating machines. WORKOUT A: FREE WEIGHT OPTION Free weights can be used if you prefer them, or if you travel often and need standardized equipment that is the same around the world: 1. Yates row with EZ bar (ideal) or barbell \u00d7 7 (5/5 count) (see pictures in the sidebar later this chapter) 2. Shoulder-width barbell overhead press \u00d7 7 repetitions (5/5 cadence) (Optional: Abdominal exercises from \u201cSix-Minute Abs\u201d) Barbell Overhead Press The elbows are kept in front of the shoulders and do Page 252"

The split stance prevents excessive arching of the back, but a shoulder-width parallel stance can also be used. WORKOUT B: FREE WEIGHT OPTION 1. Slight incline bench press with shoulder-width grip \u00d7 7 (5/5 count) (If no Power Rack 18 is available, use dumbbells, but you\u2019ll often run into problems with adding weight in small increments.) 2. Squat \u00d7 10 (5/5 count) (Optional: Kettlebell or T-bar swings from \u201cBuilding the Perfect Posterior\u201d \u00d7 50) 3. Stationary bike \u00d7 3 minutes (to minimize subsequent leg soreness) Squat (Shown Below with Smith Machine) The feet, slightly wider than shoulder width, are placed a foot ahead of your hips. Initiate the movement by breaking at the hips (imagine pouring water out the front of your pelvis) and sitting backward, descending to where your thighs are parallel with the ground. Look up at approximately 45 degrees throughout the movement and do not pause at the top or the bottom. Page 253 Rules to Lift By 1. If you complete the minimal target number of reps for all exercises (excluding abs and kettlebell swing), increase the weight the next workout at least 10 pounds for that exercise. If the additional 10 pounds feels easy after two to three reps, stop, wait five minutes, increase the weight an additional 5 to 10 pounds, then do your single set to failure. 2. Do not just drop the weight when you hit failure. Attempt to move it, millimeter by millimeter, and then hold it at the limit for five seconds. Only after that should you slowly (take five to ten seconds) lower the weight. The biggest mistake novice trainees make is underestimating the severity of complete failure. \u201cFailure\u201d is not dropping the weight after your last moderately strenuous rep. It is pushing like you have a gun to your head. To quote the ever poetic Arthur Jones: \u201cIf you\u2019ve never vomited from doing a set of barbell curls, then you\u2019ve never experienced outright hard work.\u201d If you feel like you could do another set of the same exercise a minute later, you didn\u2019t reach failure as we are defining it. Remember that the last repetition, the point of failure, is the rep that matters. The rest of the repetitions are just a warm-up for that moment. 3. Do not pause at the top or bottom of any movements (except the bench press, as noted), and take three minutes of rest between all exercises. Time three minutes exactly with a wall clock or a stopwatch. Keep rest periods standardized so you don\u2019t mistake rest changes for strength changes. 4. The weight and repetitions used will change as you progress, but all other variables need to be identical from one workout to the next: rep speed, exercise form, and rest intervals. This is a laboratory experiment. To accurately gauge progress and tweak as needed, you must ensure that you control your variables. Page 254 That\u2019s it. The temptation to add exercises will be enormous. Don\u2019t do it. If anything, if you\u2019ve never been able to gain mass, you might choose to do less. That\u2019s what we did with Neil. His program and progress over four weeks looked like this: WORKOUT A Pull-down: 8 reps \u00d7 80 lbs \u2192 8 reps \u00d7 110 lbs Machine shoulder press: 8 reps \u00d7 30 lbs \u2192 5 reps \u00d7 60 lbs WORKOUT B Seated dips: 6 reps \u00d7 140 lbs \u2192 6 reps \u00d7 170 lbs Seated leg press: 11 reps \u00d7 140 lbs \u2192 12 reps \u00d7 190 lbs Occam\u2019s Protocol is enough to stimulate a massive growth response. Remember our tanning analogy in the beginning of this book? Forget working harder for a minute and realize that biology isn\u2019t about blunt force. Don\u2019t add a damn thing. Occam\u2019s Frequency Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything that I thought it could be. \u2014Peter Gibbons, Office Space The frequency of the A and B Occam workouts is based on a simple premise: you must increase recovery time along with size.

    "text": "can often increase muscle mass well over 100% before reaching a genetic ceiling, but your recovery abilities might only improve 20\u201330% through enzymatic and immune system upregulation (increased plasma glutamine production, etc.). Put in simple terms: it takes nongrowing repair systems longer to repair a 20- pound muscle than its 10-pound predecessor. The bigger and stronger you get, the less often you will go to the gym. Looking at the hypothetical two months below printed from freeprint ablecalendar.net , we see that sessions are not scheduled on set days (e.g., Page 255 Monday and Friday), but are instead spaced apart by set numbers of rest days, which increase over time. In 1996, while at the Capital University of Business and Economics in Beijing, I grew to 197 pounds and was easily the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. No supplements whatsoever were used, as none could be found. I hit a whole-food ceiling at 6,000 calories per day, as more made me ill, but I was able to resolve all progress plateaus with additional rest days, eventually ending the bulking cycle after four months at 12 days between identical workouts. Two sample months GETTING STARTED Page 256 Step 1: Take at least seven days off of all training that causes significant muscular damage. No bodyweight resistance training or weight training allowed. Step 2: Begin Occam\u2019s Protocol with two days between A and B workouts. After two of both the A and B workouts, increase the rest days between workouts to three days. As soon as you have a workout where more than one exercise has stalled (indicated in our hypothetical calendars with the B*), but not before, increase to four days between workouts. Continue adding rest as needed to resolve plateaus until you hit your target weight or end your bulking cycle. Important caveat: this spacing assumes you are consuming enough food to support rapid growth. Of the trainees who fail to gain significant muscular weight (significant = at least 2.5 pounds per week) on Occam\u2019s Protocol, 95%+ of them fail due to insufficient caloric/nutrient intake. The remaining 5% have nutrient absorption issues such as leaky gut syndrome, impaired stomach acid production, excessive fat excretion, insufficient bile, etc., or other conditions requiring medical attention before the protocol can do its job. I\u2019ve encountered only one such clinical case in the 5% group. He was 124 pounds at 6\u20321\u2033, and even when he attempted to gain weight by eating bag after bag of doughnuts in 24-hour periods, he could not gain a single pound. Don\u2019t assume you are in this unlikely minority. The most common problem is insufficient food intake. That leads us to the real challenge of Occam\u2019s Protocol. Eating. Occam\u2019s Feeding In the 1995 gaining experiment, I set an alarm to wake me four hours into sleep so that I could consume five hard-boiled eggs as an additional meal. It helped, to be sure, but it was also uber-inconvenient. Inconvenient eating schedules, no matter how effective, have a high abandonment rate after initial enthusiasm wanes. I prefer low-friction approaches that are less disruptive, even if it takes a few more weeks to reach my goals. Taking two to four more weeks to reach a mass goal is much better than constant irritability or quitting a program altogether. Some athletes eat 10 times per day to break up caloric load and avoid excessive fat gain. I find this unnecessarily inconvenient, particularly when you Page 257 are on a regimen of supplements that increases insulin sensitivity and GLUT-4 activity (see \u201cDamage Control\u201d). I eat four main meals per day for both fat-loss and muscular gain.

There is no need to mimic my hours, of course. Just look at my meal spacing as one option that has worked. Neil was different. He was prone to skipping breakfast and had little appetite. It was impossible for him to consume large meals from the get-go. The solution was to prescribe a calorie-dense shake for breakfast and increase the number of meals to achieve a proper food volume, even with smaller portions. NEIL\u2019S FOOD SCHEDULE 9:00 A.M .\u2014Protein shake (see below) 11:00 A.M .\u2014Protein bar (Balance Bar or, preferably, a Training 33 YouBar) 1:00 P.M .\u2014High-protein/-carb lunch (usually chicken breast with potatoes) 3:00 P.M .\u2014Protein bar 5:00 P.M .\u2014High-protein/-carb dinner (usually sushi/sashimi with extra rice) 7:00 P.M .\u2014Protein bar 9:00 P.M .\u2014Protein snack with carbs (chicken or eggs or tuna) 11:00 P.M .\u2014Protein shake The choice is yours: eat big or eat often. Fat gain will be slightly more with the former, and inconvenience will be much greater with the latter. Page 258 Pick one and make it your religion for four weeks. It\u2019s easy to lose a little extra fat later. A NOTE ON SKIPPING BREAKFAST If you skip breakfast even once a week, or opt for a nonbreakfast like coffee and toast even once a week, make the blender your first stop after getting out of bed. The following recipe can also be used as a meal replacement or pre-bed snack: 24 oz (3 cups) 2% or whole organic milk 30 g whey protein isolate (chocolate tends to work best) 1 banana 3 heaping tbsp almond butter with no added sugar, maltodextrin, or syrups 5 ice cubes Caloric and protein profile with 2% milk (approximate): 970 cal, 75 g protein The Fixer: GOMAD Everyone on these heavy squat programs who drank enough of it [milk] gained weight. Yes, everyone we\u2019ve ever heard of. \u2014Dr. Randall J. Strossen If the preceding diet and high-protein snacks don\u2019t elicit at least two and a half pounds per week of gain, add in one liter of 2% organic milk between meals, up to four liters per day. Four liters = roughly one gallon. This is the simple and rightly venerated GOMAD (Gallon Of Milk A Day) approach to mass gain, which\u2014along with squats\u2014has produced monsters for more than 75 years, including the incredible Paul Anderson and some of the greatest lifters the world has ever seen. I suggest adding a single liter per day each week (often in the aforementioned shake) and keeping a close monitor on fat gain, which can accelerate. Fat gain is not inevitable, but it needs to be monitored. Navel circumference measurements are a good estimation if you don\u2019t have access to other body composition devices. Reader Matt gained six pounds per week for three weeks (18 pounds total) using GOMAD as his only means of increasing calories during his \u201cGeek to Freak\u201d (G2F) trial, and his abdominal skinfold (two inches to the side of the Page 259 navel) remained four millimeters throughout. If you\u2019re eating enough at your main meals, you shouldn\u2019t need more than a liter per day to accelerate growth. Lactose-intolerant? Try incorporating one glass of organic whole milk per day into your diet. Don\u2019t be surprised if you can comfortably consume milk after 1\u20132 weeks. For many people, GOMAD or LOMAD (Liter Of Milk A Day) will be the only dietary change required to stimulate growth. If simple does the job, keep it simple. Occam\u2019s Prescriptions This protocol works without any supplementation whatsoever. There are, however, four supplements that I would suggest to those with the budget. The first two minimize fat gain and are covered in \u201cDamage Control\u201d and \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d: 1. Cissus quadrangularis (2,400 mg, three times per day) 2. Alpha-lipoic acid (300 mg, 30 minutes before each whole-food meal). Here are the other two: 3. L-GLUTAMINE L-glutamine is an amino acid commonly used as a post-workout supplement for tissue repair. In our case, I suggest it"

    "text": "for an alternative use from strength coach Charles Poliquin: intestinal repair. The food you ingest does no good if it isn\u2019t absorbed. It\u2019s like panning for gold with a chain-link fence. The anatomical equivalent of this porous chain-link fence is an assortment of digestive conditions, including leaky gut syndrome, for which L-glutamine has been shown to be a promising treatment. Rather than risk suboptimal food absorption, consume 80 grams of L- glutamine during the first five days of Occam\u2019s Protocol. I recommend 10 grams at a time every two hours on the dot until the daily 80- gram quota is reached. Powder mixed in water is easiest to consume, but capsules are more convenient for travel. After the initial five-day loading period, if you wish to consume 10\u201330 grams post-workout, it will speed repair and help prevent soreness. 4. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE Creatine increases both maximal force production and protein synthesis. Doses of 5\u201320 grams per day have been demonstrated as safe and largely devoid of side Page 260 effects, though people with preexisting kidney conditions should use creatine under medical supervision. Athletes generally use a \u201cloading phase\u201d of five to seven days at 10\u201330 grams per day, but this can cause severe intestinal discomfort. You can achieve the same muscular saturation with lower doses for a longer period of time. Take 3.5 grams upon waking and before bed for the entire 28-day duration. If you use powder, mix in 5\u20136 grams total, as losing one to two grams in solution is hard to avoid. My single favorite meal for mass is macaroni (preferably durum whole wheat), water-packed canned tuna, and fat-free turkey/bean chili. Use a little whole milk or Irish butter with the macaroni, add only one-third of the orange-flavored cancer powder, and prepare this in bulk. Mix the macaroni with a can of tuna and as much chili as you like, microwave it for one minute on high, and have it for breakfast in a bowl. I sometimes ate this meal two or three times per day, as prep time was less than three minutes if I made the macaroni in advance. For a higher-protein change of pace, feel free to substitute quinoa for the macaroni. It might sound funky, but trust me: this mess tastes delicious. Lessons From Neil Neil gained significant muscle for the first time in his life using Occam\u2019s Protocol. Not only did he add 10 pounds to his frame in four weeks, he also improved his strength 50 pounds on some lifts and doubled others. His minimum improvement was 21.4%. He used machines exclusively and used a dip machine in place of the incline bench press, as the former had less traffic: WORKOUT A Pull-down: 8 \u00d7 80 to 8 \u00d7 110 (+37.5%) Overhead shoulder press: 8 \u00d7 30 to 5 \u00d7 60 (+100%) WORKOUT B Page 261 Seated dips: 6 \u00d7 140 to 6 \u00d7 170 (+21.4%) Seated leg press: 11 \u00d7 140 to 12 \u00d7 190 (+35.7%) There is no need to reinvent the wheel or face challenges alone. Here are some of Neil\u2019s notes, in his words, on what to expect and what to do: \u201cAn unexpected side effect of the experiment is how, after the first few days and the initial shock of having to stuff my gullet to the point of feeling ill actually passed, I began to feel incredibly happy and content. \u201cLike everything, there\u2019s a pain period when you step out of your comfort zone. And just when it seems toughest, and you most want to give up (because it\u2019s too much time/work/energy, because you don\u2019t understand it, because you don\u2019t trust it), if you push through that moment, immediately afterward you break free and it becomes a habit that you feel you\u2019ve been doing all your life (and know you should have been doing all your life). \u201cThe workouts are the least challenging part of it. Going to the gym so rarely and for so short a time left me wanting more. I think the key is, like you told me in the gym, to know that you only grow in those last reps when your muscles want to give up. To really focus and keep pushing to complete failure is an internal battle, so one has to really have the"

And carry a pack with supplements and protein bars in your car or with you at all times, in case your schedule changes during the day.

This usually leads to throwing everything and the kitchen sink at them. In reality, to build large and vascular biceps, there is no need to do isolated arm work. All you need are two compound exercises (one high-rep and high-speed, and the other low-rep and low-speed) and, if you absolutely must do curls, include one lesser-known version called the \u201creverse drag curl.\u201d The First Compound Exercise: The Two-Handed Kettlebell Swing We covered this exercise in detail in \u201cBuilding the Perfect Posterior.\u201d Reps are 50+. The Second Compound Exercise: The \u201cYates\u201d Bent Row Page 263 Named after six-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates, who used it as a staple of his back routine, this exercise is a palms-up bent row performed with a slight 20\u201330- degree bend at the waist from standing. The bar will generally be at the top of the kneecaps in the bottom hang position. To minimize wrist pain, perform with an EZ bar if possible (here demonstrated with a standard Olympic barbell) and pause for a second at your hip crease, where the bar should make contact. The Reverse Drag Curl This exercise, ideally performed with a thick bar, develops the brachialis on the side of the upper arm and provides more constant tension than traditional curls. Traditional curls often place the elbow under the weight at the top of the moment, minimizing resistance: The suboptimal traditional curl The drag curl, in contrast, raises the bar straight up rather than in a circular motion, grazing the front of the body and maintaining tension throughout. Page 264 The \u201cdrag curl\u201d The above photos show a standard drag curl with palms up. To reverse it, as suggested, ensure your palms are shoulder width apart and facing down. Tempo and reps on both the row and the drag curl are the same as in Occam\u2019s Protocol, 5 up and 5 down. Page 265 Dave Palumbo was going to become a doctor. Then, somewhere between running track in college and his third and final year in med school, he became fascinated by muscular growth. That marked a fork in the path, and he opted to step outside of the laboratory and make himself a real- life experiment. He weighed less than 140 pounds when he started in 1986. By 1997, he was 310 pounds at"

    "text": "less than 10% bodyfat. In 2008 alone, in addition to training professional athletes and celebrities like WWE star Triple H, he trained more than 150 bodybuilders and physique competitors. Getting to 3.5% bodyfat or doubling your body mass isn\u2019t normal, but that is precisely Dave\u2019s forte: creating freaks of nature. This brings us to the kitchen in 1997, just before his apex of mass proportions. Dave was standing completely still, braced with his hands on the sink. He hadn\u2019t been gaining weight. Despite consuming six to eight Met-Rx meal replacement packets and four to five whole-food meals per day, the scale wasn\u2019t budging. He needed to eat more, but he couldn\u2019t chew and digest more solids without regurgitating. It was impossible. He\u2019d reached his solid food limit, so he had to augment with liquid. His Jewish grandmother harassed him about consuming raw eggs and the risk of salmonella poisoning, so he compromised: 12 eggs mixed in a blender and then microwaved for one minute. That formed the base. The full recipe was four ingredients: 12 warm blended eggs 1 cup apple juice 1 cup uncooked oatmeal 2 scoops whey protein powder Blending the concoction created a cement-like substance, which he then had to pour down his throat while stationed at the kitchen sink. He\u2019d conditioned himself to inhibit the gag reflex, which was critical, as the sludge moved at a glacial pace down his esophagus to his stomach. Page 266 Just another day at the office. Then he waited. Dave had learned from experience\u2014and thrice-daily cement feedings\u2014that he had to remain perfectly still for 15 minutes, no less, breathing slowly and allowing things to settle. Even shifting on his feet could trigger immediate retching. Stillness was important. There were times, of course, when the world didn\u2019t cooperate. He had once been late for a training appointment, so he force-fed himself, threw the blender in the sink, and jumped in his car to beat the clock. Keep in mind that, at 5\u203210\u2033 and more than 300 pounds, his legs were only a few inches from his stomach when seated. He had outgrown his car. In minutes, as he rushed through traffic, his mouth began to produce copious amounts of saliva, preparing his digestive tract for rejection. He did his best to achieve a Zen-like state, repeating \u201cPlease don\u2019t puke, please don\u2019t puke, please don\u2019t puke,\u201d like a mantra. He was almost there. Dave approached a light, and the car in front of him stopped short. He slammed on the brakes. This made his stomach slam into his thighs and he projectile-vomited onto the windshield, like Linda Blair in The Exorcist , for several long seconds. Not an inch of windshield was spared, and nothing remained in his stomach. Toweling off just enough to see, he raced to his client\u2019s house, jumped out of the car, and ran up to the front door. \u201cWhat the hell happened to your car?\u201d was all his client could say as Dave walked past him directly to the kitchen. It was time to have another shake. The calories were not optional. Gaining more than 180 pounds of muscle is possible, as is squatting with fourteen 45-pound plates on the bar, but neither is common. Doing the uncommon requires uncommon behavior. Rule #1 for Dave: eating would not always be for enjoyment. If you\u2019re attempting to gain large amounts of muscular weight, it won\u2019t always be enjoyable for you either. This is particularly true for the first week. Buckle up and get the job done.

    "text": "Common Questions and Criticisms CAN THIS FREQUENCY REALLY BE ENOUGH? Yes. Doug McGuff MD compares burn healing to muscle tissue healing to explain: Building muscle is actually a much slower process than healing a wound from a burn [which typically takes one to two weeks]. A burn heals from the ectodermal germ line, where the healing rate is relatively faster, because epithelial cells turn over quickly. If you scratch your cornea, for instance, it\u2019s generally going to be healed in 8\u201312 hours. Muscle tissue, in contrast, heals from the mesodermal germ line, where the healing rate is typically significantly slower. All in all\u2014when you separate all the emotion and positive feedback that people derive from the training experience\u2014solid biological data indicate that the optimal training frequency for the vast majority of the population is no more than once a week. For a much more in-depth discussion of recovery intervals, especially if you\u2019re science-inclined, I suggest Dr. McGuff\u2019s book Body by Science . HOW DO I DETERMINE STARTING WEIGHTS? The first A and B workouts will be longer than subsequent workouts, as you need to use trial-and-error to determine starting weights. Do this by performing sets of five repetitions in each exercise with one minute of rest in between. Cadence should be fast but controlled on the raising and two to three seconds on the lowering. Do not perform more than five reps per set. If you can lift more, wait a minute, increase the weight ten pounds or 10% (whichever is less), and attempt again. Repeat this until you complete fewer than five reps. After you fail to complete five reps, calculate 70% of your last full five- rep set. Take a three-minute rest and perform a 5/5 cadence set- to- failure using this Page 269 weight. Congratulations, you just performed your first proper set- to- failure for this exercise, and this weight will be your starting point for Occam\u2019s Protocol. For the shoulder press, use 60% of the last successful five- rep set instead of 70%. Let\u2019s look at a hypothetical first workout A, performed on a Monday. Here is how things might look for a semi-trained 150-pound male doing the pull-down (weights will differ from person to person of course, and that\u2019s why you budget at least an hour for these first workouts): 90 lbs \u00d7 5 reps (f/2) 19 (1-min rest) 100 lbs \u00d7 5 reps (f/2) (1-min rest) 110 lbs \u00d7 5 reps (f/2) (1-min rest) 120 lbs \u00d7 5 reps (f/2) (1-min rest) 130 lbs \u00d7 4 reps (f/2) (he failed to complete 5 reps, so 120 lbs was the last full 5-rep set) Then we do the math: 120 \u00d7 0.7 = 84, and we round up or down to the nearest weight we can actually use on a machine or bar, which leads us to 85 pounds. (3-min rest) 85 lbs \u00d7 8.4 to failure (5/5) The 8.4 just means your failure was reached at 8 + 4/10 of a repetition. Take a five-minute rest, then repeat this process with the shoulder press. Once finished with this first workout A, record the target weights you will use for your next A. Since this A was done on a Monday, your next few workouts will look like this: (Just finished: Monday\u2014Workout A) Thursday\u2014Workout B Sunday\u2014Workout A Wednesday\u2014Workout B Page 270 Sunday\u2014Workout A (notice the planned increase to 3 rest days preceding this workout) HOW DO I ADD WEIGHT? If you complete your required minimum of reps, add 10 pounds or 10% of the total weight in the subsequent workout, whichever is greater. In the example above, we crossed our seven-rep threshold with 85 pounds in the pull-down, so we will increase the weight to 95 pounds for the next workout, as a 10% increase would be less at 93.5 pounds. To maintain this rate of progress for even two months, you will need to eat like it\u2019s your job. Add shakes or milk if whole food is too difficult. WHAT IF I MISS A WORKOUT DUE TO TRAVEL? It is better to take an additional one to three days off than to half-ass a workout with different equipment that makes it impossible to determine progress or proper weights when you return.

    "text": "lost by an additional one to three days of rest. The other solution is to always use free weights with standard Olympic barbells, as these will be universal and comparable between facilities. Free- weight options are outlined in the preceding chapter. WHAT IF I DON\u2019T MAKE THE TARGET NUMBER OF REPETITIONS? This means one of two things: either you didn\u2019t stimulate growth mechanisms (insufficient failure during the last workout), or you haven\u2019t recovered (insufficient rest/food). If you miss your target by more than one repetition on the first exercise of a given workout, go home, take the next day off, then repeat the workout. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re scheduled for workout A on a Monday. The first exercise is close-grip pull-downs, and your target number of repetitions is a minimum of seven. If you complete six good repetitions or more, complete the entire workout. If you don\u2019t complete six repetitions for pull-downs, do NOT proceed to the shoulder press. Instead, pick up your gym bag and go home. Rest Tuesday, ensure proper nutrient intake by eating a ton, and come in Wednesday prepared to crush both exercises and proceed as planned. If you fail before the requisite number of reps, do not\u2014as many people do\u2014 decrease the weight and do another set (called a \u201cdrop-down\u201d or \u201cbreak-down\u201d set). Do nothing but leave. If you haven\u2019t recovered, you haven\u2019t recovered. Page 271 Continuing can easily stagnate you for two weeks or more. Cutting a workout short takes tremendous self-control and runs counter to gym culture. Be smart and opt for a 48-hour reboot instead of a two-week or three- week reboot. Last but not least, if you abandon a workout because you miss a set, add another recovery day between all workouts moving forward. In effect, you\u2019re just accelerating the planned decrease in frequency. There is very little downside to doing this. Twenty-four hours of additional time cannot hurt you, but underrecovering will screw up the entire process. HOW MANY CALORIES SHOULD I CONSUME? If you fail to gain weight after adding milk and shakes, chances are that you have a medical condition. It shouldn\u2019t be necessary to count calories, and I never have. There is one exception. If you believe you\u2019re doing everything right and still aren\u2019t adding pounds, confirm that you aren\u2019t vastly overestimating your food intake and hence undereating. Count calories and weigh food for a 24-hour period. For recording like this, I use the Escali food scale, which allows me to input the code for a food, provided in an included manual, to determine the protein, carbohydrate, and fat breakdown. Ensure that you are eating 20 calories per pound of lean bodyweight for 10 pounds more than your current lean bodyweight . Note that this is not necessarily your ultimate target weight (assuming you want to gain more than 10 pounds). Adjust this target number on a weekly basis. Let\u2019s say you are 160 pounds lean bodyweight (determined by body composition testing) and want to have 180 pounds of lean mass. You would check your diet to ensure that you are consuming 170 \u00d7 20 = 3,400 calories. This is the absolute rock-bottom minimum and also applies to non-workout days. All that said, remember: you shouldn\u2019t have to count calories. Keep it simple and you will gain. If the number on the scale isn\u2019t getting bigger, eat more. BUT WHAT ABOUT CARDIO? Think you need to hit the stationary bike or run to maintain or improve aerobic capacity? This isn\u2019t always the case. Doug McGuff MD explains: Page 272 If you are intent on improving your aerobic capacity, it\u2019s important to understand that your aerobic system performs at its highest when recovering from lactic acidosis. After your high-intensity workout, when your metabolism is attempting to reduce the level of pyruvate in the system, it does so through the aerobic subjugation of metabolism \u2026 since muscle is the basic mechanical system being served by the aerobic system, as muscle strength improves, the necessary support systems (which"

    "text": "includes the aerobic system) must follow suit. If you\u2019re a sprinter or marathoner, can you prepare with weight training alone? Of course not. But, if you\u2019re a noncompetitive athlete looking to avoid cardiovascular disease, do you need to spend hours spinning your wheels, literally or figuratively? No. The artificial separation of aerobic and anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism might be useful for selling aerobics, a marketing term popularized by Dr. Kenneth Cooper in 1968, but it\u2019s not a reflection of reality. Occam\u2019s Protocol develops both anaerobic and aerobic systems. WHAT IF I\u2019M AN ATHLETE? Though it depends on the sport, if you are a competitive athlete with frequent sports training, I would suggest a protocol designed for maximal strength gain and minimal weight gain. See \u201cEffortless Superhuman.\u201d WON\u2019T THIS SPEED OF LIFTING MAKE ME SLOW? Though this program is not designed for athletes (again, see \u201cEffortless Superhuman\u201d for that), there is no evidence that a 5/5 lifting cadence will make you slow. Let\u2019s take a look at one counterexample in a sport where speed is paramount: Olympic lifting. In 1973, an Olympic weight lifting team with no prior experience was formed at DeLand High School in Florida. Their main training protocol was slow, mostly eccentric (lowering) lifting. The team went on to amass more than 100 consecutive competitive wins and remained undefeated and untied for seven years. Letting weight training displace skill training is what makes athletes slower. A focus on muscles shouldn\u2019t replace a focus on sport. For competitors outside of the iron game, lifting is a means to an end. It shouldn\u2019t interfere with other sport- specific training. WHAT ABOUT WARM-UPS? Page 273 Take 60% of your work weight for each exercise in a given workout and perform three reps at a 1/2 cadence (1 second up, 2 seconds down). This is done to spot joint problems that could cause injuries at higher weights, not to \u201cwarm up\u201d per se. Prep sets for all exercises should be performed prior to your first real set at 5/5. In practical terms, the first few repetitions of each work set act as the warm- up. I have never had a trainee injured using this protocol. HOW SHOULD I WORK OUT WITH A PARTNER? If you work out with a partner, ensure that your rest intervals remain consistent. Three minutes should not bleed into three and a half because your partner is socializing or slow in changing weights. This is nonnegotiable. I have always lifted alone and use training time as near-meditative \u201cme\u201d time, which the counting of cadence reinforces. Many people benefit tremendously from workout partners, but I don\u2019t appear to be one of them. The exercises are chosen to be safe when performed alone. Even if you elect to train with partners, do not let partners help you. It will lead to them lifting the weight while shouting \u201cAll you!\u201d This makes it impossible to know how much weight you actually lifted. Feel free to lift together, but fail alone. WHAT ABOUT DROP SETS, REST-PAUSE, AND OTHERWISE EXTENDING FAILURE? This isn\u2019t needed and screws up your ability to control variables. Keep it simple and follow the rules. Most advanced trainers who use one-set-to-failure methodologies have observed better results from not extending failure. If you cannot move the resistance, it means you have failed. Extending it just consumes resources that could be applied to growth. ISN\u2019T X BETTER THAN Y? CAN I [INSERT CHANGE TO PROTOCOL]? If you want to be a competitive powerlifter, you will need another program. If you want to be outstanding in other lifts, you need another program. For the purposes of gaining 10+ pounds of fat-free mass in four weeks, however, this program does not require any modification whatsoever. If you want something else, choose something else. Otherwise, don\u2019t change it. CAN I JUST WORK OUT EVERY 12 OR 24 DAYS AS GURU X SUGGESTS? I\u2019M STILL GETTING STRONGER.

    "text": "produce strength gains. This can mean one workout per month in some cases. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, but let us make an important distinction: Doing the least possible to experience strength gains vs. Doing the least necessary to maximize size gain The latter is the objective of Occam\u2019s Protocol. Tissue growth is our highest priority, even though there will be significant strength gains. Doubling and tripling of your lifts in one to two months, as Neil and other trainees have experienced, is not uncommon. To support a high rate of fat-free growth, we need to overfeed and direct those excess calories to muscle. This is accomplished by stimulating protein synthesis and increasing the insulin sensitivity of muscle tissue itself through activation (translocation) of the GLUT-4 glucose transporters. Recall from \u201cDamage Control\u201d that the latter is best done through exercise, as we don\u2019t want to overdose on insulin. If you work out just once a month, this might represent one whole-body GLUT-4 window per month for effective overfeeding. This is unacceptable for us, and we\u2019ll aim for one workout per week at a minimum. WHAT TO DO IF YOUR GAINS SLOW WITH ONE SESSION PER WEEK? Rather than doing one full-body workout every 10\u201314 days, for example, test a split routine to facilitate strength gains while increasing your GLUT-4 windows to at least two per week. This is how you get very big, very fast without getting very fat. I\u2019ve successfully used the following three-workout split, most notably in 1997: Session 1: Pushing exercises Session 2: Pulling exercises Session 3: Leg exercises If you are unconditioned or deconditioned (atrophied), take one day between workouts (e.g., pushing, one day off, pulling, one day off, legs, one day off, ad nauseam) for the first two weeks, two days between workouts for the next three Page 275 weeks, then move to three days between workouts. The exercises I used, all performed at 5/5, were: Push: \u2022 Incline bench press \u2022 Dips (add weight when possible) \u2022 Shoulder-width grip shoulder press (never behind the neck) Pull \u2022 Pullover \u2022 Bent row \u2022 Close-grip supinated (palms facing you) pull-downs \u2022 Slow shrugs with dumbbells (pause for two seconds at the top) Legs \u2022 Leg press with feet shoulder width (do higher reps on this; at least 120 seconds before failure) \u2022 Adduction machine (bringing the legs together as if using the Thighmaster) \u2022 Hamstring curl \u2022 Leg extension \u2022 Seated calf raises In retrospect, I believe this volume of exercises to be excessive for most trainees. Using the first two exercises listed for each workout will produce at least 80% of the desired gains with less risk of plateauing. \u201cIt\u2019s just water weight.\u201d This dismissive comment is common in the lifting and diet worlds. Page 276 Now, carrying so much subcutaneous water that your head looks like a Cabbage Patch Kid is bad. However, purposefully putting more fluid and substrate in specific parts of muscle tissue can be incredibly useful. There are two different types of muscular growth that you can use to your advantage with a bit of inside knowledge. The names of both sound complicated\u2014myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic\u2014but the difference is really very simple. Let\u2019s start with a basic primer on muscle fibers. Every muscle fiber has two main parts: myofibrils, which are cylinder- shaped filaments that contract to create movement, and the sarcoplasm, which is the fluid surrounding the myofibrils that contains glycogen stores and mitochondria to provide energy (ATP). Myofibrillar hypertrophy 20 can be thought of as growth for maximal strength. The myofibrils in the muscle fiber increase in number, adding primarily strength and some size to the muscle. This kind of muscle growth is achieved by high tension\u2014doing one to five reps at 80\u201390% of your one-repetition maximum, for example. The strength output is limited to brief intervals, as you\u2019re developing fast-fatiguing type 2 muscle fibers. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy can be thought of as growth for maximal"

This kind of muscle growth is achieved through metabolic adaptations\u2014doing 8\u201312 reps to failure at a submaximal 60\u201380% of your one-repetition maximum, for example. But which is better? Is sarcoplasmic hypertrophy useless, nothing more than water? First things first: the claim that it\u2019s \u201cnothing more than water\u201d doesn\u2019t square Page 277 with the science. Dehydration of even 4% bodyweight can decrease muscular endurance 15\u201317%. More relevant to tissue growth, researchers such as Dr. Clyde Wilson of UCSF School of Medicine believe that water effectively acts as a transcription factor\u2014much like testosterone or growth hormone\u2014for protein production. There is evidence that growth factors are triggered by cell volume regulating elements (CVRE) that, in effect, tell DNA to replicate when intracellular hydration is optimal. If that weren\u2019t enough, as Dr. Doug McGuff has pointed out, when the water-containing interior of the cell is maximally hydrated, receptors for hormones, \u201csitting as they do on the surface of the cell membrane, become maximally convexed into the environment where the hormones are circulating, thus allowing for maximal hormonal interaction with the receptor sites.\u201d Just water. Bah. Second: the sarcoplasmic volume increase is not just a fluid (water) increase. It also corresponds to more mitochondria, more glycogen, and larger stores of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP, the energy currency of cells) and phosphocreatine (PC, a high-energy reserve). Not to mention increased capillarization from such training, which results in more efficient nutrient delivery through additional blood vessels. This is why Neil gained an average of 48.65% strength on his exercises (100% on one) in four weeks using what would be considered a sarcoplasmic lifting protocol. These strength increases are impressive by any measure, myofibrillar or otherwise. Will Occam\u2019s Protocol give you more strength than a protocol specifically designed for maximal strength? No, that\u2019s what the chapter \u201cEffortless Superhuman\u201d is for. But can Occam\u2019s make you much, much stronger and allow you to surpass most people in the gym? Yes. The conclusion: to decide on the best program for you, you need to know your objective. As usual, the more specific your goal and the more precise your training, the better your results will be.

    "text": "realize how important the note in my pocket would become. The Quest Exactly 24 hours later, serendipity entered stage left. I was enjoying French food and a bottle of Bordeaux with a 25- year- old female yoga instructor new to San Francisco, fresh from the Midwest. Talk drifted to the singles scene and then to her culture shock in places like the Castro, where drag queens and transsexuals have dinner next to dot-com millionaires. Nothing is taboo, and she was just getting acclimated. SF is, after all, the world\u2019s capital city of sexual exploration. Page 282 Several glasses further into the evening, she casually admitted that she\u2019d never experienced an orgasm. How we got to that topic, I don\u2019t remember, but I looked around to see if God was playing a trick on me. I\u2019ve never won the Powerball lottery, but I felt like I had. My daydream was interrupted when her follow-up comment slapped me back to reality: \u201cIt\u2019s fine, though. I\u2019ve realized that sex just isn\u2019t that important.\u201d Time-out. \u201cWhat?!\u201d I blurted, a little too loudly. (Thank you, wine.) This gorgeous woman in her prime, let\u2019s call her Giselle, had compartmentalized sex as an unimportant and uninteresting activity. As the drinks flowed and we continued to talk, it became clear that this rationalization was a direct product of her inability to fully enjoy it. And so it came to be that I made her a drunken promise: I would fix her inability to orgasm. Not that night, not necessarily through me, 1 but somehow. In retrospect, it was a foolish and overconfident promise. But with alcohol- induced optimism on my side, I viewed it as a watershed moment, an opportunity to harness my OCD for the greater good. Most men assume they kinda-sorta understand female anatomy, but\u2014the upper-left quadrant at one o\u2019clock? That was a new one. Tallulah had given me a glimpse of a different world altogether. Later that evening, somewhere between Wikipedia and PornHub, I realized Giselle wasn\u2019t alone. Sex researcher Shere Hite had long ago concluded that 70% of U.S. women couldn\u2019t experience orgasm from intercourse, and Alfred Kinsey\u2019s data suggested that up to 50% of U.S. women weren\u2019t able to achieve orgasm at all. My quest for the elusive female \u201cO\u201d had begun. The outcome, four weeks later, was better than I ever could have imagined. I was able to facilitate orgasms (the word facilitate will be explained later) in every woman who acted as a test subject. 2 The results: those who\u2019d never experienced manual-only orgasm were able to do so, and those who\u2019d never experienced penetration-only orgasm were also able to do so. The success rate was 100%. Here is what I learned. Page 283 The Process The morning after wine with Giselle, I wrote down a number of questions that seemed like good starting points. Several of them related to extending male endurance, if that were to prove a limiting factor. I figured I might need to train men to become Energizer bunnies. Some of the assumptions, reflected in the wording, turned out to be totally wrong, but here are my original questions: 1. How do you tweak the most common sexual positions to make it more likely that the woman will orgasm? 2. How can you reduce the refractory periods (the erection- impossible period after ejaculation) for men? This would allow more sessions per night. 3. Is it possible for men to have multiple orgasms without ejaculating? 3 4. How do you keep it \u2014the hoo-ha, that is\u2014from stretching out over time? (A female friend insisted I throw this one in.) 4 Once I had questions, I needed some answers. For that I would need two things: experts and lots of practice. First things first: experts. There is no shortage of how-to sexual information. From Chigong Penis (competes with the Iron Penis Kung-Fu school, not kidding) to orgasm training on elaborate vibrator-saddle machines like the Sybian, it\u2019s a paradox-of-choice problem. Considering the options, I started to think that I might be reenacting The Snow Leopard by Peter Matthiessen. In"

    "text": "1973, Peter traveled with zoologist George Schaller 250 miles into Himalayan no-man\u2019s-land in search of the near-mythical snow leopard. Not to be a spoiler, but he didn\u2019t find the goddamn cat. He saw rare mountain sheep, foxes, wolves\u2014even signs of the snow leopard itself\u2014but it was never found. Fortunately, Peter\u2019s experience led to a Buddhist-like search for meaning and a beautiful classic in nature writing. I doubted I could pull the same beauty out of Iron Penis Kung-Fu. My quest was all-or-nothing, and it needed a happy ending in all senses. I had no choice but to narrow down the field, to find someone who\u2019d already tried everything. Page 284 There was only one place to look. Nina and 400 Hollywood Nights Nina Hartley became a registered nurse in 1985 after graduating magna cum laude from San Francisco State University. She also started stripping her sophomore year, which led to experimenting in adult films. It was not a college phase. Nina has since starred or featured in more than 650 porn films and is one of the most recognized and respected names in the business. Lexington Steele, the only person ever to win the AVN (the Oscars of porn) Male Performer of the Year Award three times (three times!), has publicly stated \u201cwithout hesitation\u201d that the single greatest sexual experience of his life was with Nina. My friend Sylvester Norwood 5 later told me the same thing. But \u2026 WTF? His confession confused me. Not because I doubted Nina had the skills. But how the hell did Sylvester enter the picture? The same well-behaved Jewish boy too shy to talk to girls? [Shimmer and fade to reenactment] Straight out of Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not : Sylvester\u2019s mom attended a group dinner in Berkeley, California, that Nina also happened to be attending, and the two ended up seated next to each other. Mrs. Norwood came home and said to then-22-year-old Sylvester, \u201cGuess who I was at dinner with? A famous porn star: Nina Hartley. Have you ever heard of her?\u201d Sylvester nearly choked. In his secret double life, he had a huge collection of videos featuring Nina, his personal snow leopard. \u201cMom, I have to meet her. If I never do anything again in this life, I MUST meet Nina Hartley.\u201d Three days of insistent begging and nagging later, Sylvester\u2019s mom raised a hand and picked up the phone. \u201cHi, Nina, it\u2019s Mrs. Norwood. I had such a wonderful time meeting you at the party. Listen, I have a question for you. Do you ever make love to younger men?\u201d Nina\u2019s answer: \u201cWhy, yes! I love breaking in younger men \u2026 but only once.\u201d And so it happened. Summary: Coolest \u2026 mom \u2026 ever. Page 285 A decade later, Sylvester is still friends with Nina, and he introduced us via e- mail. The two-hour phone call that followed was a master\u2019s degree in all things sexual, but the most actionable highlights related to (1) the single most important precondition for female orgasm and (2) technical modifications of positions. THE PRECONDITION: WOMEN NEED TO STEP UP TO THE STARTING LINE FIRST \u201cNo man can give you an orgasm. He can only help you do it yourself.\u201d This is why I used the word facilitate earlier. First and foremost, Nina emphasized, a woman has to be comfortable masturbating. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t masturbate regularly, she\u2019ll be more trouble, baggage-wise, than it\u2019s worth, unless you get off on being the fixer. She has to at least come up to the starting line and be comfortable conversing with her own orgasmic potential.\u201d For years, Nina herself was too embarrassed to show her \u201cO face\u201d\u2014her face during orgasm \u2014to partners, thinking it was ugly or unattractive, not realizing that men go nuts for it. \u201cThe woman needs to know how beautiful and exciting she is in that state.\u201d Truer words never spoken. To those women who don\u2019t masturbate, Nina recommends starting in small increments, five minutes a night before bed or immediately after waking up, and listening to self-talk. What is your head telling you? Unwarranted guilt and shame? Both will pass with practice, and you must be"

    "text": "comfortable solo before it\u2019s possible with someone else. Thirty minutes after the interview with Nina, I called Giselle. 6 The verdict: she never masturbated. She was the eldest daughter in her family, an unexpected recurring theme I found among inorgasmic women, and had been raised Catholic. Her mother used scare tactics with religious overtones, repeating phrases like \u201cI hope your decision to abstain includes remembering your faith.\u201d This fueled a feeling of obligation to be a role model for her younger sisters, and the end product was predictable: she disallowed herself pleasure, viewing it as a hazard, and was now well on the path to asexuality. Step 1: I gave Giselle, who\u2019d agreed to play along, the book Sex for One by Betty Dodson, 7 along with a homework assignment to masturbate prior to bed for five minutes each night. Then I crossed my fingers. The next few weeks would show if her discomfort and disinterest could be fixed through simple conditioning. Page 286 In boxing, there is an expression: \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get hit.\u201d For Giselle and other women I later interviewed, it seemed that they often had Rocky-like sexual confidence until game time with a partner, when all the buried insecurities surfaced despite (or perhaps because of) their best efforts to suppress them. It was practice facing these demons that they needed, not better self-talk. Masturbation it was. I hoped five minutes of nightly homework would be enough. THE POSITIONS: PRECISION AND PRESSURE Nina emphasized two slight modifications to most positions: 1. Changing the angle of penetration so that the head of the penis makes more contact with the female g-spot, which is generally about a quarter in size and one to two inches inside the vagina on the top side. If the male inserts an index finger up to the second knuckle (palm up), and makes a come-hither motion, the fingertip should touch a sponge-like tissue or be within an inch of it. This is the g-spot. 2. Changing the pressure of the position so that the man\u2019s pelvic bone is in direct contact with the clitoris. The descriptions that follow are based on Nina\u2019s suggestions, as well as my [cough] research testing. The three positions described were chosen because the woman need not necessarily stimulate herself, as would be the case in doggy style. Improved-Angle Missionary On the facing page, notice that the woman\u2019s hips are elevated on a pillow to tilt her hips toward her head. Nina suggests buckwheat hull pillows, which are firm and, unlike foam or feather pillows, don\u2019t collapse. I fell in love with them in Japan, as the hulls conform to your head and neck to offer the perfect night\u2019s sleep. They conform equally well to female buttocks, while keeping them a perfect six or so inches off the bed. The man then moves his hips as close as possible to the woman\u2019s hips while keeping his heels under his buttocks. He should be sitting Japanese-style, sitting on heels with knees spread as wide as is comfortable. The lower he keeps his hips, the better the angle to hit the g-spot. 8 Experiment with different depths of penetration. Using a rhythm of nine shorter half-length penetrations with one long is particularly effective. Use the bottom of the opening of her vagina as a Page 287 fulcrum for the penis, which will act as a lever. The woman should test (a) pulling her knees toward her chest to tilt her hips toward her, and (b) placing her feet flat on the bed to elevate her hips. One will usually feel awesome, while the other will feel awkward. Note for the big gents on long strokes: if your penis is apt to hit her cervix in this position, which is not pleasant for women, \u201copen up\u201d one hip, as they say in the adult film business. Putting her bellybutton at twelve noon, aim your penis at ten or two o\u2019clock. This works for all positions where deep penetration is possible (doggy style, knees on shoulders, etc.).

    "text": "accomplish this position, the male must shift his weight forward a few inches. First, he must straighten his legs (bringing them closer together makes this easier) so the knees are off of the bed. Then he\u2019ll support more weight on her pelvis (the entire purpose) and his arms. Page 288 This changes the angle of penetration so that the focal point of friction is no longer the head of the penis against the vaginal wall, but rather the man\u2019s pelvic bone on the woman\u2019s clitoris. This kills two birds with one stone: the man can last far longer, and the woman receives direct clitoral stimulation. This modification was recommended by Nina, but she is not alone. Tallulah was emphatic: \u201cThe number-one move I would offer to men is the targeted pelvic grinding in this position, either moving the hips in small circles or slowly side to side.\u201d I later found bracing the abdomen muscles, even extending them a bit, and rocking the hips back and forth in a short one- to two-inch motion to be most effective. Imagine that, from just below your navel to the base of your penis, you are connected to the woman\u2014never lose contact with the clitoris. If you do this right, expect to feel like you did 1,000 sit-ups the next day. Just as one friend said to me as I ground the gears of my car on a steep hill in San Francisco: \u201cIf you can\u2019t find it, grind it.\u201d Bad advice in cars, good advice in girls. Conventional Cowgirl Position vs. Improved-Pressure Cowgirl Position Improved-pressure cowgirl puts the woman on top and re-creates the same penile position as in improved-pressure missionary. Page 289 The man should not be flat on his back, nor should he be sitting straight up. He should be leaning back about 20 degrees. This can be accomplished with pillows on a bed or, ideally, on an armless chair with a back that the woman can hold on to. The advantage of this position is simple: the woman can control the motion. Professor Nina offers the following advice for all intercourse: \u201cWhen in doubt, you supply the pressure and she provides the movement.\u201d The male can hold a vibrator to the clit in this position, but I opted not to because of the risk of distraction on both sides. As Nina-san sayeth: \u201cA vibrator can be a girl\u2019s best friend, or it can be as annoying as a mosquito.\u201d I could always bring in the heavy artillery after the fact, but I wanted to be ready for empty-handed encounters. I wanted to deconstruct the orgasm, and create it at will, without any tools. That\u2019s when the note in my pocket became the keys to the kingdom, which we explore in the next chapter .

It\u2019s vajayjay galore. There\u2019s very little advice in men\u2019s magazines, because men think, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. Just show me somebody naked.\u201d \u2014Jerry Seinfeld Stupid Animals Below is a composite scene that repeats itself millions of times per night around the world: Man finally gets to go downtown and fumbles to get his hand where it counts. Man starts random up-and-down or circular motion, hoping to God he can hit the spot and not act surprised. Woman moans and man thinks he\u2019s doing well. Woman stops moaning. Man shifts technique or goes into hyperdrive, and woman asks him to slow down a bit. Man slows down, and exactly five seconds of mild positive response later, nothing. Man feels like a dog trying to open a door with no thumbs. If he\u2019s out to beat the clitoris, dead or alive, as most men are, woman gently stops his increasingly erratic attack after 10 minutes. Best case, they move on to something the man can understand, like penis in vagina. He\u2019s a stupid animal, folks. Have mercy. Clitoral Confusion The clitoris looks something like an Imperial Guard from Star Wars. Page 294 It\u2019s also much larger than most people realize. The clitoral glans, what most refer to as the \u201cclit,\u201d extends back and splits into an upside-down V. Those legs, the clitoral crura, are concealed behind the labia minora. Some researchers believe that \u201cg-spot\u201d stimulation is actually stimulation of the crura and that all orgasms originate from stimulation of the clitoris. Other researchers, mostly male, disagree. This is nothing new. Men have been arguing about the clitoris for 2,500 years. It all (seemingly) started in 1559. Realdo Colombo of the University of Padua in Italy announced the discovery of the clitoris and planted his flag: \u201cSince no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it"

Hippocrates actually had Realdo beat by more than 1,300 years, but the clitoris seems to periodically go into hiding, often for decades at a time. Is it real? Is it an illusion? Is it alive? Is it dead? No one knew until it made a sudden reappearance, like Osama bin Laden on CNN. It\u2019s not hard to understand why men pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. If it doesn\u2019t exist, or if it\u2019s unpredictable, men can write it off as a female problem. If it\u2019s purely a female problem, men can\u2019t have their egos crushed like a grape between Serena Williams\u2019s butt cheeks. Clitoral Confidence Leaving dinner with Tallulah, I became fixated on the idea of a hypersensitive upper-left quadrant on the clitoris. Could it really be that straightforward? Page 295 I walked home from the restaurant that evening and jumped on my laptop to begin researching the one method Tallulah had mentioned by name: the Doing Method. Seventy-two hours later, I tested the upper-quadrant technique on a willing test subject who\u2019d never experienced an orgasm from finger-only stimulation. Two strong peaking orgasms and an extended 15-minute continuous orgasm later, I was shocked speechless. It worked on the first shot. But it was still guesswork, and I needed to make the technique bulletproof. To do that, I would need to meet not just a master but the master. Luckily, I had her name on a little scrap of paper: Nicole Daedone. Origins: More University Lafayette Morehouse was established by Dr. Victor Baranco in 1968 on Purson Lane in Lafayette, California. Operating as More University from 1977 to 1997, it was a commune founded on the ideal of \u201cresponsible hedonism.\u201d The residents painted the buildings and automobiles on the property purple, and their newsletter explained the rationale: We tell people that all the houses here are purple so that there is no mistake that one has changed realities should they wander onto our property. If people missed the purple, there were other warning signs for wanderers. In the 1960s, Baranco and his wife, Suzie, began researching how to improve their sex lives. Both believed that the amount of sensual pleasure available to an individual far exceeded the expectations commonly held in society. In 1976, after more than a decade of experimentation, they blew the floodgates open by giving the first public demonstration of female orgasm. It lasted three hours . That\u2019s a genital Dances with Wolves . The female student who demonstrated the orgasm, Diana, recalled the result it had on the wall-to-wall audience: When that demonstration was over, people RAN to every available space on the property so that they could get off, too \u2026 get the women off! It was really the women. Page 296 Not surprisingly, students flocked to Morehouse. Two students of the Morehouse methods for extending orgasm were Drs. Steve and Vera Bodansky, founders of the Doing Method I had taken for a test drive. Another was Ray Vetterlein, who took his first class at Morehouse in 1968, eight years before the public demo. He earned its highest private qualification in 1989 and has been refining his methods ever since \u2026 for more than 40 years. 8,000 Nerve Endings and Two Sheets of Paper Less than a month after dinner with Tallulah, I was witnessing some of Ray\u2019s findings firsthand. \u201cYou want to use about two sheets of paper worth of pressure,\u201d explained my chaperone Aiko, 9 who had organized the visit and was sitting to my right. Roger that. \u201cGo by how it feels, not by how it sounds.\u201d I scribbled down notes as four OneTaste practitioners, two seated next to me and two on the floor, demonstrated and explained the fine-tuning I needed. OneTaste was founded in 2001 by Nicole Daedone, a student of Morehouse and Vetterlein, to give women a clean and brightly lit place to learn about orgasm from"

    "text": "another woman. I\u2019d met with Nicole the afternoon before, and our conversation had started at neuroscience and ended with me recounting my trial run of the Doing Method. One thing was clear to her: there was much room for improvement. Now I found myself at OneTaste\u2019s coaching location in the SOMA district of San Francisco. Their expansion in both New York City and California has been funded largely by Reese Jones, who sold his software company Netopia to Motorola for $208 million. The \u201cslow-sex\u201d movement thus began and Nicole was its default leader. In San Francisco, I was playing Larry King: \u201cSo, can I ask exactly where you are touching the clit now? It\u2019s still an upward motion?\u201d I was positioned on an office chair with my elbows on my knees, looking down at the woman\u2019s vulva from about five feet away, where she and her male partner were positioned on pillows and throw rugs. Page 297 \u201cYou can get closer,\u201d said Aiko. \u201cSure. Get as close as you need to,\u201d added the woman on her back. So I did. I watched from a distance of about two feet, sometimes closer, as the woman\u2019s entire physiology changed over 15 minutes, asking questions and watching the man\u2019s technique. Then it was my turn. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d Aiko asked. \u201cAh \u2026 sure.\u201d Personal clitoral coaching was the last thing I thought I\u2019d be doing at 10:00 A.M . on a weekday, but I already had four pages of detailed notes. If I didn\u2019t put theory into practice, none of it would make sense later. So on went the latex gloves. My research partner arrived, and we repeated what I\u2019d just seen. The two coaches who\u2019d been sitting next to me earlier were now seated in front of me, kneeling about three feet from the woman\u2019s clitoris. They reached in occasionally to correct my hand position and offered intermittent suggestions (\u201censure your forearm is parallel to her body\u201d) or encouragement (\u201cgood stroke!\u201d). It was like playing for the coolest Little League team in the world. Go, Timmy, go! My partner experienced all of the involuntary muscle contraction I had hoped for, and the group coaching, though a little weird, wasn\u2019t uncomfortable in the least. Aiko asked me if I had any feedback after the session ended. I did. \u201cThis should be required education for every man on the planet.\u201d Orgasm, as defined by most women, is not gratifying. It\u2019s an all-or-nothing pressure that prevents the very phenomenon we\u2019re after. For purposes of practicing what\u2019s in this chapter, the following definition of orgasm is the most useful composite I found: Orgasm is when there is no resistance\u2014no physical or emotional blocking Page 298 \u2014to a single point of contact between one finger and the clitoris. This state naturally leads to the involuntary contractions and flushing that most associate with the word orgasm. Diana, the original Morehouse demo subject, concurs: I think, for men and for women, it\u2019s true that when you feel \u201cthis is it from the first stroke,\u201d that it really gets better from there. The Practice and How-To: The 15-Minute Orgasm I believe the two principal reasons the OneTaste method works so well is that (1) it is presented as a goalless practice, and (2) it decouples orgasm from sex. Kissing, fondling, disrobing, whispering, and requesting are all fun and wonderful parts of sex. Unfortunately, multitasking these actions often fractures the attention a woman needs to reach orgasm. We\u2019ll develop singular focus through isolated practice, and it can later be brought into sex. The technique requires 15 minutes of 100% concentration on approximately three square millimeters of contact. Nothing more. Test this and practice it. The payoff will alter your sexual experiences forever. I\u2019ll explain this from the standpoint of a man, as that\u2019s what I am, meng. 1. EXPLAIN TO YOUR PARTNER THAT IT IS A GOALLESS PRACTICE. This is 100% critical. There is no objective, just a focus on a single point of contact. The phrasing should emphasize this and remove all expectations and pressure: \u201cI\u2019m going to touch you for 15"

Just focus on the single point of contact. It\u2019s an exercise.\u201d The only focus should be on the short stroke\u2014one stroke, one stroke\u2014just as the emphasis would be on the breath\u2014one breath, one breath\u2014in most forms of meditation. View it as an exercise in mindful awareness. There is no goal. 2. GET INTO POSITION. First, the woman disrobes from the waist down and lies on her back using a pillow for neck support. Her legs are bent and spread, feet together in butterfly position. If this makes her hips uncomfortable on one or both sides, pillows can Page 299 be put underneath her knees. Based on the premise that it is easier to achieve the proper angle of contact with the left hand, the man should sit to her right side on top of at least two pillows and straddle his bent left leg perpendicularly across her torso, foot flat on the opposite side. Add as many pillows as necessary to relieve any pressure from his left leg on her abdomen. Too many is better than too few. His right leg is straight or relaxed in butterfly position. Despite the left-handed positioning, which is ideal, I\u2019m right-handed and impatient with poor fine motor control. I had more consistent luck sitting on the woman\u2019s left side and using my right hand. If you choose to do the same, it\u2019s important to tilt your right wrist toward you slightly as if you were looking at a watch. This creates a better finger angle. My preferred position as a right-hander Since I had the most success with this right-handed position, and since most of the world is right-handed, all illustrations are from this position, man seated on the left side of the woman. 3. SET THE TIMER FOR 15 MINUTES, FIND THE UPPER-QUADRANT POINT OF GREATEST SENSATION, AND STROKE. Limit the session to exactly 15 minutes. I used a kitchen timer. This removes performance pressure and creates a safe start-and-end container for the woman. Look at it as you would a yoga routine or deep breathing sequence. It is an exercise in focused repetition , not a goal. Page 300 1. Clitoral hood; 2. clitoral glans (the point of contact) ; 3. urethral orifice; 4. vaginal opening (introitus); 5. labia minora; 6. perineum. Finding the upper quadrant and anchoring (illustrated on the next page with the right hand): 1. Separate the labia Page 301 2. Retract the clitoral hood upward with the heel of the palm. 3. Anchor the clitoris with the right thumb by holding the hood back. Page 302 4. Put your left hand under her buttocks, two fingers under each cheek, with the thumb resting on (not in) the base of the entrance to the vagina (ring of introitus). This will act as an anchor and help the woman to relax. 5. Imagine you are looking directly at the clitoris from between her legs, with the top of the clitoris as 12 o\u2019clock on a clock face. Find 1:00 P.M .\u2014 ideally a small indentation or pocket between the hood and her clitoris\u2014 with your right hand\u2019s index finger and begin stroking using the lightest touch possible and only 1/16\u2033 or so of movement. The tip of the finger is better than the pad, so cut your nails beforehand. Nicole emphasizes the start: \u201cIf I can suggest one thing to the guys: take the time to find the spot. Once you find it, she won\u2019t be able to take more than a very light touch, like brushing satin against her skin.\u201d Stroke like a metronome at a constant speed for periods of two to three minutes, but feel free to change speed between periods. Page 303 Elbow brace variation. It is not uncommon for the man\u2019s lower back to tire. Fidgeting screws up everything, so I began testing an alternative elbow-brace position. Front angle of the elbow brace variation. You\u2019ll notice my left elbow is braced on my left shin. Since the angle no longer works for the introitus placement, I instead use my left hand to immobilize her right leg. Two women I practiced this alternate position with preferred it"

    "text": "to the textbook version. 6. \u201cGround\u201d at the end. Once the 15 minutes have elapsed, \u201cgrounding\u201d is performed to (ostensibly) ease the woman out of the experience. Though there are sophisticated options for this closing portion, novice males can simply apply strong pressure down on the pubic bone and up toward the woman\u2019s head, using overlapping hands as Page 304 indicated. Let her dictate the pressure. Most women, in my experience, find the strongest possible pressure the most pleasurable for ending a session. I initially thought this closing portion was a waste of time. \u201cGrounding\u201d? It sounded like a bunch of New Age nonsense. Now I believe that grounding is important not as some type of energetic witchcraft, but rather for closure. It consummates a complete experience with beginning (setup), middle (stroking), and end (grounding). This format gives both parties a sense of accomplishment that artfully helps avoid fixation on a full-blown orgasm as closure. Remember that it\u2019s the goalless nature of the practice that allows the relaxation that produces the orgasm. This guaranteed outcome (grounding) is smart and\u2014I now believe\u2014critical to include. Suggestions for a Successful Beginner\u2019s Session Based on coaching and practice, here are some helpful guidelines: \u2022 Light contact. Remember: two pages of paper as depth of pressure. No more. It takes a lot of strength and concentration to stroke lightly. \u2022 It isn\u2019t building toward anything. Keep the practice goalless and remember the intention: singularly focused repetition for 15 minutes. \u2022 Consider using a blindfold or airline eye mask on the woman. I\u2019ve found it makes them less self-conscious and increases tactile sensitivity. \u2022 Have her \u201cturn off the show.\u201d She doesn\u2019t need to please you. Make this clear. She doesn\u2019t need to moan and groan. It\u2019s about subtle sensation and nothing extra. \u2022 Make it fun and even call it an \u201cexperiment.\u201d Serious = tension. Keep it light. \u2022 Related to the above: no idle chatter. Some women will talk to distract themselves and prevent orgasm, or to prevent facial expressions of pleasure. This is an exercise in overcoming embarrassment, so the talking crutch should be removed. Using an eye mask helps minimize the talking impulse. \u2022 Reinforce relaxation gently if the woman seems tense or anxious: \u201cI notice you\u2019re tensed. Try and relax a little bit.\u201d If she\u2019s experiencing Page 305 strong contractions which will clearly exhaust her before 15 minutes are up, encourage her to breathe and push out slightly as if she were going to pee. She won\u2019t pee, and it will help her extend the plateau and minimize fatigue. Most common mistakes: \u2022 Being goal-oriented. This includes women who will ask for insertion or penetration. Do not oblige them until the 15 minutes are up. Sex is fine afterward, but not until the session is finished. Don\u2019t give in. She might beg in the moment, but she will thank you later for holding off. Once you\u2019ve completed five 15-minute sessions without caving in, feel free to break the rules and go nuts before 15 minutes are up. But not until you\u2019ve followed the rules for five sessions. \u2022 Asking \u201cnonwinning\u201d questions of the woman such as \u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d or \u201cAre you enjoying this?\u201d almost guarantees lying. Asking questions is encouraged, but use directional questions instead: \u201cWould you like a lighter or stronger stroke?\u201d \u201cMore to your left or right?\u201d \u201cHigher or lower?\u201d \u2022 Once again: using too much pressure. I consciously focused on a light touch when practicing the Doing Method for the first time, and I assumed it was light enough. It wasn\u2019t. I was using at least three times too much pressure. Imagine tickling a sleeping friend\u2019s nose just enough to make him scratch his own nose, but not enough to wake up. Once you\u2019re comfortable with the basic practice (five stroke-only sessions), but not before, try these: 1. Insert the middle finger of the nonstroking hand, palm up, and use a come- hither motion to stimulate the g-spot. After five minutes,"

Place a buckwheat pillow 10 under her hips for the same angle as the improved-angle missionary, and use your left thumb to anchor the clitoris while you perform cunnilingus at the one o\u2019clock upper quadrant of the clit. Do this as lightly as you would perform the stroke for at least five minutes, without finger insertion, and then add in #1 above with the right hand. Build a strong neck so Page 306 she doesn\u2019t pop your head off. Afterword: The Snow Leopard Cometh So did Giselle get to the finish line? Yes. And she ended up getting much more. It started with her masturbation homework assignments. \u201cI\u2019m similar to my closest friends in most ways, so I\u2019d assumed this would also be the case. It wasn\u2019t. I was the only one [who didn\u2019t masturbate].\u201d Once she started talking to her girlfriends about it, the entire subject became less taboo and became \u201cnormal.\u201d Suddenly sex wasn\u2019t something to be avoided. Now, it was something fun to talk about over a glass of wine. She also realized that she\u2019d been suppressing a critical part of herself, and that without a developed sexuality, she wasn\u2019t a fully developed person. It took discipline to overcome old habits and subconscious sabotage: \u201cIt was really tempting to come home from work and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m tired,\u2019 and go to bed without doing it. I really had to view it as practice, just like yoga. Practice is something you do even when you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Rediscovering her sensual self went far beyond the bedroom. Giselle started taking salsa lessons and was finally comfortable as a sensual being. Comfortable in her own skin, she finally felt free to express herself. Not in a haphazard manner, but free from unwarranted guilt or shame. The mind can rationalize terrible voids, and there is no need for it. Life is short, and sex should be a wonderful part of it. It\u2019s a fundamental part of our natural hardwiring. Isn\u2019t it time you let your hair down and had some real fun with it? All it takes is 15 minutes. It\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m fascinated by pharmaceuticals. I was buzzing on one of my favorites, caffeine, as I listened to my friend Violet Blue wax poetic about drugs at a sidewalk caf\u00e9: Page 307 \u201cAntihistamines can make you taste bitter, but it\u2019s simple to fix. Just add cucumber, mango, pineapple, papaya, or citrus to your diet.\u201d Benadryl was now on my blacklist. Cucumber was on the shopping list. The week prior, Violet, one of Wired magazine\u2019s \u201cFaces of Innovation\u201d and sex columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle , had kept Oprah rapt onstage for more than an hour. I wasn\u2019t surprised. Self-proclaimed sex educators often fall in the extremes, whether involving sex parties or worshiping the sex goddess Ix Chel. Violet was a different breed. Between lecturing to MDs at UCSF and speaking about sex to Google executives at their world headquarters, she had a simple person-to-person mission: to teach people how to safely get what they want in sex. \u201cStimulants like caffeine also make it harder to come,\u201d she added. I looked down at my coffee, and I looked down at my twins. Something else to experiment with. I\u2019d come to our lunch date armed with a list of must-answer questions, and she had already knocked most of them off like a major leaguer at a Little League game. But there was one question, the question, remaining: What would you recommend, step by step, to a woman who wants to have her first orgasm? Violet bounced a little in her chair and smiled, and I prepped my wrist for note-taking. She first brought up the cornerstones, erotica and self-exploration, and then added the details: 1. First, ask yourself a few simple questions: Have you ever felt anything close? Were you previously interested in sex but now you\u2019re not? Are you even interested in having an orgasm? Then watch Mary Roach\u2019s TED presentation entitled \u201c10 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Orgasm.\u201d 2. If embarrassment is an issue, get a copy of When the"

They\u2019re already 75% healed.\u201d Vesper had come out of the shower and was staring at my shoulders. \u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s fucking awesome! I\u2019m becoming Wolverine.\u201d I was referring, of course, to the superhero with mutant healing powers. He also has adamantium claws, but that\u2019s where Vesper was a much better comparison. The night before, she\u2019d inflicted bedroom wounds on my back and arms that weren\u2019t really \u201cscratches.\u201d The masterpiece: four 4\u20137\u2033 gashes in my right shoulder streaming blood that made me look like Bruce Lee from Enter the Dragon . Bruce in dire need of Neosporin. Now, less than 10 hours later, three of the gashes had disappeared completely, and the last and deepest was barely visible. Strange. The strangeness started much earlier, well before the bedroom, at The Americano restaurant. Friday at 8:00 P.M . brought the crowds, and the alpha investment bankers were fighting the alpha lawyers for female attention everywhere inside Hotel Vitale. The pressed shirts and dresses spilled from the outdoor patio into the restaurant, where we had reservations. It took a chaperone using football-like blocking to get us to our booth in a secluded back corner. The catch-up chat with Vesper looked like this: H ER : \u201cHow are you?\u201d M E : \u201cUnbelievable. But I need to give you fair warning. My biochemistry is very different from the last time you saw me. I feel \u2026 well, superhuman.\u201d H ER ( EYEBROWS RAISED ): \u201cOh reeeeally? Details, please.\u201d Yes, really. The last time we\u2019d met, I had just taken my total testosterone from 244.8 to 653.3 ng/dL (nanograms per deciliter), while cutting my estradiol Page 313 (estrogen) in half. The subsequent roughhousing had been a physical encounter of the first class. This time around, I\u2019d just returned from Nicaragua, where I ate grass-fed beef three times per day for 21 days. I had protein-loaded for the last three days, eating two to three pounds of fatty organic grass-fed beef per day, including at least 400 grams just before bed. (Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t suggest that you do this.) The result? Fifteen minutes after we sat down, Vesper was in a sexually aggressive stupor. The bread hadn\u2019t arrived and she was already climbing on top of me. This is not a boast. This is not Penthouse Forum. It\u2019s a statement of pure confusion. She is a CEO, and this is not typical public CEO behavior. I thought she was on drugs. Heavy nose breathing, interrupted occasionally with \u201cWhat is going on? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on \u2026\u201d The whole spectacle was surreal. She was, literally, intoxicated on pheromones.

The animal kingdom was alive and well in San Francisco. Dinner ended immediately thereafter, and it was a short trip to her apartment on the 21st floor and our version of Enter the Dragon , complete with furniture smashing and most of the same sound effects. 11 The next morning, after more of the same, I asked her, \u201cDo you have a gong on the other side of your headboard?\u201d It turned out to be metal artwork hanging on the neighbor\u2019s wall. After her second shower, and taking another look at my shoulder, Vesper had just one thing to say: \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing\u2014keep doing it.\u201d The Death of the Metrosexual: Reclaiming Aggression Things hadn\u2019t always been this way. In fact, for several years, things were quite the opposite. Somewhere between late 2007 and 2009, at 30\u201332 years old, I found myself in an odd place: able to perform in the bedroom as well as I had in college, but Page 314 having less and less desire to do so. Even with the most attractive of girls, after a week or two of rabbit love, sex frequency would drop to once a day. Then it would drop to a few times a week or once a week. I enjoyed sex as much as ever, once in the act, but fatigue or disinterest often led me to opt-out. \u201cI\u2019ll get to it in the morning\u201d became a constant self-promise. It made no sense. I was young, athletic, and felt perfectly healthy. Then, looking under the hood, I ended up in the lower-range of \u201cnormal\u201d for total testosterone in blood testing. What was the problem? POSSIBLE SHORT CIRCUITS Testosterone is a molecule of many dependencies. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which tells the pituitary (anterior pituitary) gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH then stimulates the Leydig cells in the testicles to produce\u2014ta-da\u2014 testosterone . Page 315 It is a major but rampant mistake to treat low testosterone with external testosterone in the form of a gel or injection 12 without troubleshooting the upstream parts of the axis first. It\u2019s also a mistake to think of low libido as strictly a low-testosterone problem. In 2004, I experimented with a hormone and drug called human chorionic gonadotropin, commonly known as \u201chCG,\u201d which effectively acts as a form of luteinizing hormone. Injected once per week, it immediately had the effect of more than tripling seminal volume and requiring\u2014 requiring \u2014ejaculation three to four times per day just to think straight. If you want to kill productivity, look no further than hCG. This inconvenience was compensated for by sex with my girlfriend, which jumped from a few times a week to a few times a day. Happy days. So just inject hCG and problem solved, right? Not quite. Here\u2019s the catch: repeated use of hCG can desensitize the testes to real luteinizing hormone. 13 Then the testes can\u2019t receive the signal to produce testosterone naturally. Big trouble. This disqualifies hCG as a permanent solution, but it suggests that increasing luteinizing hormone (LH) increases sex drive. But, you might ask, couldn\u2019t the sex drive be due to more testosterone, since luteinizing hormone (and therefore hCG) stimulates its release in the flowchart? This is true, but I\u2019d also used straight testosterone injections earlier in 2004 (as detailed in \u201cThe Last Mile\u201d), which more than doubled testosterone levels but didn\u2019t improve libido at all. LH seems to do more. LH also correlates perfectly with the heightened sex drive experienced by women just prior to ovulation. 14 Page 316 My Solution: Two Protocols I didn\u2019t consume much red meat for my first increase from 244.8 to 653.3 ng/dL, and I believe this type of jump can be achieved without eating red meat at all. The meat marathon was actually for tracking changes in food allergies. I now use two protocols that I believe are effective for"

The second is for short-term \u201cnitro\u201d boosts of sex drive and testosterone. Sheer fun, in other Page 317 words. The detailed rationales behind each can be found in \u201cSex Machine II\u201d in the Appendices, but let\u2019s start with the nutshell version. PROTOCOL #1: LONG-TERM AND SUSTAINED Fermented cod liver oil + vitamin-rich butter fat \u20142 capsules upon waking and before bed Vitamin D3 \u20143,000\u20135,000 IU upon waking and before bed (6,000\u201310,000 IU per day), until you reach blood levels of 55 ng/mL. Short ice baths and/or cold showers \u201410 minutes each, upon waking and right before bed Brazil nuts \u20143 nuts upon waking, 3 nuts before bed (see important footnote). 15 PROTOCOL #2: SHORT-TERM AND FUN \u201cNITRO BOOST\u201d 20\u201324 Hours Prior to Sex Eat at least 800 milligrams of cholesterol (example: four or more large whole eggs or egg yolks) within three hours of bedtime, the night before you want to have incredible sex. The Wolverine intro to this chapter was partially thanks to two \u00be-pound rib-eye steaks the night before, but it\u2019s easier to stomach hard- boiled eggs. Why before bed? Testosterone is derived from cholesterol, which is primarily produced at night during sleep (between midnight and 4:00\u20136:00 A.M .). Four Hours Prior to Sex 4 Brazil nuts 20 raw almonds 2 capsules of the above-mentioned fermented cod/butter combination Sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is the party spoiler. SHBG binds to testosterone 16 and renders it inert for our purposes, and \u201ctotal testosterone\u201d in blood tests can therefore be misleading. Some vegans have been shown to have higher testosterone levels than both meat-eaters and vegetarians, for example, but higher levels of SHBG cancel out this advantage. In other studies, consumption of cholesterol has been shown to be inversely correlated Page 318 with SHBG. In other words, the more cholesterol you eat, the less SHBG you have. From Carruthers\u2019s Androgen Deficiency in the Adult Male: Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment: Strict low cholesterol diets have been shown to lower total and free testosterone levels by 14%. Vegetarian diets, especially if low in protein, can increase SHBG, further reducing FT [free testosterone]. However, men put on a low-fat, high-fiber, vegetarian diet have a 18% reduction in both total testosterone and FT, which is reversed when they go back on a normal diet.\u2026 Conversely, high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets, such as the fashionable weight-reduction Atkins diet, may partly exert their slimming action by raising total testosterone and lowering SHBG. SHBG isn\u2019t evil, and we don\u2019t want to eliminate it, but a little less SHBG equals a little more free testosterone. This isn\u2019t evil either. It actually makes life much more interesting. This is the reason for our cholesterol-loading in Protocol 2. How Well Can It Work? Here is a sample of before-and-after sex hormone results from my first experiment (protocol 1), excluding Brazil nuts, which were added later: APRIL 3, 2009 (BEFORE) TO AUGUST 20, 2009 (AFTER) Total testosterone: 244.8 to 653.3 (normal: 170\u2013780; it would later jump to 835, more than tripling my original value, with the addition of Brazil nuts) Free testosterone: 56 to 118 (normal: 47\u2013244) Percentage free testosterone: 2.3% to 1.8% Bioavailable testosterone: 150 to 294 (normal: 128\u2013430) Albumin: 5 to 4.6 (normal: 3.5\u20134.8) DHEA-S: 170.5 to 201.8 FSH: 6 to 8.5 (normal: 1.27\u201319.26) Estradiol: 39 to <20 (normal in males: <47) Page 319 Eager to give it a shot?

Let\u2019s take a closer look at what happened to my blood and cholesterol after those 21 days in Nicaragua, 21 days of consuming at least 30% of my calories as beef fat and 200\u2013300 grams of protein and 40\u201370 almonds per day. I expected the worst. Here is the real impact on two common concerns: cholesterol levels and kidney function. BEFORE (AUGUST 20, 2009) vs. AFTER (SEPTEMBER 25, 2009) Cholesterol Total cholesterol: 200 (borderline out-of-range) vs. 190 HDL: 57 vs. 57 LDL: 133 (out-of-range) vs. 108 VLDL: 10 vs. 25 Cholesterol/HDL ratio: 3.5 vs. 3.3 Triglycerides: 48 vs. 124 (normal: <150) Kidney function BUN: 17 vs. 18 (normal: 7\u201325) Creatinine: 1.0 vs. 1.1 (normal: 0.7\u20131.2) BUN/creatinine ratio: 16.4\u2013 17 (normal: 10\u201320) Even I was stunned. I took no cholesterol-lowering (or HDL-raising) drugs or supplements, and a 21- day marathon of red meat actually improved my cholesterol/HDL ratio, which most doctors view as an indication of cardiac health. I also lowered both total and LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol. I ended up within the \u201clow-risk\u201d range for triglycerides, according to the American Heart Association, but there was an elevation. I expected the increase for three reasons: Page 321 1. Triglycerides transport dietary fat, and I had been consuming massive quantities of fat. 2. Fat-loss can produce transient elevated triglycerides (as it did with my dad, who lost 70+ pounds of fat), and I had lost substantial bodyfat in the preceding 21 days. 3. I had consumed 14 ounces of pulp-free orange juice the morning before the blood draw\u2014the first time I\u2019d done so in at least a year\u2014to measure my blood sugar response. Fructose, the sugar in fruit, is well known for rapidly increasing both triglycerides and LDL. All cardiac markers were brought within normal range within weeks of stopping the animal flesh binge. When I retested on October 16 (21 days later), my triglycerides had dropped from 124 to 82, and my VLDL had dropped from 25 to 16. What of the BUN and creatinine, considered indicators of kidney stress? Both were nominally elevated but well within normal range. I\u2019m amazed that both weren\u2019t higher, considering that muscular damage can increase both BUN and creatinine, and I had done a squat workout"

Between 2006 and 2009, I had obsessed over lowering my total cholesterol. The outcome? Lower testosterone and fatigue. I\u2019ll take my egg yolks, thank you very much.

Named one of just 20 Howard Hughes Medical Institute professors nationwide, Guillette was not speaking in metaphor. He had the data to prove it. The sperm counts of men in the United States and 20 other industrialized countries have been falling since 1942 at a rate of roughly 1% per year in healthy males. The average northern European sperm count in the 1940s was more than 100 million sperm per milliliter (million/ml) of ejaculate. In 2008? \u201cThe sperm counts of the majority of 20 year old European men are now so low that we may be close to the crucial tipping point of 40 million per milliliter spermatozoa \u2026 we must face the possibility of more infertile couples and lower fertility rates in the future.\u201d In Denmark, more than 40% of men have already dropped below the 40 million/ml threshold and entered \u201csub-fertility.\u201d The research is, as always, controversial.

    "text": "while other studies contradict the findings, and we all end up more confused than before. To sidestep the bickering, I tracked my sperm count and quality over 18 months and looked at the trends firsthand. From a selfish Darwinian standpoint, I didn\u2019t care about Heinrich\u2019s balls in Copenhagen. I cared about my own. It all started with a trip to a sperm bank in 2008 (see sidebar in this chapter), when I had no intention of trending anything. I\u2019d had a few too many brushes with mortality, witnessed a 30-something friend get testicular cancer, and decided it was a good idea to begin freezing my swimmies while at their healthiest. Unlike fine wine, sperm count does not improve with age. After all, what if I got married and then had an accident or needed chemotherapy? I wanted a worst-case scenario insurance policy. Getting an accurate sperm count never occurred to me as important. My blood Page 326 work was immaculate. I was a strapping 31 years young. My diet was as clean as a Mormon\u2019s breakfast, and I was hitting new personal records in the gym. Why would I bother to think about it? It was obvious that I didn\u2019t need to. Unpleasant Surprises Then the shocker: the lab results, which were available the afternoon after my session, put my sperm count on the low range of normal, borderline problematic. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Assuming it was a lab mistake, I repeated the drill three weeks later and came back with an even lower count. The more tests I did over the next 12 months, the lower the results. Holy Christ. I was terrified. But what were the possible causes? Was it the phthalates in everything from shampoo to deodorant? Bisphenol A in everything from household electronics to plastic bottles? Tightie-whities? There was no consensus. It could have been one of a million suspects, or it could have been all of them. No matter the causes, the real question was: could I do anything to reverse it? To start, I attempted to remove environmental pollutants from my body using injections (IV DMPS, etc.) and dietary changes, and the changes in blood work were almost unnoticeable. What else could I do? Besides avoiding plastics and going organic, the sad answer seemed to be: not much. I called some of the most experienced and innovative urologists in the United States, including Dr. Dudley Danoff, founder of the Tower Urology Medical Group at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who served as a clinical faculty member at UCLA Medical School for 25 years. His most striking comment was a disheartening one: \u201cMale fertility is a relatively \u2018infertile\u2019 field. There is so little one can do.\u201d Then came August 31, 2009. In preparation for an unrelated interview with famed strength coach Charles Poliquin, I had asked a friend in the fitness business for his dream list of questions. One of the side notes in his e-mail read: He won\u2019t use a cell phone due to radiation, states they have a high tested correlation between low T levels in athletes and cell phone carried in Page 327 pocket. \u201cT\u201d in this case refers to testosterone. The interview with Charles was a fascinating romp through all things performance-related, ranging from the endocrine system to intravenous vitamin C treatment and genetics testing. In the middle, as we were shifting topics, I asked Charles if he\u2019d observed a correlation between cell phone use and low testosterone counts. \u201cIt\u2019s not just something I\u2019ve observed. Take a look at the studies.\u201d So I did. Lo and behold, jumping from article to article on MedLine, there were more than a handful of studies that showed significant decreases in serum testosterone in rats following even moderate exposure (30 minutes per day, five days a week, for four weeks) to 900 megahertz (MHz) radio frequency (RF) electro-magnetic fields (EMF), which is what most GSM cell phones produce. Then, the epiphany. In the \u201crelated articles\u201d pane next to one such study, I noticed research focusing on the effects of cell phone radiation on sperm. One click opened Pandora\u2019s"

    "text": "box, but let\u2019s cover basics before we look at what I found. There are principally three things an MD will first look at when evaluating sperm: 1. Count: How many swimmers do we have total? 2. Morphology: How many swimmers have the proper tadpole-like shape? 3. Motility: How many of them can actually swim forward, which is the right direction? If the sperm is misshapen or can\u2019t move, it doesn\u2019t matter how many you have. If you have great swimmers but not enough to survive the kamikaze one- way trip, you are equally screwed. Of the dozens of studies that I found, most done in Europe, more than 70% concluded the same thing: 17 cell phone radiation impairs sperm function. The explanation for how it does this varied, but the outcome was never good. Here are just two abstract highlights from 2008 and 2009: Page 328 Three hundred sixty-one men undergoing infertility evaluation were divided into four groups according to their active cell phone use: group A: no use; group B: <2 h/day [hours/day]; group C: 2\u20134 h/day; and group D: >4 h/day\u2026 . The laboratory values of the above four sperm parameters [mean sperm count, motility, viability, and normal morphology] decreased in all four cell phone user groups as the duration of daily exposure to cell phones increased. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Male albino Wistar rats (10\u201312 weeks old) were exposed to RF-EMR [radio frequency electro-magnetic radiation] from an active GSM (0.9/1.8 GHz) mobile phone for 1 hour continuously per day for 28 days. Controls were exposed to a mobile phone without a battery for the same period.\u2026 Rats exposed to RF-EMR exhibited a significantly reduced percentage of motile sperm. CONCLUSION: Given the results of the present study, we speculate that RF-EMR from mobile phones negatively affects semen quality and may impair male fertility. The rat balls were exposed for one hour per day for 28 days?! In California, where I live, 30% of the population relies exclusively on cell phones for communication. I had carried a cell phone in my pocket an average of at least 12 hours a day for the last 10 years. No more. It didn\u2019t hurt me to put it somewhere else, and the evidence was strong enough to warrant a trial. Eleven weeks later, I had my first round of results. Happy Endings For eleven weeks, I adopted one new rule: my phone was no longer allowed to cuddle with my testicles. Its new home was a black InCase iPod armband intended for jogging. I could strap it to the outside of my upper arm or calf, or\u2014if headed somewhere jogger fashion wasn\u2019t cool\u2014I could simply turn the phone off before putting it in my pocket. In the latter case, or when running quick errands sans armband, checking messages every 30 minutes resulted in a grand total of zero problems. The front pocket of a backpack or bag also works. Page 329 I waited 11 weeks to retest for a specific reason: sperm production (spermatogenesis) takes an estimated 64 days in humans. I wanted to wait at least that long and added two weeks as an extra buffer. I returned to the sperm bank for my deposit and testing on November 19, 2009, nervous as hell. The anxiety wasn\u2019t necessary. I had nearly tripled my motile sperm per ejaculate. The numbers were almost unbelievable: Ejaculate volume: 44% increase Motile sperm per milliliter: 100% increase Motile sperm per ejaculate: 185% increase I let out one of the longest exhales of my life as I looked at the lab test fax. The trend had reversed. Can I attribute these increases to removing the cell phone and nothing else? It isn\u2019t quite that easy. I also started cold treatments and supplemental selenium (Brazil nuts), both of which could have contributed, the latter more likely than the former. Do I care about the academic purity? No. I was more concerned with increasing sperm count than isolating variables. Even with two confounding variables, the experiment is directionally valid. Should you wait for a scientific consensus? I don\u2019t think so. This is a case where the current literature is strong enough, and"

If you want kids someday, consider yourself warned. I never thought I\u2019d visit a sperm bank. Perhaps it was flipping a motorcycle at 90 miles per hour on Infineon Raceway. Perhaps it was tearing my Achilles tendon in jiu-jitsu practice, then getting thrown on my head. Page 330 Maybe having my scuba mask fill with blood at 120 feet underwater in Belize? That could have done it. Or perhaps it was just crossing the 30-year age threshold and having friends who didn\u2019t make it. Suicide, 9/11, accidents\u2014bad things happen to good people. I came to realize then: it\u2019s really not that hard to die. And that\u2019s when I started thinking about storing my genetic material. Yes, my little swimmies. In this sidebar, I\u2019ll talk about the process, how I did it, and why it\u2019s cheap insurance in an unpredictable world. I\u2019ll also throw in some curious details (sexy time!) just for entertainment. Doing the research, the pros far outweigh the cons: 1. Men are becoming progressively infertile. Go munch on some soy crisps for a mouthful of phytoestrogens, or just stick with preservatives. It\u2019s hard to avoid testicle-unfriendly food and toxins. Talk to endocrinologists who do clinical analysis and also get your sperm count measured. It is probably less than your dad\u2019s. Real-world Children of Men (for men) is in full effect. 2. Many medical conditions and procedures (cancer treatment, for example) can render men infertile. 3. People who \u201cknow\u201d they don\u2019t want kids change their minds. A lot. Just look at the number of vasectomy reversal procedures. And no, these procedures do not work well. Failure rates are high. 4. Above all, why not do it? If you can afford it, it\u2019s a no-brainer for peace of mind. The potential downside of doing it (cost) is recoverable; the potential downside of not doing it is irreversible. Think it\u2019s easy to get someone pregnant? Sometimes. Most of the time, after looking at the numbers, it seems surprisingly hit-or-miss. To be clear, I think adoption is a beautiful thing. I just also want to have children who look like me, and I see no reason not to ensure both can happen. I want Mama Ferriss to be Grandmama Ferriss at some point, even if my testicles check out before I do. Call me old-fashioned. Page 331 Is this ego-driven? On some level, of course it is. But so is owning a home or having a decent car, wearing clothing besides what will keep you warm, and doing anything past the base necessities for survival. Humans are ego-driven. I\u2019m human, ergo I\u2019m ego-driven. 1. FIND A SPERM STORAGE FACILITY. Google \u201csperm storage,\u201d \u201csperm bank,\u201d or \u201csperm donor,\u201d along with your state or city. 2. MAKE AN INITIAL APPOINTMENT AND GET TESTED FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Most reputable locations will require testing for common STDs prior to storage. I was tested for: HIV 1 & 2 HTLV I & II RPR (for syphilis, Al Capone\u2019s farewell song) HCV (for hepatitis C) HBsAG and HBcAB (for hepatitis B) Cost of initial consult: $100\u2013150 Cost of STD lab panel: $150\u2013200 It\u2019s a romantic first date. And yes, I cleared with flying colors. 3. WARM UP YOUR WRISTS AND GET BUSY. SIX SESSIONS PER KID. Think it\u2019s \u201cone shot, one kill,\u201d macho man? Think again. You\u2019re no Peter North, and even if you were, 50%+ of your sperm count is annihilated by the freezing process. You should make six sperm deposits for each child you\u2019d like to have. It can take over eight months for a woman to get pregnant with insemination, although in vitro fertilization (IVF) ups the chances somewhat at much higher cost, generally $9,000\u201312,000 per attempt. Oh, and forget about abstaining for long periods of time, oddly enough. Page 332 For best storage and later fertilization, abstain from ejaculation for at least 48 hours but no more than three days (72 hours) before each session. It\u2019s a tight window.

About as sexy as lethal injection, right? Well, upon arrival, there were surprises in store. I was led to a cornucopia of porn DVDs around a secret corner. Right in front of a bunch of female lab technicians looking awkward. There was something for everyone in this motley selection. Blind juggler fetish? It would\u2019ve been there. No expense was spared in covering all bases. I grabbed a few titles (I\u2019ll spare you the names) and headed to a small white room with a sliding door. I followed the lead of a quiet male Asian assistant in a white lab coat. He looked at his feet and departed with \u201cPlease wash your hands when you finish.\u201d I didn\u2019t expect a call the next day. The den of clinical sin was about the size of a hotel bathroom, with a paper Page 333 sheet\u2013covered cot on the floor (yeah, baby!), a metal chair, a 13\u2033 TV/DVD combo on a small stool, and a stack of magazines suspiciously adhered to one another. So I sat down, still quite content and ready to do my duty. For once, I could think of solo time as a productive activity! I enthusiastically popped in the DVD, sat down to get relaxed, and then \u2026 my brain got sodomized. See, I live in San Francisco, and, well, there are a lot of \u201calternative\u201d sexual orientations. It also happens, sad times for Tim Ferriss, that Mr. Wash-Your- Hands was not good at matching DVDs to their cases. Within seconds of sitting down, I\u2019d come to the realization that this room, with paper sheets in all their glory, had been used by hundreds of other donors. That alone required me to enter a state of focus reserved for Olympians and Iron Chef competitors. Then I turn on the DVD and see two hairy boys doing something resembling wrestling. But not wrestling. Second DVD, same story. Third time was the charm, but I was already suppressing so many images and realities that it was like bending a spoon with my mind to get done what every guy has mastered by age 12. Ah, Mr. Wash-Your-Hands. We will meet again, and I shall give you a judo chop. Mentally prepare, gentlemen. It won\u2019t be as easy as you think. These are tough, dangerous times.

It will nourish itself on any kind of thinking, including thinking about not thinking. \u2014Clifton Fadiman, former chief editor, Simon & Schuster \u201cG od, what a beautiful beach. Calm. Translucent turquoise water. I should really go back to Thailand. I wonder what time it is in Thailand. But \u2026 why is there a mangy German shepherd on my beach? Orange collar. That makes no sense. Kind of looks like John\u2019s dog. Actually, I owe John a call. F*ck. Did I put his birthday party in the calendar? Birthdays and clowns. Clowns?! Why the hell am I thinking about clowns?!?\u201d And so my internal monologue continues until 3:00, 4:00, or even 6:00 A.M ., rotating through images, ideas, commitments, anxieties, and fantasies. This mental slide show is combined with perverse sleep yoga: sometimes the twisted- into-a-pretzel posture, sometimes lying on my back like Dracula in mock-paralysis, and always ending in the fetal position with a pillow or arm between my knees. Fetal position never works, but I continue to try it, like a full- bladdered dog scratching at a door that never opens. I have insomnia. Horrific \u201conset\u201d insomnia. My father and my brother are the same. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re stressed out, necessarily, it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not tired. It\u2019s because we just can\u2019t freaking fall asleep. So, in the interest of finally getting a good night\u2019s rest and helping others with insomnia, I tried everything from folk remedies to smart drugs, from light therapy to fat loading. Now I can say that I had chronic insomnia. The Hidden Third of Life Is good sleep a simple matter of length, the longer the better? If you\u2019ve ever needed a nap after sleeping too much, you know it isn\u2019t that simple. Let\u2019s look at the problem through an easier question: what is bad sleep? \u2022 Taking too long to get to sleep (\u201conset\u201d insomnia, my major Page 338 problem) \u2022 Waking too often throughout the night (\u201cmiddle\u201d insomnia) \u2022 Waking too early and being unable to get back to sleep (\u201cterminal\u201d insomnia) The challenge for a self-tracker is measuring things when drooling into a pillow. I could record the times when I got into bed and when I woke up, but I couldn\u2019t pinpoint when I fell asleep, much less what happened while asleep. Taking courses like \u201cBiology of Sleep\u201d at Stanford University didn\u2019t fix my insomnia, but the academic searching did help me formulate more specific questions, including: \u2022 For memory consolidation: how much REM sleep am I experiencing? \u2022 For tissue repair: how much delta-wave sleep am I experiencing? \u2022 For both of the above: am I experiencing sleep apnea?

    "text": "wires attached to you to measure brain activity (EEG), eye movements (EOG), skeletal muscle activation (EMG), heart rhythm (ECG), respiration, and sometimes peripheral pulse oximetry. Guess what? No one can sleep in a weird lab with 22 wires attached to them on the first night. So the data are terrible. But let\u2019s assume you try. The second night, you come in after an all-nighter and crash within minutes like a post\u2013sugar high two-year-old. Double-bad data. To really test and tweak things under realistic sleeping conditions, I would need a pocket-sized sleep lab. That didn\u2019t happen until 2009. My First F*cking Sleep Lab JULY 2009 \u201cYou should try what Brad Feld used. He has some gadget to measure your Page 339 sleep,\u201d offered one of my friends. This caught my attention. I had been bitching about my insomnia after another horrible night\u2019s sleep, and I\u2019d also been meaning to reach out to Brad. Based out of beautiful Boulder, Colorado, Brad is a venture capitalist and angel investor famous for (1) his incredible track record and (2) dropping F- bombs on business panels. 1 Exhibit A: He was one of the few initial backers of Harmonix Music Systems, which he helped raise $500,000 in financing. They bled money for almost 11 years. A fool\u2019s errand! Then, in 2005, it had a small (sarcasm) video game success called \u201cGuitar Hero.\u201d It sold in 2006 to Viacom/MTV for $175 million. Brad\u2019s contrarian decisions often follow an elegant logic that others only pick up on well after the fact. If he had found a tool for sleep analysis, I wanted to know all about it. Of Motion and Waves: The Tools Brad\u2019s obsession ended up being the Zeo. It would be my first legitimate, next- generation sleep gadget. Then I added more gadgets. In the subsequent four months of testing, I also used heart-rate monitors, thermometers, continuous glucose monitors, two movement-detection devices (FitBit and WakeMate), and video recording of sleep movement. Often all simultaneously. I looked like a comatose Robocop. Both WakeMate and FitBit, worn on your wrist during sleep, use motion- sensing technology (accelerometry) similar to what\u2019s found in a Nintendo Wii controller. The data are interpreted using actigraphy algorithms, which are used to determine whether someone is awake or in one of the various stages of sleep. WakeMate features an alarm clock that can be set to wake you during specific \u201carousal points\u201d in REM sleep (ostensibly to minimize grogginess) up to 30 minutes before a chosen wake time. Page 341 The Zeo, in contrast, uses a headband that measures electrical patterns generated in the brain. It also has an alarm clock intended to wake you during periods of most elevated brain activity to minimize grogginess. The first attempts to track and fix things were not encouraging. For both accelerometer devices, time to fall asleep\u2014the critical problem of \u201conset\u201d insomnia\u2014did not appear accurate. Despite claims to the contrary, it didn\u2019t appear that the accelerometers could distinguish between simple lack of movement and sleeping. I tested this by watching television for 30 minutes, remaining as perfectly still as possible before attempting to sleep. My \u201csleep\u201d started roughly when I started watching TV. Page 342 The first good news came a week later: the intelligent alarms, Zeo and WakeMate, seemed to reduce grogginess. I was less bastardly in the morning and could think without two cups of coffee. Placebo or true cause and effect, the \u201csmart alarms\u201d seemed to help. This was an improvement, but I needed better sleep, not just better wake times. This is where the Zeo really became valuable. I began with a trial period of answering a subjective question each morning and assigning a number: do I feel like shit (1\u20133) or do I feel awesome (8\u201310)? Nebulous answers between 4 and 7 that would skew interpretation were logged but ignored. In both extreme ranges, I then looked for patterns. Thanks to the continuous glucose monitoring, I also had food logs to use. Page 343 Here"

    "text": "are some of the initial findings: 1. Good sleep (8\u201310) was most dependent on the ratio of REM-to-total sleep, not total REM duration. The higher the percentage of REM sleep, the more restful the sleep. The higher the REM percentage, the better the recall of skills or data acquired in the previous 24 hours. Higher-percentage REM sleep also correlated to lower average pulse and temperature upon waking. 2. I could increase REM percentage by extending total sleep time past nine hours, or by waking for five minutes approximately four and a half hours after sleep onset. One waking of 5\u201310 minutes, approximately four and a half hours after sleep onset, dramatically increased REM percentage. It seems that one waking is not necessarily a bad thing, at least when intentional. 3. Taking 200 milligrams of huperzine-A 30 minutes before bed can increase total REM by 20 \u201330%. Huperzine-A, an extract of Huperzia serrata , slows the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. 2 It is a popular nootropic (smart drug), and I have used it in the past to accelerate learning and increase the incidence of lucid dreaming. I now only use huperzine-A for the first few weeks of language acquisition, and no more than three days per week to avoid side effects. Ironically, one documented side effect of overuse is insomnia. The brain is a sensitive instrument, and while generally well tolerated, this drug is contraindicated with some classes of medications. Speak with your doctor before Page 344 using. 4. The higher the percentage of deep-wave sleep, the better your subsequent physical performance. 5. More than two glasses of wine within four hours of sleep decreases deep- wave sleep 20\u201350%. Even four glasses six hours beforehand did not appear to have this effect, so the timing is crucial. Conversely, taking 15+ drops of California poppy extract appeared to increase deep-wave sleep up to 20%. 6. Eating two tablespoons of organic almond butter on celery sticks before bed eliminated at least 50% of the \u201cfeel like shit\u201d (1\u20133) mornings. Ever wonder how you can sleep 8\u201310 hours and feel tired? The likely culprit: low blood sugar. Make a pre-bed snack part of your nutritional program. One to two tablespoons of flaxseed oil (120\u2013240 calories) can be used in combination with the celery-and-almond-butter to further increase cell repair during sleep and thus decrease fatigue. Flaxseed oil tastes like a mixture of raccoon urine and asparagus, so\u2014if you opt to include it\u2014I recommend pinching your nose while consuming it, per Dr. Seth Roberts, whom we\u2019ll meet later. Turning Off Monkey Mind Next, I moved on to the biggest problem: getting to sleep in the first place. No matter how theoretically restful my sleep should be, based on Zeo results, more than 30 minutes of onset insomnia negated it all. What follows are the changes and tools that had the largest effects on time-to- sleep. Some of them are more convenient than others. I excluded drugs 3 from testing, and if a given improvement couldn\u2019t be replicated at least three times on consecutive nights, it was omitted. TEST 67\u201370\u00b0 AS YOUR BEDROOM TEMPERATURE. This was the variable I experimented with the most while in Nicaragua for my medical tourism adventures (coming up later), and it was also the variable that had the most consistent effects. Specifically, using a single bedsheet at a room temperature between 67\u00b0F and 70\u00b0F produced the fastest time to sleep. Warmer temperatures never worked, but as low as 65\u00b0F would work equally well if I wore socks to keep my feet warm. If you can\u2019t control the ambient temperature, testing socks of different thicknesses is the easiest variable to change for tweaking heat loss. Page 345 Ideal temperature is highly individual, and each person will have a narrow range, so experiment to find your own. EAT A LARGE FAT- AND PROTEIN-DOMINATED MEAL WITHIN THREE HOURS OF BEDTIME.

    "text": "getting under the sheets, meals of at least 800 milligrams of cholesterol (four or more large whole eggs) and 40 grams of protein produced dramatically faster time-to-sleep scores than meals of lower volume or lower protein and fat. Eating two rib-eye steaks, each about three-quarters of a pound, had the strongest tranquilizer-like effect. USE LIGHT CUES \u2013 THE PHILIPS GOLITE. I bought this high-end blue-light emitter for a friend who suffers from seasonal affective disorder (SAD)\u2014aka mild to severe depression during winter months. He already owned the same device, so I began to use it as a replacement for coffee first thing in the morning. I set it to the side of my laptop, pointing at me for 15 minutes at about a 30-degree off-center angle (if noon is my laptop, pointing at me from 10 A.M . or 2 P.M .). That evening, my time to sleep was less than 10 minutes for the first time in weeks. I was able to replicate the effect four nights out of five. Though most often used for jet lag or winter depression, I\u2019ve found the goLITE to be singularly most useful as a corrective sleep tool, even if I wake up late and need to go to bed at a normal hour. Battery life is long and, at the size of a small square book, the goLITE is portable enough to fit in a carry-on travel bag. TAX THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH ISO-LATERAL MOVEMENTS. Exercise is commonly recommended to improve sleep. The problem for me was that results were unpredictable. I might exercise for 20 minutes and fall asleep in 10 minutes, or I might exercise for two hours and fall asleep in two hours. There was no repeatable cause and effect. It seemed like a coin toss. This changed when I began to incorporate iso-lateral (one-arm or one-leg) resistance training. I logged faster to-sleep times after 8 out of 10 training sessions. The more complex the stabilization required, the shorter the to-sleep time. To experience this effect for yourself, do a single session of pre-hab testing from the \u201cPre-Hab\u201d chapter. TAKE A COLD BATH ONE HOUR PRIOR TO BED. Page 346 The Japanese have longer average lifespans than most other nationalities, including Americans, whom they beat by more than four years. One explanation researchers have proposed is that the regular ofuro , or hot bath at bedtime, increases melatonin release and is related to mechanisms for life extension. Paradoxically, according to one of the Stanford professors who taught the sleep biology class I took circa 2002, cold is a more effective signaler (aka zeitgeber , or \u201ctime giver\u201d) for sleep onset. Perhaps the ofuro effect was related to the subsequent rapid cooling? Not eager to kill my swimmies with hot baths, I opted for direct cold. I tested the effect of combining shorter-than-usual 10-minute ice baths with low-dose melatonin (1.5\u20133 milligrams) one hour prior to sleep. The ice bath is simple: put two to three bags of ice from a convenience store ($3\u20136) into a half- full bathtub until the ice is about 80% melted. Beginners should start by immersing the lower body only and progress to spending the second five minutes with the upper torso submerged as well, keeping the hands out of the water. (See \u201cIce Age\u201d for other approaches and benefits.) It was like getting hit with an elephant tranquilizer. Best of all, this was true even when melatonin is omitted. USE AN ULTRASONIC HUMIDIFIER. The Air-O-Swiss Travel Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier is incredible. It is small enough to fit in a jacket pocket (1.3 pounds), and its water source comes from any convenience store: a plastic water bottle turned upside down. The ultrasonic technology uses high-frequency vibrations to generate a micro-fine cool mist, which is blown into the room, where it evaporates into the air. This device is my go-to combination with the goLITE, especially after seeing how well it eliminates sinus problems while traveling. It also dramatically reduces facial wrinkles, which was an unexpected but pleasant side effect. The Air-O-Swiss humidifier comes with a"

My only complaint: it emits a stylish (but distracting) blue glow, so you\u2019ll need an eye-mask if you\u2019re light-sensitive like I am. USE A NIGHTWAVE PULSE LIGHT. The NightWave was introduced to me by a good friend named Michael, who also has severe onset insomnia. During my testing, he started ranting and raving about this tiny device, a slow- pulsing light the size of a cigarette pack that helped him get to sleep in less than Page 347 seven minutes. Dr. James B. Maas, Weiss Presidential Fellow and professor of psychology at Cornell University, is one of several researchers who have endorsed it. From the NightWave website: NightWave projects a soft blue light into your darkened bedroom. The \u201cluminance\u201d of the light slowly rises and falls. Lie with eyes open and synchronize your breathing with the blue wave as its movement becomes slower and slower. After a short time [the cycle Michael used was seven minutes long], NightWave shuts off and you roll over and fall asleep \u2026 unlike sound machines, the soft light does not disturb others. It does work, but I found it less consistent than Michael did (his hit rate was near 100%). I now travel with the NightWave but use it as a supplement to the goLITE when needed. RESORT TO THE HALF MILITARY CRAWL POSITION. Lie on your chest with your head on a pillow and turned to the right. Both arms Page 348 should be straight by your sides, palms up. Now bring your right arm up until the top of your right elbow is bent at 90 degrees and your hand is close to your head. Alternative hand placement: the right hand is under your pillow and under your head. Next, bring your right knee out to that side until it is bent at approximately 90 degrees. This is a last resort that works for one simple reason: you can\u2019t move. It\u2019s like a self-imposed papoose, which the Inuits and other cultures have used to calm infants by immobilizing them. To toss and turn from the half military crawl position, you have to first lift your entire body off the bed. Less fidgeting means faster sleep. TOOLS AND TRICKS F.lux ( http://stereopsis.com/flux/ ) It\u2019s possible that your computer screen is what\u2019s keeping you awake. F.lux is a free computer application that dims your computer screen when the sun sets. In the morning, it makes the screen return to its default sunlight-like settings.

The Zeo uses a headband that measures electrical patterns generated in the brain and can wake you at a point of elevated brain activity. It was the only recording device that offered usable data and that consistently reduced grogginess.

Page 351 BECOMING UBERMAN Sleeping Less with Polyphasic Sleep Death, so called, is a thing which makes men weep, And yet a third of life is passed in sleep. \u2014Lord Byron They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler Durden? \u2014Fight Club S cientists know embarrassingly little about why we spend roughly one-third of our lives asleep. It can\u2019t be as simple as tissue repair. Full-grown giraffes, as one example, weigh approximately 1,760 pounds but sleep an average of just 1.9 hours per 24- hour cycle. Eight hours per night doesn\u2019t apply to most of the animal kingdom. Is there any reason why humans can\u2019t emulate giraffes? Is it possible to cut your total sleep time in half, yet feel completely refreshed? The short answer is yes. In 1996, I once went almost five days without sleep to see (1) if I could make it a week (I couldn\u2019t), and (2) what the side effects would be. Hallucinations cut that little experiment short, but I\u2019ve continued to play with different patterns of sleep cycles. One of the most fascinating approaches is that of \u201cpolyphasic\u201d sleep: breaking sleep up into multiple segments so you can perform well with as little as two hours of sleep per day. The potential advantages of this schedule for new parents \u2014or anyone else forced to embrace insufficient sleep\u2014are tremendous. Beyond that, think of the books you could read, the things you could learn, the adventures you could have with an extra six hours per day. It would open up a new world of possibilities. There are hundreds, if not thousands, who swear by the Thomas Edison approach to minimalist sleep, which bears little resemblance to \u201csleep\u201d as you know it. I have used both the \u201cEveryman\u201d and \u201cSiesta,\u201d detailed in this chapter, with great success. I reserve anything resembling \u201cUberman\u201d for emergency deadlines only. To explain the options and pitfalls of each, I\u2019ll let a more experienced polyphasic sleeper, Dustin Curtis, tell you his story. Page 352 Enter Dustin Curtis My body is incompatible with Earth. It has a daily sleep-wake cycle that lasts about 28 hours instead of 24, which means each day I stay awake about four hours longer than most people. In the middle of the week, I sometimes find myself waking up at 11:00 P.M . and going to bed in the early afternoon the next day. When I was younger, people thought I was insane. The only thing I remember of elementary school is being tired. Eventually, I discovered that if I stuck to a 28-hour schedule, my body was happy. I woke up rested, went to sleep tired, and everything worked great. Except that, well, my life was incompatible with the rest of the world. Living with a normal schedule was going to be tough, so I had to find a solution. After some research, I discovered that what I probably have is called non-24- hour sleep-wake syndrome. The solution is polyphasic sleep, which anyone can use to shave six hours off their normal sleeping time (with a catch, of course). HELLO, POLYPHASIC SLEEP\u2026 The basic premise of polyphasic sleep is that the most beneficial phase of sleep is the REM phase. Normal sleepers"

    "text": "experience REM for a mere 1\u20132 hours per night. To reap the benefits of polyphasic sleep, we\u2019ll need to engineer things so that REM is a much higher percentage of total sleep. One of the ways to force your brain into REM sleep and skip the other phases is to make it feel exhausted. If you\u2019ve gone 24 hours without sleep, you might notice that you drift away into dreams straight from being awake. This is because your body goes instantly into REM sleep as a protection mechanism. The way to hack yourself into entering REM sleep without being exhausted is to trick your body into thinking you\u2019re going to get a tiny amount of sleep. You can train it to enter REM for short periods of time throughout the day in 20-minute naps rather than in one lump at night. This is how polyphasic sleep works. There are actually six good methods to choose from. The first one, monophasic sleep, is the way you\u2019ve probably slept your whole life. The five others are quite a bit more interesting. With monophasic sleep , you sleep for eight hours and you get about two hours of good REM sleep . This is the normal schedule most people use, and it means about five hours of the night are lost to (as far as we know) unnecessary unconsciousness. There are five methods for polyphasic sleep that all focus on many 20-minute Page 353 naps throughout the day and, in some cases, a couple hours of core sleep at night. The simplest is the \u201cSiesta\u201d method, which includes just one nap in the day and then a huge chunk of sleep at night. Remarkably, adding just one nap during the day shaves an hour and 40 minutes off your total sleep requirement. The \u201cEveryman\u201d method is just a stepped ladder that offers different combinations of naps and core sleep. The amount of total sleep per day is drastically reduced for each extra nap you add. The \u201cUberman\u201d method, coined by PureDoxyk, has six naps and no core sleep. Amazingly, you can function with just two total hours of sleep using the Uberman method. Page 354 THE CATCH How awesome would it be to sleep a total of two hours a day and feel rested? Very awesome, of course, but there is a catch. The more naps you have (and thus the less sleep you have total), the more rigorous you have to be regarding your nap times. You can\u2019t miss a nap by more than a couple hours in the Everyman 2 and Everyman 3 methods, and you must have your naps within 30 minutes of their scheduled times for the Uberman method. If you miss a nap, the whole schedule is thrown off, and you\u2019ll feel tired for days. The rigor of keeping the schedule makes most of these methods unrealistic for 9-to-5 employees. But if you have a flexible schedule and can manage to pick a method and stick with it for several months, you\u2019ll find that you feel amazing and have a seemingly unlimited amount of time during the day to get things done. This, to me, is the ultimate brain hack. Step #1: Determine your sleep schedule. You will be taking 20-minute naps, every four hours, around the clock. That\u2019s six naps, evenly spaced over the course of 24 hours (e.g., 2:00 A . M ., 6:00 A . M ., 10:00 A . M ., 2:00 P . M ., 6:00 P . M ., and 10:00 P . M .). This cycle will remain the same throughout your polyphasic sleeping period. Step #2: Do NOT oversleep . By oversleeping just once, you\u2019ll upset the cycle and feel exhausted (for up to 24 hours) as a result. Under no circumstances should you sleep more than 20 minutes, as it can ultimately cause you to abandon the polyphasic schedule out of fatigue. Get a reliable alarm clock. If you\u2019re tempted to hit the snooze button, put the clock far away from where you sleep. Step #3: Do NOT skip naps. Respect your schedule and follow it to the minute. Skipping them will have a compounding effect. Missing one nap results in a loss of energy that requires two more naps to return you to normal mental sharpness. Step #4: Beat the initiation phase. The first week and a half is the toughest. If you follow your outlined schedule, don\u2019t oversleep, and don\u2019t skip"

For lack of other decorations, I ended up fixating on the colon like a candle flame while I had three-inch needles stuck into my neck, shoulders, and ankles. The first needle grazed my cervical spine, and I began to sweat. That was just the warm-up. Within two hours, I set the clinic record for single-visit injections. Setting the clinic injection record. There were two additional sessions over the next eight days, and I traveled the full spectrum of emotions, including abject terror. The needle taps on my spine, done to elicit additional growth factor release, sounded like small scratches on a blackboard. Less than an hour later, I watched on in perverse amusement (the cumulative anesthetic of 10+ shots helped) as a syringe inserted in one side of my left ankle began to dance underneath the skin on the opposite side like a chest-popping fetus from Aliens . It then poked through the skin, and I was less amused. Not a party trick you want to show your patients. We used everything but the kitchen sink. The most potent of the chemical cocktails was a hybrid. It combined the ingredients used on the knees of an Olympic skier with the ingredients used on one sprinter who\u2019d torn his Achilles tendon eight weeks prior to the world championships. The latter ended up winning a gold medal. Page 360 The final Frankenstein elixir was serious business. It included: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) PRP is an emerging treatment mainly used with elite athletes. It gained national attention in 2009 when used successfully to treat two Pittsburgh Steelers just weeks prior to their Super Bowl victory. PRP contains the plasma portion of your blood with concentrated platelets. Platelets are packed with growth and healing factors and are part of the body\u2019s normal tissue repair system. The PRP is prepared using a special centrifuge after whole blood is drawn from your arm, similar to getting blood drawn for lab work. Making platelet-rich plasma. PRP formed the base to which the following were added: Stem cell factor (SCF), flown in from Israel, which assists in blood cell production. Bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP-7), which helps adult stem cells (mesenchymal) develop into bone and cartilage. In retrospect, I believe this to be the most dangerous substance in all of the cocktails I tried. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) IGF-1 has anabolic (tissue-building) effects in adults and is produced in the liver after stimulation by growth hormone. It is one of the most potent natural activators of cell growth and multiplication. It is also an expensive drug used at the higher levels of professional bodybuilding. Page 361 Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) So what happened? The end result four months later, according to the world-class Harvard-trained spine specialist who looked at the before-and-after MRIs, was: \u201cI could not appreciate any before-and-after differences.\u201d Now, there might have been microscopic changes (cytokines, etc.), but the MRIs reflected my pain: no change. The three sessions had cost more than $7,000, and not only was the experience expensive, it ended up being a disaster. One of the injections in my right elbow resulted in a staph infection and emergency surgery at the University of California\u2013San Francisco Medical Center, almost two months of limited arm use, and more than $10,000 in hospital expenses. When I contacted the sports scientist responsible for the injections to ask for $1,500 to help defray the costs, the e-mail response was as unorthodox as the treatment: Why would you even waste your time asking me for this when you can just go out and make far more money? Wow. In scientific parlance, the whole thing was a total cluster-fuck.

How then can you, the reader, with no desire to waste $7,000 \u201320,000, weed out the junk science and charlatans? Page 362 The least painful option is to let a human guinea pig test them all for you. That\u2019s my job. The Reasons First things first: why the hell would I do this to myself? It\u2019s quite simple. There is a price to be paid for all of the envelope- pushing I\u2019ve done over 15+ years. Namely, more than 20 fractures and 20 dislocations, two joint surgeries (shoulder and, now, elbow), and enough tears and sprains to last a lifetime. Decades of full-contact abuse and overconfidence in all sports ending in \u201c-boarding\u201d has made me, as one orthopedic surgeon put it, \u201ca 30- year-old in a 60-year-old body.\u201d Though it was a depressing and fatalist diagnosis, it didn\u2019t appear uncommon. My closest male friends, also former competitive athletes, had all started creaking and groaning after age 30. The aches were turning into surgeries, small training injuries had become chronic pain, and we all recognized the pink elephant in the room: it was going to get worse. Much worse. For me, the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was a series of high-dose prednisone prescriptions and epidural injections in 2009. It started with an innocuous shoulder impingement. MRIs showed no shoulder issues but uncovered cervical spine degeneration in five discs. \u201cThis is something you\u2019ll just need to live with\u201d was the concluding remark, delivered with an inappropriate smile, from a spine surgeon who works with NHL and NFL teams. None of his recommended drugs or injections would fix the problem. They were nothing more than Band-Aids designed to mask symptoms, to dull the senses. I had graduated to terminal pain management. My second day on prednisone, a strong immunosuppressant drug, I spent the entire afternoon stumbling around the Mission district in SF in a daze, looking for a car I\u2019d parked just an hour earlier. I gave up after three hours and took a cab to a dinner meeting. The next morning, I woke up looking like a pug and couldn\u2019t remember who I\u2019d had dinner with. Enough was enough. If conventional medicine couldn\u2019t fix the problem, it was time for more drastic measures. If I was going to fix one thing, I wanted to fix them all. Page 363 The Menu Looking at the ultimate results (what worked and what didn\u2019t) I could have saved myself a lot of expense by following a four-stage approach. Only when options in the first stage fail do you proceed to stage two, and so forth, up to the final stage and last resort: surgical repair. Stage #1\u2014Movement: Correcting posture and biomechanics through specific movements Stage #2\u2014Manipulation: Correcting soft-tissue damage or adhesion using tools or pressure with the hands Stage #3\u2014Medication: Ingesting, injecting, or applying medication Stage #4\u2014Mechanical reconstruction: Surgical repair Below is just a small sample of the approaches I tested for this book during a five-month period in 2009, as well as following shoulder reconstruction in 2004 (which accounts for most of the intramuscular injections). Injections were performed with blood test reviews every two to four weeks. Part of the drive to experiment was fueled by positive experience: I knew what was possible. Post-surgery in 2004, I used a careful combination of therapies that produced incredible results: my surgically repaired shoulder ended up superior to my uninjured \u201chealthy\u201d shoulder. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to not just restore but exceed previous capabilities, making you \u201cbetter than new.\u201d It can be life-changing.

There were just five treatments that reversed \u201cpermanent\u201d injuries, either as 1\u20133 sessions or as viable solo exercises. Here they are: 1. SHOE HEEL REMOVAL AND VIBRAM TRAINING. AREA FIXED: LOWER BACK. Ugly, and ultimately painful, postural compensation is unavoidable when wearing shoes that elevate the heels. This simple observation somehow escaped me for 30 years, until CrossFit Chicago instructor Rudy Tapalla introduced me to Vibram Five Finger shoes, which look like gloves for your feet. Chronic use of high-heeled shoes usually results in some degree of kyphosis- lordosis and related pains in the lower back and mid-upper back. Kyphosis- lordosis, seen in the second illustration to the right, is posture characterized by \u201cconvex curvature of the thoracic spine and an inwardly curved lower back resulting from the pelvis being tilted forward.\u201d This is an academic way of saying hunchbacked and swaybacked at the same time. This is how both men and women with less than 10% bodyfat can end up looking potbellied. It\u2019s the overarching of the low back, not excessive bodyfat, that causes this unfortunate optical illusion. Page 366 The fix is simple: most of the time, wear flats or shoes with little difference in sole thickness from toe to heel. Shifting to wearing Vibram Five Fingers \u00ae and Terra Plana Barefoot Vivo shoes completely erased low-back pain I\u2019d suffered from for more than 10 years. To the degree it was possible, the Vibrams also helped restore my feet. Restore to what? Their natural condition, illustrated below in the first set of photos, published in the American Journal of Orthopedic Surgery in 1905. In barefoot walkers, the toes fan out, providing a stable base for walking. Notice the natural outward line from the center of the heel to the big toe, which prevents excessive pronation (rolling of the feet inward) and related problems in the knees and lower back. Page 367 Much like in Chinese foot binding, the feet of this modern man have conformed to his shoes. The outward line from heel to big toe is nonexistent. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Used on occasion, a nice set of heels can really accentuate the female form and give fellas some style and height. Just use the elevation in moderation. 2. THE EGOSCUE METHOD. AREAS FIXED: CERVICAL/NECK AND MID-BACK. Peter Egoscue (pronounced \u201cEg- os -cue,\u201d not \u201c E go-scue\u201d) is the founder of the Egoscue Method, a postural therapy program with 24 clinics worldwide. Peter is a former marine and self-taught therapist who became famous through experimentation on himself and athletes. One of his early experiences is lore among his trainers: Pete found"

    "text": "himself in the locker room of a professional wrestler after the athlete had sprained his ankle. Peter, only at the event because the producer was his friend, had the wrestler lie on the floor and place his extended and injured leg on top of a locker door. Unsure of what to do, he chose elevation. Pete then got a phone call and walked out, only to return 15 minutes later. The wrestler stated in no uncertain terms that the elevation had been a complete waste of time. His ankle still felt the same. But, for whatever reason, his chronic back pain felt better. Pete asked himself a simple question: \u201cwhy?\u201d He then repeated and refined this unusual locker-room stretch until its success rate for back pain was impressive enough to warrant a formal name. It became the rather obscene- sounding \u201csupine groin progressive,\u201d which I later fell in love with. Decades later, he still emphasizes the fundamental importance of basic questioning at Egoscue University: \u201cStudents, in my world, because I know nothing, everything is possible.\u201d For me, the Egoscue Method was not love at first sight. Page 368 I had been exposed to Egoscue on half a dozen occasions via athletes before testing it myself in 2009. I held off for as long as I did because the early exposure left me with an aftertaste of cult. Testimonials claimed everything from disappearing allergies to self-healing digestive problems, and I was shown videos of trainees going into full-body involuntary spasms like grand mal seizures during certain \u201ce-cises\u201d (exercises). I decided I was just fine without a Pentecostal brand of Pilates. If I wanted to squeeze my pelvic floor while swinging a dead cat over my head, I could do that on my own. So I ignored the Egoscue Method, despite endorsements from golf legend Jack Nicklaus and Super Bowl ring\u2013sporting NFL players like John Lynch. Then, in June 2009, I found myself in Tempe, Arizona, eating lunch with a friend who was scheduled for an Egoscue session that very afternoon with John Cattermole, a well-respected and seasoned practitioner with 25 years of physical therapy experience. I agreed to accompany him and undergo an evaluation, fully prepared for a nice dose of voodoo. Instead, I walked out 90 minutes later with no pain in my mid-back for the first time in six months. I couldn\u2019t believe it. It would be one of many times that I slapped myself for prematurely throwing out the baby with the bathwater. This experience also reconfirmed two truisms: (1) some practitioners of any method will get the message wrong and broadcast it, creating confusion as representatives, and (2) it\u2019s critical, as Bruce Lee emphasized, to \u201cabsorb what is useful, discard what is useless, and add what is uniquely your own.\u201d Based on several months of testing myself and other laptop hunchers, I can recommend six 80/20 exercises for desk-dwellers\u2019 postural imbalances. For the minimalists who work at home (or who have understanding coworkers), I suggest performing #1, #2, and #3 after every two or three hours at a desk or in a sitting position and performing all five movements at least once per week. The supine groin progressive, the most inconvenient, unusual, and time- consuming of the five, is the singular most effective tool I\u2019ve found for eliminating psoas and other hip flexor tightness to unlock the pelvis and relieve hamstring tightness. 1.

From Mexico to Miami, we\u2019d seen a lot and spent more than $100,000 already. Few things paid off. \u201cDr. Two Fingers\u201d was Seabiscuit\u2019s single best find, and I received a text Page 376 message to that effect, which ended with: \u201cMate, you need to break something just so Dr. Two Fingers can fix you. Trust me.\u201d I\u2019d already taken care of the breaking things, so I booked a flight to Salt Lake City and drove almost an hour to the small Mormon-dominated town of Kaysville, where the ChiroMAT office of Craig Buhler\u2014\u201cDr. Two Fingers\u201d\u2014is located.

Buhler approached injuries differently than most. Unlike the majority of therapists, who treat the tight or painful muscles and joints themselves (i.e., sore lower back? \u2192 work on the lower back; painful Achilles? \u2192 rehab the Achilles), Buhler\u2019s sought to unpeel the onion of proprioception , how the nervous system, in this case, turns muscles on or off. Seabiscuit had nicknamed Buhler \u201cDr. Two Fingers\u201d because of his unusual approach to isolating and reactivating individual muscles that had been injured or deactivated. For his highest-level athletes, this could be done for up to 700 muscles. With one finger pressed deep into the end of a given muscle (a tendon insertion point) and another finger of the opposite hand pressed into the opposite end, he would progress through a series of tests to return a dormant muscle to its previous function. From a brochure at his clinic: We have found that when a body part is overloaded or stressed past its capacity to handle the load, there is a predictable result. Either the muscle or connective tissue is injured, or the proprioceptive system deactivates parts of the tissue, much like a circuit breaker in an electrical circuit. The body adapts, recruiting other muscles to take over the load. With repetition, the adaption advances. Recruited tissues get stronger, impaired areas atrophy. It didn\u2019t take long to demonstrate this \u201creactivation\u201d in practice. Dr. Two Fingers first tested the strength of my supraspinatus (the most commonly injured rotator cuff muscle) using an FET force sensor, showed that I had the strength of Dakota Fanning, and then proceeded to reactivate it, more than quadrupling my Page 377 strength. I went from lifting 6 pounds to lifting 28 pounds in less than five minutes. \u201cDo you have pain at the bottom of your right Achilles tendon?\u201d Buhler asked. He hadn\u2019t even looked at this location, and he had pinpointed one of my most serious problem areas. He could see I was confused, so he explained: \u201cYour gastrocnemius [calf] isn\u2019t firing properly\u2014it\u2019s turned off\u2014so it makes sense that you have Achilles and knee pain, and most likely referral pain in your hamstring.\u201d And so he continued, proving again and again that what I thought was the problem wasn\u2019t the problem. It was a muscle that had taken over for another muscle, which had taken over for yet another muscle. The original muscular deactivation could be on the opposite side of the body, nowhere near the site of pain. His spotting ability was incredible. One world-class powerlifter who\u2019d visited Buhler shared an anecdote from his first visit: \u201cHe hadn\u2019t even touched me and he announced that I had weak quads. I responded back with \u2018Weak quads?! I deadlift 900 pounds!\u2019 to which Craig just shrugged and went to work.\u201d The lifter later reviewed slow-motion footage of his pulling technique in competition and realized that, undeniably, his technique clearly indicated he was straightening his legs quickly to compensate for weak quadriceps. Time spent with Dr. Two Fingers added up. Fifty dollars per muscle reactivated means that function doesn\u2019t come cheap. I had a total of four sessions and covered more than 50 muscles. I couldn\u2019t accept all of his supplemental programs, but I knew that exploring the fringes required casting a wide net. To find the few things that worked, it was sometimes necessary to bite your tongue and withstand things you knew didn\u2019t work, even within the same offices. In the end, I tested his treatments with the only jury that really mattered: objective weights. The changes were not subtle. Take the pectorals, for instance. Since fracturing both collarbones in my teens, I have had disproportionate trouble recruiting the chest, making the bench press and similar"

Twenty-four hours after the session, I performed slow decline flies with 50- Page 378 pound dumbbells (20% increase) for 14 repetitions (180% increase). Incredible. Before you aim to improve a muscle\u2019s output (weight or repetitions lifted) by increasing size, it\u2019s important to ensure that the input (neural system) is functioning properly. Do you really need \u201cstronger muscles,\u201d or is the wiring just not conducting the signal properly? If you can\u2019t make a trip to Dr. Two Fingers, see the MAT resources at the end of this chapter for a local option. 4. ACTIVE-RELEASE TECHNIQUE (ART). AREA FIXED: SHOULDER INTERNAL ROTATORS. Dr. P. Michael Leahy\u2019s engineering education began with aeronautics in the air force. His fascination with structural mechanics only fully expressed itself much later, in 1985. This was the year ART was formalized and patented, the year he applied his engineering to human soft-tissue injuries. Leahy, a veteran of 25 Ironman triathlons, has since been doctor to, among others, Olympic gold-medal sprinter Donovan Bailey, Gary Roberts of the NHL Toronto Maple Leafs, and Mr. Universe Milos Sarcev. The basic premise of the method is simple: shorten the tissue, apply manual tension, and then lengthen the tissue or make it slide relative to its adjacent tissue. Simple does not mean easy; as Leahy explains, \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as playing a piano and just as difficult.\u201d What does this look like in practice? If muscles are adhered to one another or to bone, it looks a lot like tearing muscles apart. See the visual preview below. Getting manhandled. I first encountered ART in 2001 through Frank Shamrock, five-time Page 379 middleweight Ultimate Fighting (UFC) champion. Frank had his first ART treatment in July 2001 following an acute lower back injury during training. He was unable to walk and didn\u2019t expect much: I had seen more than 30 chiropractors throughout the world over a 16-year period for lower back pain and numbness in my leg. With the training injury that prompted my visit, I couldn\u2019t raise my head above waist-level, and I was sleeping on the living room floor in the fetal position. I had always been told one of two things by orthopedists and various MDs: I would need to have my vertebrae fused, or simply tolerate the pain of an injury that was irreversible. Based on past experience, I was certain that I would need to cancel the K-1 kickboxing fight I had scheduled for one month later. In four sessions of approximately 10 minutes each, the doctors at the Janzen & Janzen Sports Health Clinic in San Jose, California, eliminated the cumulative scar tissue and adhesions that had created the pain in Frank\u2019s lower back. He was carried out of the gym on his trainer\u2019s shoulders on Thursday and was training at 100% the following Tuesday. Three weeks later, Frank won his K-1 fight by first-round KO. Frank then recommended ART to B. J. Penn, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu World Champion, who used ART to restore full range of motion to his left shoulder (preventing surgery), right shoulder, and hamstring, among other areas. Two weeks prior to the November 2, 2001, UFC championship, B. J. Penn\u2019s lower back pain was treated successfully in two 15-minute sessions. B.J. proceeded to knock out a heavily favored Caol Uno in just 11 seconds of the first round. Experimenting with ART Flash-forward to an overcast and dreary afternoon in New York City, December 2009. Freezing rain was falling in sheets outside of the Peak Performance gym where 20 or so strength trainers, coaches, and I had been taking an all-day seminar on PIMST (Poliquin Instant Muscle Strengthening Technique), developed by professional and Olympic trainer Charles Poliquin. For each diagnostic and training exercise, we paired off with partners and tested range of motion. For the first exercise, we\u2019d looked at both"

    "text": "external and internal shoulder rotation (for the latter, imagine the motion of arm wrestling or pitching a Page 380 baseball). My external rotation was excellent, but my internal rotation was so close to immobile that my partner thought I was joking: \u201cWow. You\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t kidding. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d been able to touch most of my back. Reminded of this handicap and a bit demoralized, I approached Charles during a break to ask him for recommendations. He paused for a second and looked at me: \u201cWould you like me to fix it?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. \u201cThat would be incredible\u201d was all I could get out. Charles led me to a massage table on one side of the gym and asked me to lie down. He gathered all of the students for a demonstration of removing adhesions and restrictions. Quite the demonstration it was. Though I was the weakest male in the entire group, the big boys and Westside- style powerlifters had more respect for me 20 minutes later. It was clearly the most painful thing they had seen in a long time. Poliquin, who\u2019d used ART on his athletes under Mike Leahy for four years, had to use two hands: \u201cYou know it\u2019s bad when I have to use two hands. I never have to use two hands.\u201d He had two 200-plus-pound assistants guiding my arms through movements as he applied enough pressure to put his fingers a good inch in between muscles that had either fused to bone or fused to adjacent antagonistic muscles. I felt like a Thanksgiving turkey. The before-and-after photos below tell a more complete story. Before treatment\u2014the range of motion of a pi\u00f1ata. Notice Charles laughing. Page 381 During the treatment. After treatment. Charles estimated he\u2019d need three or four more sessions to fix the restriction in both shoulders completely. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d helped resurrect shoulders: \u201cA few years ago, my good friend and IFBB professional bodybuilder Milos Sarcev called me out of the blue. He mentioned that he was scheduled to have arthroscopic surgery the following week for both of his shoulders. He was understandably upset. For one thing, the surgery would cost him about $18,000. Additionally, he\u2019d have to undergo an extensive rehab program, and this would keep him from competing and earning an income for a long time. I told him to get his ass over to my office right away and see [Dr. Mike Leahy] before letting a surgeon anywhere near his shoulders. \u201cWhen Milos came to the office, he hadn\u2019t trained in over four months because of the excruciating pain. Even lowering an unloaded Olympic bar (45 Page 382 pounds) caused him to recoil in pain. However, after working on him [on adhesions around his subscapularis muscle] for just 45 minutes, Dr. Leahy told Milos to go to the gym and give his shoulders a trial run. Somewhat reluctantly, Milos allowed me to take him to the local World Gym. In total disbelief, he bench-pressed 315 pounds for two reps. Five days later, he did 6 reps with 315 pounds without feeling any pain!\u201d ART sessions are typically 5\u201315 minutes in length and cost $45\u2013100 each. Most client injuries are treated in one to six sessions. Soft-tissue injuries eligible for ART treatment include rotator cuff impingement, tendinitis, low-back strain, ankle and wrist sprain, shin splints, hip flexor impingement, and carpal tunnel syndrome. But ART isn\u2019t perfect. As Charles noted: \u201cART is 100% effective in 70% of patients.\u201d Fixing chronic pain often requires a combination of therapies. Sometimes that involves needles, which brings us to the next stage: medication. 5. PROLOTHERAPY. AREAS FIXED: LEFT KNEE, RIGHT WRIST. In prolotherapy (so named for the \u201cproliferation\u201d of collagen fibers it\u2019s supposed to produce), a mixture of irritants are injected into tendons, ligaments, and inside joints themselves. The objective is to create a mild inflammatory response that stimulates tissue repair. The simplest of prolotherapy cocktails, and the one with the longest track record, was"

    "text": "developed by the founder of the technique, George Hackett MD. His mixture is, in effect, \u201csugar water\u201d: dextrose mixed with a local anesthetic (lidocaine) and saline (saltwater). Dr. C. Everett Koop, the 13th surgeon general of the United States, opened the doors for wider research on prolotherapy when he publicly endorsed it: Prolotherapy, unless you have tried it and proven its worth, seems to be too easy a solution to a series of complicated problems that afflict the human body and have been notoriously difficult to treat by any other method.\u2026 When I was 40 years old, I was diagnosed in two separate neurological clinics as having intractable (incurable) pain. My comment was that I was too young to have intractable pain. It was by chance that I learned that Gustav A. Hemwall, M.D., a practitioner in the suburbs of Chicago, was an expert in prolotherapy.\u2026 To make a long story short, my intractable pain was not intractable and I was remarkably improved to the point where my Page 383 pain ceased to be a problem. The nice thing about prolotherapy, if properly done, is that it cannot do any harm. How could placing a little sugar-water at the junction of a ligament with a bone be harmful to a patient? In 2005, doctors at the Mayo Clinic began testing prolotherapy and identified the most responsive injury sites as the knees, elbows, ankles, and the sacroiliac joint in the low back. They concluded in their newsletter that \u201cunlike corticosteroid injections\u2014which may provide temporary relief\u2014prolotherapy involves improving the injected tissue by stimulating tissue growth.\u201d The prolo cocktail I used at the clinic mentioned at the opening of this chapter had a few additional ingredients: Dextrose Marcaine (anesthetic) B-12 Proline Lysine Glucosamine sulfate My first session entailed 12 prolo injections. It wasn\u2019t all fun and games. For 45 minutes after the first session, I had vertigo and a cold, numb right hand. On the positive side, decade-old pain in my right wrist (from impact in gymnastics) and my left knee (wrestling) both disappeared approximately 21 days after the last session. The dangers of the ingredients are minimal, particularly when a simple dextrose-based version is used, but there is always the risk, albeit small, of infection. If a needle passes through the skin, it can carry bacteria from the skin into the target site. This is most serious when the infection occurs inside a joint and turns it septic, a process that can cause the joint cartilage to deteriorate in as little as 72 hours. A survey in France reported an overall risk of sepsis of 13 per 1 million injections, with a much lower incidence if prepackaged syringes are used. That said, after one staph infection, I was eager to explore less invasive injections, which led to the next therapy: biopuncture. 6. BIOPUNCTURE. AREAS FIXED: INFRASPINATUS, ACHILLES TENDON. Page 384 \u201cCan you hear that?\u201d I could, and it was disgusting. Dr. Lee Wolfer was in the process of giving me between 40 and 60 injections 1 with small needles commonly used for tuberculosis tests. Each injection was no more than half an inch under the skin, but the noise emanating from my infraspinatus, one of the rotator cuff muscles in the shoulders, sounded like someone walking on hard snow: audible crunching. \u201cThat\u2019s calcium deposited where it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Lee, one of the foremost spine and back specialists in the United States, then got back to work. The injections weren\u2019t close to done. I\u2019d given her a laundry list\u2014neck, upper back, shoulders, ankles\u2014and we had a lot of ground to cover. Lee is now a die-hard fascist. \u201cFascist,\u201d that is, in the sense of someone who treats the long-neglected fascia as more than just anatomical glue. The results have, so far, been impressive: \u201cI\u2019m finally happy as a doctor. I\u2019m helping my patients\u2019 bodies to heal themselves.\u201d The \u201cfascia\u201d comprise a three-dimensional web of fibrous connective tissue that maintains the structure of the body.

    "text": "ropes that hold the tent in its shape. Ropes that help to bind muscles together and keep internal organs suspended, among other things. Ever heard runners complain of plantar fasciitis? It\u2019s a fascial problem, and a painful one. The plantar fascia of the foot is a thick band of connective tissue that extends from the heel to the five toes. It supports the arch of the foot, and when it becomes inflamed and compromises that arch, chronic pain is the result. It\u2019s not just a foot issue. The fascia exist throughout the body and also have biochemical roles. Lee\u2019s journey started with a research paper on lower-back pain, where she noticed the researchers had observed something odd: the patients\u2019 fascia looked like those of diabetics. There were unusual calcium deposits throughout the tissue, which she later saw in her own patients. The area of greatest concern was the Grand Central Station of the entire back: the thoraco-dorsal fascia. This fascial sheath connects prime movers like the lats and the glutes in the lumbar area, and problems in Grand Central can cause pain almost anywhere. Fascia are masterful at misdirection. Fascial slings can connect areas like the right shoulder to the left lower back, and pinpointing the actual problem requires a Sherlock Holmes\u2013like ability to connect seemingly unconnected dots, often outside of the body. Page 385 Just one example from diet: Lee had come to realize the importance of eating nutrient-dense animal foods with adequate fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) to restore function in chronically inflamed tissues with abnormal calcium deposits. Now, Lee was using me to test her latest and greatest: biopuncture. Coined in 1991 by Jan Kersschot MD, a Belgian physician, \u201cbiopuncture\u201d involves shallow injections of different substances, including Traumeel, zdeel, and lymphomyosot. Traumeel is typically used for acute inflammation from sports injuries, and lymphomyosot is utilized for lymphatic drainage in chronically swollen or congested tissue. Traumeel has been shown in some peer- reviewed journals to shorten recovery time from acute sports injuries and inhibit the secretion of immune mediators (IL-1B and TNF-alpha) that are associated Page 386 with tissue damage and increased inflammation. Though biopuncture solutions aren\u2019t diluted to the extent that they contain no active product (like most homeopathic medicine), they are diluted and referred to as \u201cmicrodoses.\u201d Lee used both Traumeel and lymphomyosot in my treatments. In addition to the drug treatments, we also tested a saline solution with 20% dextrose. It was just like prolotherapy but with shallower injections. The results of dozens of \u201cbaby jabs\u201d with a small 30-gauge half-inch needle were amazing. Twelve hours after the first treatment of both infraspinatus muscles, I had zero pain at the rear of either shoulder. I had suffered through persistent pain and soreness at the back of both shoulders for more than six years, and one 15- minute session fixed both of them. To date, no pain has returned. The biopuncture was repeated for the right Achilles tendon, with similar results. I think the mechanisms of action, while unclear, could be different for different locations. In the case of the infraspinatus, it seemed to be mechanical: the breakdown of calcium deposits with a needle, much like hacking at ice on your windshield. For the Achilles tendon, Lee hypothesized that it was some form of cutano-muscular or cutano-neural response. Given their homeopathic origins, I remain skeptical of lymphomyosot and, to a lesser extent, Traumeel. But, given the minimal downside of biopuncture and the results I\u2019ve experienced, I would recommend testing biopuncture before prolotherapy or PRP. For most musculoskeletal problems, a series of four to eight injection sessions are recommended. TOOLS AND TRICKS This chapter will encourage a slew of con artists to become self-proclaimed experts.

To skip the crowds at the beaches, we chartered a boat with a captain to the best secluded surf spots up the coast. En route home, the captain also helped us catch and clean fish our private chef could prepare for dinner. Now, it was 12 hours before my return flight to San Francisco, and I was going to pay for the whole thing with one trip to the hospital. An Introduction to Medical Tourism Let\u2019s look at the math to see how this is possible. First, the per-person expenses in Nicaragua: EXPENSES Round-trip Orbitz airfare to Nicaragua from San Francisco (one stop in Houston)\u2014$385 + taxes Page 391 Chartered boat (per trip per person)\u2014$20 First week housing ($2,000 per week for nine people in a 14-bed villa owned by a former NBA player)\u2014$222 per week Second week housing onward (gorgeous two-bed villa closer to downtown [ www.palermohotelandresort.com ])\u2014$129 per night Land Rover rental (per person)\u2014$140 per week Total for two and a half weeks, excluding food\u2014$1,812 I\u2019ve excluded food above to show costs above what I would have spent in the U.S. anyway, as I eat out at least two times a day in San Francisco. Here is the grand total: Total for two and a half weeks, including food and wine (+$600): $2,412 So how do we get back to break-even and make the trip, in effect, free? MEDICAL SAVINGS I had seven MRIs taken at a negotiated price of $400 each. For comparison purposes, similar MRIs in San Francisco would have cost approximately $750 each, so 7 \u00d7 $350 savings = $2,450 total cost savings. I also saved roughly $640 on comprehensive blood and urine testing by having it done in Nicaragua rather than the United States. Thus, my total savings on medical expenses came to $3,090. I enjoyed a surf trip in luxury, got a ton of writing done, and then took care of testing and imaging that I wanted to do anyhow. The total cost savings of $3,090 put me ahead (in essence, gave me a profit on the trip) of $687. \u201cBut,\u201d you might rightly point out, \u201cwhat if I\u2019m not a freak who wants seven MRIs?\u201d First, despite urban myths to the contrary, there is no radiation risk with MRIs, and I would therefore suggest one or two of them for nagging pains or injuries. Not to mention the preventative value: ask any cancer survivor if they wish they\u2019d had MRIs earlier. But MRIs aside, the beauty of this geographic arbitrage is the menu of options. I never seriously considered medical tourism before 2009, as I didn\u2019t have pending surgeries I couldn\u2019t afford, nor did I want cosmetic procedures (butt implants, anyone?), which medical tourism agencies have made popular. Page 392 Testing and prevention, though, opened up a world of combining world-class travel with world-class medicine. Due for a dental cleaning and checkup? Perhaps you want to run comprehensive blood work, which I recommend no less than every six months? Consider making a kick-ass trip out of it. That same exotic dream trip, something you might otherwise postpone forever because of expense, could end up as good as free. Perhaps the lure of travel is exactly the incentive you need to take a closer look at your health? To get a full appreciation of how easy it was, and how much my experience contrasted with most U.S. hospitals, let me recount the process. As Easy as 1, 2, 3 I showed up at the private hospital"

The Kiwi had swimmer\u2019s ear and needed to get it drained prior to his flight, and I wanted to cover the costs of the trip at the same time. The easiest option: take MRIs of all joints with residual pain from sports injuries. I asked The Kiwi\u2019s doctor if I could have MRIs taken, and she informed me that I needed to speak with a supervisor, whom she called in. The list price was $600 per MRI. I asked for her best volume discount for five MRIs: she responded with $2,400. I told her I would pay in cash (credit card) instead of insurance if she could do $2,800 for seven MRIs, or $400 per MRI. She agreed. The entire transaction was cordial and pleasant. The supervisor authorized the MRIs in five minutes and had a car service sent to pick up technician Edwin, who was at home, and bring him to the hospital. I would not be charged for the pickup. The doctors, realizing we had some time to wait, invited me to sit down with them and share their favorite indigenous fruit, called jocote (Red Mombin), which I\u2019d never tasted. I then asked them what else I could do to fill the remaining 60 minutes of time. Urinalysis? Blood tests? Two doctors pulled out a list of tests I could order and we went through them together, ticking off 25 boxes I wanted, as well as a few the doctors suggested as often-neglected but important. They priced out each item for me, I had blood drawn 10 minutes later, and they promised results from the lab within three hours. Three hours?! This amazed me, as I usually wait Page 393 seven to ten days for blood test results in the United States. Then I remembered: I was in the ER. It was a far cry from the UCSF Parnassus equivalent, where I\u2019d once been chastised by a doctor because I looked at my own chart after waiting for more than three hours in an empty room: \u201cThat\u2019s property of UCSF. Patients aren\u2019t allowed to look at charts. Give it to me.\u201d This spotless and friendly environment in Nicaragua felt so much like a private club that I\u2019d forgotten I was in an ER. I was the only person there. Edwin came in, we completed the MRIs, and, at his insistence, we then took several X-rays for reference images, which I was not charged for. He handed me all of the images and showed me back to the front desk, where I had my blood test, urinalysis reports, and a glass of water waiting for me. The supervisor explained that there were few cabs at this late hour\u2014around 3:00 A.M .\u2014so she ordered a car service, at the hospital\u2019s expense, to take me back to my hotel. She gave me a hug and wished me safe travels. Back in the U.S., when I began to reverse more injuries with the help of MDs (the last chapter), the MRIs from Nicaragua were invaluable. Each saved me expensive imaging orders, as well as guesswork that would have led to weeks of inappropriate therapies. Sadly, the 11-minute visit average per patient in the United States produces a lot of mistakes, but most MDs will not order just-in- case images to prevent them. Why? Because, as a clinic or doctor, ordering a lot of images increases the likelihood of being audited by insurance companies. In my case, if a hasty diagnosis was made in 11 minutes, I was now able to pull MRIs out of my bag and say, \u201cLet\u2019s make sure, shall we?\u201d This, I believe, is a very prudent thing to do.

Page 395 PRE-HAB Injury-Proofing the Body I never struggled with injury problems, because of my preparation. In particular, my stretching. \u2014Edwin Moses, two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 400-meter hurdles; winner of 122 consecutive races Preface: This is the longest and most difficult chapter in the book, and for a high percentage of readers, it will be the most important. Pursuing rapid increases in performance without doing \u201cpre-hab\u201d for injury prevention is like getting in an F-1 racecar without checking the tires. The small upfront investment of time (even two to four weeks) will allow much faster progress while avoiding serious setbacks. Skim it now or return to it later, but don\u2019t forget to read this chapter if you\u2019re incorporating strength or speed training. 1:30 P.M., CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA T he security guard at Virgin Active Health Club was not impressed. In a country with 25% official unemployment, violence was less common than you\u2019d expect, but it still paid to be vigilant. I explained my idea again, which involved taking a thick three-foot metal pipe into the gym. The plan was to saw off the base of an umbrella stand and drill a half-inch hole in one end. \u201cNo, really. It\u2019s for my workout. Not for hitting receptionists.\u201d The last part didn\u2019t seem to help my argument. \u201cBut, but, Gray Cook told me to do it!\u201d I wanted to pout. \u201cDon\u2019t you know Gray Cook?!\u201d He wouldn\u2019t know him. The real shame is, most people don\u2019t, even if he could make their bodies indestructible. Gray\u2019s Anatomy: From the NFL to Special Ops Page 396 Michelle Wie was, for several months, arguably the most famous injured athlete on the planet. During a brief time in 2008, her injuries prevented her from doing a single push-up or holding steady on one foot for 10 seconds. Not exactly what you would expect from the youngest woman ever to qualify for an LPGA golf tour event. Sponsored by Nike and heralded as \u201cone of 100 people who shape our world\u201d by Time magazine, it seemed that she had been forced past her prime. She wasn\u2019t even 20 years old. \u201cBefore [training], Michelle could drive 320 yards with the wind at her back. Now, one year later, she can still drive the same 320 yards. The difference is that she can now do it 300 times a day.\u201d Gray Cook, the mastermind behind Michelle\u2019s rapid recovery, was schooling me from his quiet base in Danville, Virginia. He saw what the general public missed. Even injured, Michelle could crush the ball. Most assumed that, if power was there, all was well. But she was inconsistent. Power was just one piece of the puzzle. Fixing professional athletes in his human durability factory, Gray has become perhaps the world\u2019s most sought-after injury-prevention specialist. In 2007, both the Chicago Bears and the Indiana Colts used him as their secret weapon to keep athletes on the field, and both teams ended up at Super Bowl XLI. Gray wasn\u2019t limited to the ranks of the NFL, MLB, NHL, or NBA. The special forces also placed their bet on this soft-spoken"

    "text": "southerner. Gray explains: \u201cThe Pentagon puts as many millions into someone on the Special Ops as an NFL team puts into a player, but an NFL career might last three years, whereas a Delta Force career should be more than ten.\u201d Millions. That\u2019s a lot of money. How on earth do you injury-proof yourself if you don\u2019t have access to someone like Gray? Revisit beating my favorite dead horse, of course: the 80/20 principle. 80/20 Functional Screening According to Gray the most likely cause of injury is neither weakness nor tightness, but imbalance. Think doing crunches or isolated ab work is enough to work your core muscles? Think again. \u201cThe core, as just one example, often works fine as long as one\u2019s hips aren\u2019t moving. It\u2019s when the hips are moving\u2014a Page 397 more realistic scenario\u2014that the core starts to compensate for left-right differences.\u201d That\u2019s when you get injured. Gray\u2019s fundamental tool for identifying imbalances is his brainchild: the Functional Movement Screen (FMS). The FMS is a series of seven movement tests administered by a certified professional. Each test is scored on a three-point scale. For self-assessment, his professional FMS can be abbreviated to five movements with simple pass-fail evaluation: 1. Deep squat 2. Hurdle step 3. In-line lunge 4. Active straight leg raise 5. Seated rotation This self-FMS is designed to identify two things: left-right imbalances (asymmetry) and motor control issues (wobbling and shifting). Even if you can bench-press 600 pounds, it doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t dislocate a shoulder five minutes into a game. More weight with more reps does not equal stability. \u201cMost people can press more weight overhead for a set than they can walk with overhead for the same period of time. Strength [the former] should never exceed stability [the latter],\u201d Gray Cook explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for disaster. The biggest misconception is that you can strengthen stabilizers [like the rotator cuff for the shoulder] alone to prevent injury. Even 10% stronger is like pissing in the ocean.\u201d Working muscles in isolation will change muscles, but it\u2019s not likely to make movement safer. In contrast, working on basic movement patterns will make muscles stronger and it will also make movement (whether running a 40-yard dash or carrying luggage) safer. To use an analogy of Paul Chek\u2019s, the basic movement patterns are like the 0\u20139 keys on a calculator. All other numbers, complex movements in this case, are still combinations of the basics. Does the FMS work? The Atlanta Falcons professional football team suffered seven season-ending injuries in 2007. In the 2008 season, there was just one minor surgery late in the Page 398 season. The difference: their new director of athletic performance, Jeff Fish, made the FMS mandatory. Once players are \u201cdiagnosed\u201d with the FMS, they receive personalized programs to correct imbalances and improve range of motion. Then there\u2019s the Colts. The Indianapolis Colts have been the smallest NFL team in the nation for the last nine years. They\u2019ve also had the fewest injuries of any NFL team and the highest total of games won in the last nine years. This is an unusual combination. Jon Torine, their head strength coach, has used the FMS for that entire period of time. The Critical Four Initially, this chapter was going to be dedicated to the FMS. That was, until I realized that isolating the problems with the FMS was just the first step. Step two was prescribing the corrective actions for each major mistake in each of the five movements, and that would easily take 50 pages of dense material. So I e-mailed Gray to reduce the seemingly irreducible: Assuming people do the screen, what are the 2\u20134 corrective exercises that you\u2019d suggest to best fix the most common imbalances/weaknesses? If you had a gun to your head and had to pick 2\u20134 exercises for correction across the board, what would you choose? Gray\u2019s picks were, without hesitation, the following critical four: Chop and lift (C&L) Turkish"

    "text": "get-up (TGU) Two-arm single-leg deadlift (2SDL) Cross-body one-arm single-leg deadlift (1SDL) I\u2019ve put the exercises in the order that you should learn them, as greater coordination is required as you move down the list. There is no shame in sticking with just the C&L for two to four weeks if the other three prove awkward to incorporate at the beginning. I\u2019ll first summarize the exact schedule I used to find and fix my imbalances in \u201cThe Critical Four Schedule\u201d below. This provides the big picture before we dive into details, and it should serve as an easy-to-find reference later. Then I\u2019ll Page 399 describe the exercises, using primarily Gray\u2019s words. The exercises are not complicated, but using text instead of video can make it seem so. Use the videos listed in \u201cTools and Tricks\u201d to become familiar with the Critical Four, and return to the below summary if overwhelmed. The Critical Four Schedule: Finding and Fixing Here is a potential schedule for putting it all together. WEEK 1: TUESDAY, 30\u201345 MINUTES COORDINATION This is not a workout. This session is about practicing the movements, just like a dance or karate form. For this purpose, light weights are used, even for movements that use heavier loading in training (like the deadlift). Developing a base level of coordination with these patterns will ensure that you do not base an entire training program on massive imbalances that could have been fixed with a few minutes of practice and neural adaptation. Practice both the TGU and variations of the SDL with no weight until you can perform the movement on both sides, then add light weight. In all exercises, use the minimal weight needed to help stabilize the body. WEEK 1: THURSDAY AND SATURDAY, 45\u201360 MINUTES PER SESSION TESTING Now we will test to find your weakest quadrant and weakest sides in each movement. Perform the TGU and SDL only if you can execute them flawlessly without weight: C&L (like my example on this page ) Chop down to left knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps Chop down to right knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps Lift up to left knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps Lift up to right knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps TGU 5 TGU each side (16-kg kettlebell) 5 TGU each side (24-kg kettlebell) Page 400 These TGU weights are what I used. Read the TGU description that follows for suggested male and female starting weights. Dumbbells can be used in place of kettlebells. 2SDL 5 reps each leg 1SDL 5 reps each leg FULL-RANGE SQUAT 10 reps I\u2019ve added the full-range squat because it\u2019s important to at least maintain (or have) the ability to perform this movement, even if our focus is on the deadlift. Repeat this testing both Thursday and Saturday to ensure that you haven\u2019t misdiagnosed imbalances. Use the same weights on Saturday, but don\u2019t look at the number of reps completed on Thursday. Saturday is, once again, to confirm that imbalances aren\u2019t just mistakes of some sort. WEEKS 2\u20136: MONDAY AND FRIDAY, 30\u201345 MINUTES PER SESSION FIXING Once you\u2019ve identified your imbalances, the exercises for weeks 2\u20136 are designed to fix them. If you can perform 10 ass-to-heels squats with no weight, do the following in each workout (sets and reps are explained next): 1. Half-kneeling C&L 2. TGU 3. 1SDL If you cannot perform 10 full-range squats, perform this instead: 1. Half-kneeling C&L 2. Full-kneeling C&L (this is a symmetrical addition, both knees down, that will help you develop proper squatting form) Page 401 3. TGU 4. 1SDL SETS AND REPS: For all exercises for weeks 2\u20136, use a 2:5 ratio of sets for strong:weak sides and a repetition range of 3\u20135 . This means that you perform a total of seven sets, two for the stronger side and five for the weaker side, as follows: Strong side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps (I aim for 5 on all) Weak side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps Strong side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps Weak side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps Weak side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps Weak side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps Weak side \u00d7 3\u20135 reps Take one minute between sets. If you can\u2019t complete five repetitions in the later sets, decrease the repetitions rather than decreasing the weight. Record everything. I suggest"

OPTIONAL WEEKS 7+: MONDAY AND FRIDAY, 30\u201345 MINUTES PER SESSION\u2014SUSTAINED PRE-HAB AND STRENGTHENING For weeks 7 and beyond, you can incorporate the full- kneeling C&L and 2SDL for symmetrical corrections and pure strength. Perform this sequence twice a week if you\u2019d like to further reduce injury risk. I simply retest every 4\u20136 weeks and fix accordingly. But to continue with the program, once 10% or greater strength differences are corrected, use two sets of 3\u20135 reps (I prefer 5) per side for each exercise. TGU Full-kneeling C&L 2SDL Half-kneeling C&L 1SDL Page 402 The 2SDL is performed exactly like the 1SDL but instead of lifting with one arm, you either hold a barbell with both hands, or, my preference, hold a dumbbell/kettlebell in each hand. Taking 30\u201345 minutes twice per week to do these exercises takes less time, and sacrifices less progress, than 6\u201324 months of recovery after a major injury. Four exercises can keep you stable and strong. Too busy? Do whatever you can, as every bit helps. Focus on pre-hab so you never have to do rehab. Exercise Details EXERCISE #1\u2014CHOP AND LIFT (C&L) Chopping is a downward diagonal movement across the body from a high position to a low position, and lifting is the upward diagonal movement from a low position to a high position. They are essentially mirror images of one another. The start and finish positions of the chop. Page 403 The start and finish positions of the lift. The block under the knee, which I did not use, is optional and used here to achieve a more acute upward angle. There are two stances commonly used when performing the C&L, seen above. We will focus on the \u201chalf- kneeling\u201d C&L for two reasons. First, it is important to address asymmetrical (left-right) problems before any issues present on both sides, and the half-kneeling position addresses both upper and lower asymmetries. Second, of the six people I tested with a single-leg flexibility assessment (see sidebar), all had major left- right differences. Half-Kneeling Description One knee is down and one knee is up, with thighs and calves at 90-degree right angles to each other. The full and half-kneeling leg positions. You will always chop to the down knee and lift toward the upward knee. Each move is a pull- to- a- push movement, and keep the hands close to the chest on the transition. In the chop, for example, you pull the bar to your sternum and press it to the floor. The cable should travel in a straight line. Both the front foot and down knee should ideally be placed in a straight line, Page 404 and tape on the ground (or any line) can be used to ensure this is the case. Ideal placement on one line. If this narrow stance proves too difficult, use a wider base. Put your front foot four inches off the knee line and bring it in closer over several workouts. Just ensure that the width is the same for the left and right sides in each individual workout, which is critical for keeping your comparisons accurate. The 80/20 Chopping and Lifting Program Guidelines 1. Stick with a \u201cbar\u201d for the first month or two. Both the half-kneeling chop and the half-kneeling lift will be performed on cables using either an attachable bar or, as in our photographs, the more common \u201ctricep extension\u201d attachment with the rope fully slid to one side to imitate a bar. This is what I used. On the left: Tricep rope attachment (normal). On the right: Rope attachment converted into a \u201cbar.\u201d This bar or fake-bar approach forces you to use your core to counteract the mechanical disadvantage, rather than cheat through the movement with arm strength. Page 405 If you want to perform the C&L at home or while traveling, you can use resistance bands. 2 If using bands, the movement becomes more of a press to the front of the body as opposed to across the body. 2. Unload between repetitions if possible (rest"

    "text": "the weight stack). This is something I missed in my first several workouts, as I was overseas and incommunicado. I still doubled my strength and corrected my imbalance within four workouts without unloading, but I made faster progress later with it. If you find it overwhelming to coordinate, you can start without it. Try it yourself: 1 . Keeping your feet together and knees locked, attempt to touch your toes with both feet on the ground. If that\u2019s too easy, attempt to touch the heel of your palms to your toes. 2 . Now test the same stretch again on each side independently. Place one foot on a step or block, and remember to keep your knees fully locked to prevent cheating. Perform on both sides. On the left: Step 1. One the right: Step 2. Page 406 How did you fare? My reach was a full three inches shorter on my right side. Gray explains the concept: \u201cImbalance is not just a strength problem. It is a motor control problem. Going from unloaded to loaded and vice versa is the whole point. Reengaging is where the money is, and where you stimulate more neurons.\u201d But how do you get in the proper position, which requires having the rope in hand at a distance from the machine, without automatically lifting the weight stack? In other words, how do you rest the weight without falling over? You need to extend the cable. The best option involves carabiners, the metal clips used in rock climbing. First option: use a link of chain from a hardware store and two carabiners to extend the cable. One end of the chain will connect to the cable, and the other end will connect to the tricep attachment. This works. The second option, and the one I prefer, is to use a nylon sling (or \u201cpocket daisy chain\u201d) designed for rock climbing in place of the chain. The nylon sling is a flat strip of material with loops on it. This webbing is light enough to fold up and put in your pocket, but it\u2019s plenty strong enough to hold the weights in the chop-and-lift movements. I travel with this. If you don\u2019t want to bother with extending the length of the cable, you can train with a partner who takes the weight from you for a second after each repetition, or simply train without unloading, as I did for four workouts, which was enough to correct my largest imbalance. 3. Don\u2019t hold your breath. Once I progressed to heavier weights, I ended up holding my breath on the lifting portion and then exhaling slowly on the lowering. This is referred to as the Valsalva Technique, and though it can be valuable for maximal lifts, it is cheating in the C&L. Do your best to breathe as follows and keep your face relaxed: a. Inhale a large amount of air at the start of the movement and pressurize your abdomen by tightening all the muscles in your hips and torso. Stiffen and brace your body but stay as tall as possible. b. Begin the pulling portion of either movement and force air out between your clenched teeth to produce a hissing sound. Continue this slow continuous hiss as Page 407 you transition into the pushing and reach full extension. Upon full extension, you should still have more than 50% of the air in your lungs. Continue the hiss on the return, using the remaining air, until the weight stack comes to rest. c. Take two normal breaths, the weight stack resting, and start the next repetition. 4. Make your positioning 100% consistent workout to workout. Foot placement: To standardize position from one workout to the next, Gray suggests using a stretching or yoga mat, narrow end against the machine, and then setting your down knee approximately one-third of the way from the far end of the mat. If you own the mat (yoga mats can be rolled up and are a smart investment), use something like a Sharpie to mark knee placement for both movements. If you don\u2019t own the mat, use tape. Here\u2019s a diagram showing Gray\u2019s ideal placement and what I ended up doing: I started using a standard stretching mat to prevent mat burn on my knees, not for placement. Then I realized, no big surprise, that"

    "text": "using a mat made replicating the exact positions much easier. I placed my down knee at the midpoint halfway from the weight stack, as I didn\u2019t have tape and halfway was easier to visually determine. I then ensured that my hips were approximately in front of the center of the weight stack. While not precisely what Gray recommended, it made the positioning for both sides and movements easy to remember. For foot and down knee alignment, as seen in the diagram, I put my knee Page 408 down on one side of the imaginary half-way line, and my foot on the other. The hips don\u2019t need to face exactly at a 90-degree angle from the weight stack, but I found this easiest to remember and replicate. Hand positioning: For hand positioning in both the chop and the lift, I placed the hand farthest from the machine exactly three hand-widths up from the dangling end of the rope \u201cbar.\u201d My hand nearest the machine grabbed the rope as close as possible to the cable. Head and shoulder rotation: The head should not rotate independently of the shoulders. If we imagine the hips and shoulders square with each other in the starting position, you shouldn\u2019t rotate the shoulders more than 15\u201320 degrees off the hips. More rotation will not get more activation out of the abs, and it could force you to lose the proper lower back and \u201ctall spine\u201d position. Let the Testing Begin Finding imbalances in the C&L is done by testing the four quadrants: lower left, lower right, then upper left, upper right. The goal is to identify your single weakest quadrant. The chop is always done before the lift, as you will use heavier weights for the former. TESTING Chop down to left knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps Chop down to right knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps Lift up to left knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps (be sure to move slowly for the lowering portion of the lift, or the weight will pull you over) Lift up to right knee \u00d7 6\u201312 reps The test is best done at the beginning of a workout. For the lift portions, subtract half or even two-thirds of the weight used for the chop. Choose a weight for both movements that you believe you can perform for no more than 6\u201312 repetitions, and then look for discrepancies in quality and your ability to hit maximum repetitions on either side. It should be a mild struggle. You want to do a complete \u201crep-out\u201d within 6\u201312 repetitions, so that you test to the point of loss of appropriate posture and/or smooth movement, or to the point where a struggle is demonstrated that compromises technique. Page 409 Thus, you\u2019re lifting to \u201cfailure\u201d of posture or technique, not muscular failure. Keep the back straight, the hips neutral, and your head as tall as possible. \u201cLoss of posture\u201d occurs when you cannot maintain this tall position and your head drops or moves to the side. Stop your repetition count when you can no longer correct this. Though not required, it is helpful to have someone watch you or record the test on video. 3 For both sides, count the maximum number of repetitions until the movement is no longer smooth and fluid. If you happen to miscalculate the weight and exceed 12 repetitions, keep going and record the repetition when posture fails. Just use the same weight on both sides. Once the test is complete, you should have an assessment of four quadrants\u2014 the right and left chop and the right and left lift. Imbalances are defined as a greater than 10% difference in weight (if the same number of reps) or number of repetitions (if the same weight) between left and right sides. Find the weakest quadrant and work there until symmetry is restored. Here are the results from my first day of testing: Chop down to left knee: 20 lbs \u00d7 7.5 reps Chop down to right knee: 20 lbs \u00d7 15 reps(!), and I could have done 3\u20134 more Lift up to left knee: 10 lbs \u00d7 13 reps Lift up to right knee: 10 lbs \u00d7 14 reps I tested again two days later, as I wanted to confirm my imbalance before planing an entire program. I did confirm it, but you can already see an incredible motor control improvement, which is reflected"

The worst imbalance had been corrected, and the back soreness I experienced from extended writing had all but disappeared along with it. You will be amazed at how many other core issues clean themselves up by simply finding the weakest quadrant and addressing it. EXERCISE #2\u2014TURKISH GET-UP (TGU) If Gray could pick just one movement from our Critical Four, he would pick the Turkish get-up. The TGU can be a complex move, and it should be viewed as a long-term investment. If it gets frustrating, view it as a low-weight warm-up that you practice for a few minutes before each workout, and just focus on increasing resistance with the other movements until you\u2019re 100% comfortable. This is the movement that Gray used most with Michelle Wie, along with the basic swing. 4 The TGU is an elegant solution that includes nine discrete movements which, in combination, address all of the major muscle groups and planes of movement. Gray underscores why the mainstream usually doesn\u2019t see it: \u201cThe Turkish get-up and swing just aren\u2019t sexy enough for the glossy magazines. Am I actually saying that you can be a world-class athlete and only do TGU and swings for injury prevention? Yes, pretty much.\u201d 5 Once Michelle was able to do a full TGU with a 16-kilogram (35.2-pound) kettlebell, supervised by TGU phenom Dr. Mark Cheng, the gains she\u2019d made with rehab, chopping and lifting, and the single-leg deadlifts were integrated and Page 411 locked in place. The TGU can be thought of as your \u201cSave Document\u201d function. In other words, the C&L moves the upper body while freezing the lower body; the SDL (coming next) moves the lower body while freezing the upper body; and once both halves have been strengthened, the TGU is what pieces them together. If you don\u2019t \u201cSave Document\u201d at the end of a workout with the TGU, the lower-body and upper-body gains aren\u2019t incorporated for full-body movement. The TGU is also stunningly effective as a stand-alone exercise. Jon Torine, head strength coach of the Indianapolis Colts, states in no uncertain terms: \u201cMy job is exercise, injury prevention, and performance enhancement. I start with the TGU. I finish with the TGU. I check progress with the TGU.\u201d The amount of weight you should use depends on your TGU experience, not your strength in other exercises. For dumbbells or kettlebells: FEMALE Beginner: 4\u20136 kg (8.8\u201313.2 lbs) Intermediate: 6\u20138 kg (13.2\u201317.6 lbs) Advanced: 8\u201312 kg (17.6\u201326.4 lbs) or larger MALE Beginner: 8\u201312 kg (17.6\u201326.4 lbs) Intermediate: 12\u201316 kg (26.4\u201335.2 lbs) Advanced: 16\u201324 kg (35.2\u201352.8 lbs) or larger Though there are many versions of the TGU, on this page is one designed as a systemic corrective exercise. It provides the most detailed feedback. Some other forms\u2014those that omit certain pauses, for example\u2014allow for more compensation and make it easier to miss weak links. Demonstrated by Brett Jones from the left side on the following page, steps 1\u2013 9 are illustrated in the photo sequence, which would then be reversed in exact order to return the kettlebell to the ground. The photos can be used for reference and for spot-checking, but please view a video of proper execution before attempting ( www.fourhourbody.com/tgu ). If the complete TGU is too difficult, you can stop at the arm post (step 5) and identify the left-right discrepancies up to this point. This \u201chalf-TGU\u201d is Page 412 outstanding for shoulder rehabilitation, and is now prescribed in some high-end physical therapy clinics specifically for this purpose. EXERCISE #3, #4\u2014THE CROSS-BODY ONE-ARM SINGLE-LEG DEADLIFT (1SDL)"

    "text": "The standard deadlift is simple: grab a barbell just outside of the knees with both hands and stand to a fully erect position. The single-leg deadlift, as the name implies, is this movement performed on a single leg. The deep muscles of the hip are designed to be stabilizers as much as movers, and the single-leg deadlift allows them to function in this role, making left-right imbalances obvious at the same time. The variation we\u2019ll focus on\u2014the cross- Page 413 body one-arm single-leg deadlift (1SDL) \u2014involves a single dumbbell or kettlebell instead of a barbell. Before using just one arm, though, you need to become comfortable on one leg. Learning with the Two-Arm Single-Leg Deadlift (2SDL) Start and finish of the 2SDL. Note that the toes of the rear foot must be pointing at the ground, not outward. Though we\u2019ll use the 1SDL in training, it\u2019s a good idea to first become comfortable with the single-leg deadlift using two arms. Two loaded arms create balance, and this allows you to focus on the most important element of the deadlift: the hip. Learning with two arms takes less than 15 minutes. Here\u2019s how: Using a set of light dumbbells (10\u201330 pounds each), do 3\u20135 sets of 3\u20135 reps of Page 414 the 2SDL to become comfortable with core stabilization and balance on one foot. The guidelines are identical to those for the 1SDL below but involve two hands and two dumbbells. It will feel unusual. Prepare for your arches to be sore afterward. This brief time with the 2SDL will help prevent undue frustration when you move to the 1SDL, which involves many more forces, such as counter-rotation and counter- sidebending. Use the below guidelines for practicing the 2SDL first, with two hands and two weights. Performing the One-Arm Single-Leg Deadlift \u2022 Stand on one foot, with about a 20-degree knee bend, and with the dumbbell or kettlebell placed to the inside of the supporting foot (elevated if needed to accomodate flexibility). The other leg is in full extension behind the body and is not allowed to be externally or internally rotated. In other words, the toe of the rear leg should point toward the ground at all times. External rotation of the leg will allow the hip to open up and throw off the mechanics. \u2022 Hinging at the hip, mimic a sitting movement and push your buttocks backward. Reach down and grab the weight with the arm opposite the standing leg. Use the free arm to balance. Imagine lifting the weight in a see-saw-like motion. 6 A significant amount of rotational torque is generated when you stand on one leg and pull a weight with the opposite arm. Preventing this rotation requires core stability, which is exactly what we\u2019re trying to develop. \u2022 Set the weight down between each repetition. Gray works with high- profile athletes, and his deadlifting injury rate is zero. This rule (sets of one) is why. If you are aiming for a set of five repetitions, for example, what you\u2019re really performing is nine repetitions, five loaded and four unloaded interspersed between them. Here\u2019s what it looks like: Reach down, deadlift the weight up to standing, set it back down under control, stand back up without the weight, regain your composure and posture, clear a breath, then go back down and repeat. Learn to hinge the hip and push into the floor with your foot before regrabbing\u2014setting up the rep is as important as the rep itself. Just as with the chop and lift, going from unloaded to loaded is the whole point. Page 415 Deadlift Guidelines from Gray 1. The deadlift is a forward bending motion in appearance only. It is actually a sitting-back motion that puts the rear end far behind the heels. If deadlifting with one or two legs, the tibia (shin bones) should remain as close to vertical as possible. 2. Keep the grip strong, as that will keep your shoulders safe. Retraction (pulling back) of the shoulder is not necessary. Using a heavier weight, and therefore a firm grip, will allow proper reflex contraction of the rotator cuff musculature. 3. Fully"

    "text": "extend and straighten the back leg. It should look like an extension of the spine. If your chest goes down two inches, you lift your back heel two inches. If your chest goes up two inches, you lower that back heel two inches. They should be perfectly connected. 4. Lift a respectable amount of weight, even if you must reduce the range of motion to do so. Gray is constantly amazed how some personal trainers use five-pound chrome dumbbells on individuals who routinely carry children or suitcases that weigh 35\u201345 pounds. In bending and lifting motions like the deadlift, a light weight will encourage elbow flexion (bending) and shoulder shrugging, all of which is bad news. The point of the deadlift is to keep repetitions low, elicit neuromuscular reactions, and create core stability in a hip drive. The repetitions should be kept between one and five, evoking strength. This is not done for hypertrophy (muscular growth); it is done to create a stable base from which to pull. It\u2019s possible to restrict the range of motion of the deadlift as you work up to full range of motion. You can, for example, deadlift a kettlebell off of a crate or lift a dumbbell off a step or platform. If it\u2019s a significant weight and you are demonstrating the proper hip hinge, you\u2019re going to benefit, even if the weight travels a short distance. Rather than skip the exercise, just elevate the weight until you have control. As you progress, lower it gradually and eventually lift it off the ground. How do you put it all together?

If it works and it\u2019s legal, it\u2019s fair game. The Science and Business of Running Faster The NFL Scouting Combine is the ultimate job interview. Once a year in February, the 330 best college football players are invited to Indiana\u2019s Lucas Oil Stadium, and the top NFL coaches and talent scouts spend a week determining their worth. At the top of the list in importance are the \u201cmeasurables\u201d\u2014physical tests that allow each of the 330 players to be measured Page 420 against every other. These tests include a vertical jump, the 40-yard dash, a three-cone agility drill, and the bench press for repetitions with 225 pounds. The NFL draft, later held in Radio City Music Hall, is the first time the teams can make offers and negotiate contracts with potential players. Players are picked over seven rounds, and with rare exceptions, the earlier you are picked, the more you are paid. How much can Combine results affect ultimate pay? A lot. One inch or one- fifth of a second can make the difference between millions of dollars and nothing at all. Almost all of the players come into the Combine signed with sports agents, whose job it is to make sure their clients are worth as much as possible. The sales pitches of many top agents, intended to snag the cream of the crop, include a name: \u201cIf you sign with me, I can get you trained with DeFranco.\u201d Joe DeFranco, the Yoda of the Combine, is best known for creating monsters who jump higher and run faster than they should. The NFL has had to change the rules to keep up with him. To wit: the three-cone drill. The rules of the three-cone drill are straightforward. First, the athlete must get in a three-point stance (both feet and one hand down) behind the line, just like the start of a 40-yard dash. Second, the athlete must run five yards, touch the far- side line with his right hand ( not left), then immediately run back and touch the starting line with his right hand, after which he sprints across the opposite line. One of Joe\u2019s athletes, Mike Richardson of Notre Dame, ran the fastest three- cone drill ever recorded at an official NFL Combine or Pro Day: 1 6.2 seconds. Joe explains how he did it: Since the rules of the test dictate that you must touch both lines with your RIGHT hand, I discovered that it would be much more efficient to get in a less-common \u201cleft-handed\u201d stance when performing this test.\u2026 Simply put, the left-handed stance enables the athlete to cover the 1st 10 yards in two fewer steps; when you\u2019re talking about TENTHS of a second, two steps makes a huge difference! Taking 2 less steps can shave up to 4 tenths of a second off of this test. And when we\u2019re talking about the NFL Combine tests, 4 tenths of a second is an eternity that can mean millions of dollars for an athlete. Some of the NFL scouts now disallow left-handed starts at the Combine. This is amusing since some athletes are, well, left-handed."

Or was he using the favorite trick of PR- savvy trainers: babysitting genetic freaks for a year and then basking in their performances? Amid 600-pound tires and chains, I had come to his storage facility to find out. Forty-eight hours later, I had: \u2022 Increased my vertical jump three inches (matching the gym\u2019s single-session improvement record) \u2022 Improved my 40-yard dash by 0.33 seconds (beating the previous single- session record of two-tenths of a second) This chapter and the next will explain how you can replicate what I did, starting with my personal nemesis (there\u2019s a reason I chose wrestling over basketball): The vertical jump. The Vertical Jump DeFranco started me off with an abbreviated warm-up, videos of which can be seen at www.fourhourbody.com/defranco : Normal jumping jacks \u00d7 10 Seal jacks \u00d7 10 (open and close the arms in front of the chest) Reverse lunge \u00d7 5 (each side) Side lunge \u00d7 5 (each side) Leg swings forward and backward \u00d7 10 (each side) Pogo jumps \u00d7 20 secs. (jump on the balls of your feet with legs straight as fast as possible) We then approached the altar of air: the Vertec. It is, Vertec\u2019s marketing department forgive me, a pole with sticks that rotate when struck. The highest stick you hit determines your vertical leap. 2 Page 422 \u201cShow me your best.\u201d So I did. Twenty-one inches. My second and third attempts yielded an equally unimpressive 22 inches. STARTING POINT: 22 INCHES As I prepared to receive my first set of instructions, the asshole walked in. Correction: The Asshole. \u201cHey, Asshole!\u201d DeFranco shouted over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s up!\u201d The Asshole offered back. DeFranco looked back at me and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not derogatory at all. That\u2019s just what he is. It\u2019s his name.\u201d Outside the gym, The Asshole is known as Mike Guadango. His story was typical of DeFranco\u2019s acolytes. He had been cut from the University of Delaware baseball team his freshman year. He responded by transferring to William Paterson University and sacrificing his body to DeFranco. Twelve months later, he was first-team All-American. The Asshole could now do 50 consecutive military chins and, at 5\u20329\u2033, had become a YouTube celebrity for a jump from standstill onto a face-height 55-inch box. 3 Not bad for someone known in DeFranco\u2019s clan for his lack of natural gifts. The Asshole took a comfortable seat to enjoy the spectacle. DeFranco\u2019s first round of training began with corrections. Flaw #1: Too Little Shoulder Drive \u201cShoulders are prime movers in the jump and contribute up to 20% of your height. Try running a 40-yard dash with your arms by your sides and you\u2019ll get the idea. For the vertical jump, the speed of your descent into a half-squat will correlate to the max height. Really use your upper-body strength and throw your arms down as fast as you can, recoiling with the same speed.\u201d DeFranco encouraged me to start with my arms overhead like an Olympic diver, using the additional distance for increased velocity downward. This would maximize elastic recoil. My dominant right arm would then be the only arm extended overhead to hit the sticks. Flaw #2: Pulling the Extended Arm Back at the Apex of the Jump My arm was retracted at the highest point, as if I were spiking a volleyball, and I was hitting the sticks on the way down. It needed to be retracted on the way up. Flaw #3: Too Wide a Squat Stance Page 423 My squat stance, just outside of hip width, was too wide and decreased my standing height by one to two inches. I needed to place my feet just inside the hips and keep my back flat as I squatted. I had to keep my eyes on the sticks at all times, except for at the very bottom on the squat. Shaking out my arms and legs, I ran through the checklist and took a few deep breaths. Then I jumped again. 3RD ATTEMPT: 24 INCHES I had just gained two inches on my"

    "text": "vertical. \u201cWho taught you to jump with your feet together?\u201d The Asshole shouted from behind me. It seemed that, in an effort to start with my arms overhead like an Olympic diver, I\u2019d also stood like an Olympic diver, with my feet firmly together. I didn\u2019t even notice. How had I managed to squat like that? Four or five things might not seem like much, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot to keep in your head for a maximal-speed movement. DeFranco pulled out a stretching mat. It was time for more corrections. Flaw #4: Tight Hip Flexors \u201cNormally, we don\u2019t use static stretching. The hip flexors are the one exception. The objective is to put them to sleep, as they can restrict maximal leg extension.\u201d Static stretching is what most people think of as stretching\u2014go into a stretch and hold it for 10 seconds or more. It turns out that this de facto approach can temporarily decrease the strength of the muscles and connective tissue being stretched, increasing the likelihood of injury. In this unusual exception, we wanted to temporarily elongate and weaken one area and one area only: the hip flexors. The hip flexor stretches are performed 30 seconds to two minutes before a jump, and the nondominant side is stretched first. In my case, that was my left side. Each side is held for 30 seconds. Page 424 On the right: Hold this position. 4TH ATTEMPT: 25 INCHES I was pleased with our progress, and so was DeFranco: \u201cThat\u2019d be a million dollars if you could play football and were in the NFL. \u201cMid to low 20s is the average for high school players in this gym. Going from 29 inches to 30 inches in the Combine puts you in a new bracket altogether. A new tax bracket too.\u201d One of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Miles Austin, had a 42-inch vertical at 220 pounds. Brian Cushing, who was then leading the AFC in tackles, weighed 250 pounds and had a 35-inch vertical. \u201cCush\u201d had started with DeFranco at age 17 and was a first- round draft pick. Cush could now bench-press 225 pounds for 35 reps. He could also put on a 20-pound weight vest, sit in a chair, and jump directly from the seated position onto a 50-inch box. Yep, a freaking mutant. My performance didn\u2019t compare well, but I had gained three inches on my vertical in 20 minutes and tied the gym record for single-session improvement. The next morning, however, a much bigger challenge awaited: Sprinting.

The starting height\u20140\u2033\u2014is the height of your fingertips extended overhead when your feet are flat on the ground. This allows scouts to compare a 5\u203210\u2033 player to a 6\u20324\u2033 player. 3. www.fourhourbody.com/asshole Page 427 HACKING THE NFL COMBINE II Running Faster Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up.

It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the lion or the gazelle. When the sun comes up, you\u2019d better be moving. \u2014Maurice Greene, 5-time world champion 100-meter sprinter KING GEORGE DINER, 721 HAMBURG TURNPIKE I t was 8:00 A.M. EST (5:00 A.M. PST on my physical clock), and Joe and I were waking up to a classic New Jersey diner breakfast: omelets and never-ending cups of strong, bitter coffee. I pulled out a pad and started the questions. \u201cWho\u2019s the best strength coach no one knows?\u201d I asked. Answer: Buddy Morris from the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cFavorite coach for functional strength?\u201d Answer: Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell. 4 \u201cFavorite stretching expert?\u201d Answer: Anne Frederick, whose clinic, Stretch to Win, I had visited in Tempe, Arizona, just six months earlier. I\u2019d left a session with her husband with more hip mobility than I\u2019d experienced in a decade. \u201cFavorite sprint or speed coach?\u201d Answer: Charlie Francis. Ah, Charlie. Charlie Francis is also my favorite speed coach. Unfortunately, he\u2019s most famous for training 100-meter gold medalist Ben Johnson, who tested positive for steroid use (stanozolol) in the 1988 Olympics. Few realize the sophistication of Charlie\u2019s training techniques. 5 He was a legitimate genius. Francis was first and foremost a biomechanics and training expert, not a chemist. One of his innovations involved using extremely short distances and training at 95% or more of max effort\u2014never between 75% and 95%. Less than 95% was too slow to be speed work, and the higher volume accompanying slower speeds was too hard to recover from within 24 hours. Joe DeFranco adapted these concepts, among others, and prospered. Case in point: Rather than running 400 meters or more to build a base for sprinting and then working down, as is common, DeFranco had one of his Division III football Page 428 players, the aforementioned Miles Austin, spend more than 80% of this sprint training on 10-yard dashes. Miles focused on perfecting the starting stance, the exact number of steps for optimal speed, and the precise posture for sustained acceleration. Despite the fact that Miles ran just three 40-yard dashes among more than 100 10-yard dashes, he ran 4.67 seconds in the 40-yard dash at the Combine and was later clocked at an official 4.47 seconds. If Joe was a Combine specialist, he appeared to be a 40-yard dash savant: \u201cFor improvement, the vert is 9 out of 10 people. The 40 is 1,000 out of 1,000.\u201d Them\u2019s strong words. I had visions of breaking Ben Johnson\u2019s record on little more than a Greek omelet and several gallons of shitty coffee. It was going to be a good day. The Warm-Up First things came first: warm-ups. I used basic soccer cleats without spikes, and Joe underscored the importance of mimicking the habits of good sprinting in the warm-ups themselves: 6 using arm action, etc. GENERAL MOVEMENT PREP 20 yds. of skipping \u00d7 2 Reverse lunge \u00d7 6 reps one side, then 6 reps on the other side Backward cycling 7 (for quadriceps and hip flexors) 20 yds. \u00d7 2 Side shuffle in half-squat 8 20 yds. \u00d7 2 Page 429 Notice that I bend the supporting knee first, bringing the knee over the toes before I extend the opposite leg backward. GROUND-BASED DYNAMIC STRETCHING AND MUSCLE ACTIVATION 9 10 \u00d7 roll-overs into V-sits 10 \u00d7 fire hydrants (to each side) 10 \u00d7 mountain climbers 10 FREQUENCY DRILLING TO PREP THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Perform as many repetitions as possible of each exercise in the time allotted: Pogo jumps \u00d7 20 secs. Half-squat deep \u201cwide-outs\u201d \u00d7 2 sets of 5 secs. (10-sec. rest between) 11 Joe kept the warm-up short and gave me time to recover. One of the oldest tricks in the training world, he explained, is to fatigue an athlete prior to their \u201cbefore\u201d testing with an extensive warm-up, then retest them later with a minimal warm-up. Voil\u00e0, instant measurable improvement. Trixy coaches."

    "text": "The Set-Up My times wouldn\u2019t depend on DeFranco\u2019s eyesight or judgment. We\u2019d be using the Brower system, the same technology used at the \u201cbig show\u201d of the Combine. My finish time would be clocked automatically when I passed between two paired laser detectors at the 40-yard line, both of which were synced to his hand- held counter. As a baseline, I ran two 10-yard dashes with no coaching: Dash #1: 2.12 secs. Dash #2: 2.07 secs. Then I impressed Joe with a blistering starting 40-yard dash of \u2026 5.94 seconds. \u201cThe good news is that you broke six seconds,\u201d Joe announced as he pointed to the screen on the hand-held. \u201cTo paint that in a positive light, it\u2019s not bad if you\u2019re a below-average 320-pound lineman.\u201d Pacing back and forth with a bounce in his step, he looked up at me with an Page 430 ear-to-ear smile: \u201cWhere to start.\u2026 You are going to make me look good today! Big day for Joe!\u201d It was time to let Joe work his magic. The \u201cwhere to start\u201d was easy: the start position. The Brower system. The Devil\u2019s in the Details My first step had gone nowhere. Quite literally. My leg had gone from behind the line to the start line, the zero-meter mark. Losing a step might not impact a marathon, but it\u2019s an enormous handicap in the 40-yard dash. My untrained start position compared to the trained start position. THE FIRST ROUND OF POSITIONAL CORRECTIONS Page 431 1. If right-handed, put your right hand down and left leg forward. Left-handers do the opposite. This will be optimal 90% of the time. 2. To set up as a right-hander: stand with the toes of the left foot roughly one foot behind the line, then touch the toes of the right foot to the back of the left heel. Next, spread the right foot out so both feet are hip width and no wider. Support yourself on both hands, placed in front of the line (to place your weight forward), then bring the right hand to the line. 3. Put three fingers of the right hand on the line: index finger and middle finger together, plus the thumb. This caused too much pain in my thumb, so I used the index and middle knuckles with the thumb. 4. Just before you take off, the left arm, bent at a 90-degree angle, will come up so that your hand is next to your hip (see photo on previous page). 5. Drive and aim the first step with your rear leg to land three feet (one yard) from your lead toe. The result: my first trained 10-yard attempt clocked at 1.99 from a 2.07- second original, a 0.08 second improvement. ADDING CORRECT ARM POSITION AND MOVEMENT I had placed most of my weight on my legs, resulting in a negative arm angle . In other words, the line from my fingertips to my shoulder pointed up and behind me. This is bad. It meant I had to pause and lift my arm before taking the first step. To correct this, I attempted to have my shoulder slightly ahead of my fingers and replace my arms. In Joe\u2019s words, I was to \u201cleave the lead arm behind\u201d and drive it backward instead of lifting it. I would naturally fall forward as I removed the third leg of the tripod, and driving the right arm back would help me drive my right leg forward. More weight forward, however, meant less sole contact with the ground, and my rear foot slipped both times I practiced this. The solution Joe suggested was Nike Vapors, which, unlike common cleats, have small teeth at the toe of the shoe. Stuck with my standard soccer booties, I hoped the new forward pressure would compensate for less traction. It did: the next 10-yard attempt clocked at 1.91 from a 2.07 original\u2014a 0.16 overall improvement. FOCUSING ON SUSTAINED RUNNING POSITION AND FEWER STEPS Joe placed a string about three feet from my lead toe and prescribed the Page 432 following: 1. From the start position, keep your head down but your eyes on the string, where you want your first step to land. 2. Ensure that your knee is ahead of your toes when you land that first step. 3. For the entire 10 yards, keep your chin tucked and your upper body ahead of your lower body. 4. Take the fewest steps"

    "text": "possible (seven steps or fewer for my limb length), which will paradoxically feel slower due to more ground contact. I took a breath. The checklist was getting long and the setup was taking correspondingly longer. When I passed the 10-yard mark, it felt a lot slower. It wasn\u2019t: this fifth attempt clocked at 1.85 from a 2.07 original\u2014a 0.22 overall improvement. Now it was time to retest the 40-yard dash. \u201cJust Run Your 10\u201d \u201cTo transition to the 40, people forget all they learned in the 10. Just run your 10. Run the best 10 you can. Don\u2019t worry about the rest but finish to the 40-yard line. But \u2026 run that 10 like it\u2019s for Olympic gold.\u201d That was it? Five 10-yard dash practice runs and less than 15 minutes of coaching? I took one warm-up run at about 60% of max effort to shake out the cobwebs. \u201cReady?\u201d I asked Joe. \u201cReady.\u201d Then I hovered in the starting stance for what seemed like an eternity, making tiny adjustments, trying to keep the dozen or so points straight. And I was off. For the first time in a long time, I felt fast. I kept my head down and body forward as I blew past the 10-yard mark. I could sense I was nearing the 40-yard finish and looked up, at which point I felt a sharp pull. Before I could blink, I had passed the 40 and was decelerating into a jog. My right hamstring felt odd. Page 433 \u201cNice!\u201d Joe yelled out from the start line, and I headed over. \u201c5.61 seconds.\u201d He showed me the reading on the hand-held receiver and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve broken the gym record for a one session improvement. It was two-tenths of a second, and this is more than three-tenths of a second.\u201d \u201cMy hamstring feels a little tight,\u201d I mentioned as I headed back to the starting line. Joe stopped and looked at me. \u201cIn that case, we\u2019re done for today.\u201d He continued: \u201cI\u2019ve learned from experience\u2014I\u2019m older and wiser than I once was\u2014that you stop when the hamstrings feel tight. That\u2019s a sign of a pending tear.\u201d \u201cBut it feels so tight. Shouldn\u2019t I stretch it a bit?\u201d \u201cNo, that\u2019s the biggest and most common mistake. It feels like it\u2019s contracting, so people stretch it, but it\u2019s already overstretched. You need ice and Hannah Montana.\u201d Hannah Montana? \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \u201cIce and arnica montana.\u201d I\u2019d misheard him, of course. Arnica montana, not Hannah Montana, is also known as wolf\u2019s bane. It\u2019s a European flowering plant that contains a flavonoid called helenalin, which has made it popular among professional athletes for anti- inflammation. DeFranco believed that, had I not pulled my hamstring, I would have reached between 5.51 and 5.53 that session and then dropped another one- to two-tenths after a week of additional training. Lesson learned: keep your chin tucked and don\u2019t look up. It pulls your torso upright and leads to striking with the heel, which can cause hamstring tears. The forces generated in the 40-yard dash are obscene. Keep in mind that DeFranco coaches athletes who can deadlift 600 pounds for repetitions, and his advice to bodybuilders who want to develop their \u201chammies\u201d is simple: Sprint. I\u2019d be getting back to sprinting, but the first order of business was ice and Hannah Montana. I needed to heal. The next leg of my journey was going to require a hell of a lot more than 40 yards. Page 434 Is there anything I could have done to prevent my hamstring pull? If there is one injury Joe understands, it is the hamstring pull. His pre-hab prescription was effectively threefold: 1. Train the natural glute-ham raise. Nothing in the weight room can mimic the demands of sprinting. The next best thing, though, is the natural glute-ham raise, which builds an incredible foundation of eccentric strength in the hamstring. This helps prevent pulls and tears during the foot-strike portion of sprinting, when the load is greatest. The Asshole demonstrates proper form here: www.fourhourbody.com/asshole-demo . According to Joe, athletes who can perform strict natural glute-ham raises rarely pull hamstrings. If you don\u2019t have the equipment, a partner can hold your"

See the Sorinex machine, which I have at home, in the \u201cTools and Tricks.\u201d 2. Focus on hip extension strength. Forget leg curls and knee flexion, with the one exception of the glute-ham raise. Otherwise, you should focus on strong hip extension. To prevent pulls and increase sprint speed, focus on these movements: Reverse hyperextensions (reverse \u201chypers\u201d) Regular hyperextensions Kettlebell or dumbbell swings Sled dragging (train both upright posture and a 45-degree \u201cacceleration\u201d lean) Supine hip thrusts (see www.fourhourbody.com/hip ) If you can\u2019t do reverse hypers or a natural glute-ham raise, or if you lack the equipment, DeFranco and his acolytes recommend supine hip thrusts (see the video demo above), which can also be done with a barbell for added resistance (see my video with 415 pounds here: www.fourhourbody.com/hipthrusts ). I love this exercise. It is also the money move for quickly relieving back pain Page 435 from too much time at the laptop. Random digression: as I write this at 1:45 A.M. in a hotel caf\u00e9 in South Africa, I have just finished a nice set of supine hip thrusts between a couch and a coffee table. I am the only night owl here. Reverse hyper(extension) on a bench and Swiss ball. It\u2019s easier than it looks. A native Amaxhosa 12 cleaning woman just stopped to look at me as if I had lobsters crawling out of my ears, so I told her that the waitress had promised me free water, but only if I did the sexy booty dance. She was not impressed. 3. Keep your hip flexors flexible. The most underrated way to improve stride length and prevent hamstring pulls is to (and this should sound familiar) keep your hip flexors flexible. See the hip flexor stretches in the last chapter. When your hip flexors are tight, it creates constant tension and a constant pull on the hamstrings, which is a recipe for tears. Tight hip flexors also prevent you from reaching full stride length. Upon extending your leg back into the turf, the stretch-reflex in your hip flexors causes them to contract prematurely and pull your leg back up. People with tight hip flexors take short, choppy steps when they run. Sometimes they look fast due to a high stride rate, but Joe calls it \u201cgoing nowhere fast\u201d because they are not covering any real ground. Stretch those sons-a-bitches. Page 436 So what happened with Hannah Montana? I had used topical arnica before, and it had worked well. This time, I was taking Boiron Arnica Montana 30C pellets, an oral version that was the only option at the closest GNC. I started at five pellets, six times a day\u2014twice the recommended dose. Risk of overdose? Not likely. \u201c30C,\u201d which I looked up that evening, tells you all you need to know. This consumable version of arnica, unlike the creams I\u2019d used in the past, was a homeopathic remedy. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician, pioneered the field of homeopathy in 1796, if the term \u201cpioneer\u201d can be applied to alternative \u201cmedicine\u201d founded on concepts like mass dilution and beatings with horse-hair implements: Homeopaths use a process called \u201cdynamisation\u201d or \u201cpotentisation\u201d whereby a substance is diluted with alcohol or distilled water and then vigorously shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body in a process called \u201csuccussion.\u201d \u2026 Hahnemann believed that the process of succussion activated the vital energy of the diluted substance. Riiiight. Back to 30C. 30C indicates a 10 \u221260 dilution, the dilution most recommended by Hahnemann. 30C would require giving 2 billion doses per second to 6 billion people for 4 billion years to deliver a single molecule of the original material to any one person. Put another way, if I diluted one-third of a drop of liquid into all the water on earth, it would produce a remedy with a concentration of about 13C, more than twice the \u201cstrength\u201d of our 30C arnica. Most homeopathic remedies"

    "text": "in liquid are indistinguishable from water and don\u2019t contain a single molecule of active medicine. I found this particularly bothersome. Bothersome because I appeared to heal faster using oral 30C arnica. There are a few potential explanations: HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES WORK AS ADVERTISED The water actually retains some \u201cessential property\u201d of the original substance Page 437 because of the beatings and shakings. I give this a 0% probability. It violates the most basic laws of science and makes my head hurt. THE PLACEBO EFFECT I didn\u2019t realize it was a homeopathic remedy until after four or five doses, and I had been told it could reduce pain by up to 50% in 24 hours. Placebo is strong stuff. People can become intoxicated from alcohol placebos, and \u201cplacebo\u201d knee surgeries for osteoarthritis, where incisions are made but nothing is repaired, can produce results that rival the real deal. This explanation gets my vote. Now, if I could just forget what I read on the label, I could repeat it next time. REGRESSION TOWARD THE MEAN Imagine you catch a cold or get the flu. It\u2019s going to get worse and worse, then better and better until you are back to normal. The severity of symptoms, as is true with many injuries, will look something like a bell curve. The bottom flat line, representing normalcy, is the mean . When are you most likely to try the quackiest shit you can get your hands on? That miracle duck extract Aunt Susie swears by when not talking about crystals? Naturally, when your symptoms are the worst and nothing seems to help. This is the very top of the bell curve, at the peak of the roller coaster before you head back down. Naturally heading back down is regression toward the mean . If you are a fallible human, as we all are, you might misattribute getting better to the duck extract, but it was just coincidental timing. The body had healed itself, as could be predicted from the bell curve\u2013like timeline of symptoms. This is a very common mistake, even among smart people. SOME UNEXPLAINED MECHANISM \u2019Tis possible that there is some as-yet-unexplained mechanism through which homeopathy works. Some mechanism that science will eventually explain. Until something even remotely plausible comes along, though, I\u2019ll do my best to scratch my psora (an itch \u201cmiasm\u201d that Hahnemann felt caused epilepsy, cancer, and deafness) with at least one molecule of active substance.

Platform shoes and colored leather circled around the bar and lounge, filling the waiting hours with Facebook and text messaging, interspersed with shouts of \u201cDude!\u201d and whispers of \u201cDo you have any E?\u201d I was admiring the face piercings when a 6\u20322\u2033, 193-pound punk rocker sat down in the red plush chair in front of me. He looked like a cross between Henry Rollins, Keanu Reeves, and a Navy SEAL. Brian MacKenzie. He shook my hand with a smile and I noticed the word \u201cUNSCARED\u201d tattooed across both hands, one letter on each of eight fingers. Within minutes, it became clear that we shared a similar brand of enthusiasm. The absurd kind that often overrides self-preservation. In the early days of his endurance experiments, he had wanted to test the effects of 20-second sprints with 10-second rest intervals\u2014the famous Tabata protocol. 13 Brian somehow decided it was a good idea to start on the treadmill at an obscene 10 miles per hour at a 15-degree incline. He was forced to downshift to 9 miles per hour on a 10-degree grade after one and a half minutes. Then he flew off the back of the treadmill frozen in form, like a human gingerbread man. He landed on the floor with his legs locked, where he remained for more than five minutes at near-fibrillation. His two training partners, rather than help him up, stood over him laughing and pointing at his face, repeating over and over again: \u201cDude, that was AWESOME! Buahahaha!\u201d My kinda guy. I downed the last third of my Merlot and got down to business. \u201cSo, what do you really think you could do with me in eight to twelve weeks?\u201d I explained my apparent handicaps, and he leaned forward on his elbows: \u201cNone of that matters. I could get you to a half marathon in eight weeks. That\u2019s assuming you have a baseline and can run a 5K in less than 24 minutes [3.1 miles at 8 minutes per mile or less].\u201d \u201cWhat if I have never run 5Ks?\u201d \u201cFine. I\u2019d have you do intervals first and build up to it. You have no shin splints or plantar fasciitis, right?\u201d \u201cRight.\u201d \u201cAnd we have 12 weeks?\u201d Page 443 \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, then we can make miracles happen.\u201d He\u2019d taken one trainee, nicknamed \u201cRookie,\u201d to a mountainous 50K (31.2 mile) ultramarathon in 11 weeks. Prior to that, Rookie had never run more than four miles at a stretch. Another trainee, a 43-year-old marathoner with an 8:30 mile pace, couldn\u2019t even complete three 400-meter sprints at the beginning of training. She had \u201cno gears,\u201d as Brian put it: she couldn\u2019t maintain a 7:30 mile pace for even three minutes. Two months prior to the New York City marathon, Brian had her do 16 minutes of total sprint training per week, in addition to four conditioning workouts per week using weights and calisthenics.

She finished the marathon in 3 hours and 32 minutes\u2014an 8-minute pace, 30 seconds per mile less than her previous time\u2014and she would have finished much sooner had she not stopped to help another runner at the end. Had she not stopped, Brian estimated her truer finish time at 3:30, a 7:28.8 per mile pace. Brian had given her gears with 16 minutes per week. The Journey from High Volume to Low Volume Brian started in sports as a short-course swimmer. His coach couldn\u2019t get him to swim more than 100 meters without blowing apart at the seams. In late 2000, he was conned into a short-course \u201csprint\u201d triathlon by a 47-year- old friend who was a 13-time Ironman finisher. It was short but sweet: a 500- meter swim, a 13-mile bike, and a 5-kilometer run. He didn\u2019t blow apart this time, partially because he wasn\u2019t competing against swimming specialists. Much to his surprise, he loved it so much that he signed up for the Ironman the next day. He\u2019d been bitten by the bug. Brian climbed up the ranks of the triathlon world with an Olympic-distance race, a half-Ironman, and then the Canadian Ironman. He trained 24 to 30 hours Page 444 per week, just as his competitors did, including roughly eight miles of swimming, 200+ miles of cycling, and 50+ miles of running. It was par for the course in the endurance world, but it wasn\u2019t good for the body, his relationships, or much of anything else. He was severely overtrained, his wife was unhappy, and he had no life. In 2001, he was introduced to the controversial Dr. Nicolas Romanov, a figure we\u2019ll revisit, which marked a turning point. Brian began to question the logic of high-volume, low-speed aerobic training and started to commit sacrilege in the world of long-form punishment. He decided to focus on less. In June of 2006, he ran the Western States 100-mile endurance race, which has more than 17,000 vertical feet of climbing and more than 22,000 feet of downhill knee destruction. He finished in just over 26 hours. Compared to the mere 11-hour Ironman, he\u2019d reduced his training from 30 hours per week to 10.5 hours per week. But the 10.5 hours per week was still too much, and his body was still suffering, as was his marriage. On September 15, 2007, after further refinement, Brian completed what is considered the fourth-toughest 100-mile run in the world, the Angeles Crest 100. 14 This time, he averaged just 6.5 hours of training per week, which included strength training (almost three hours), CrossFit, intervals, and pace work. His body had learned to become aerobic at the higher paces, even during speed training. Just before adopting this training mix, his one-rep max in the squat was 250 pounds. 15 Three weeks before the race, he could easily squat 240 pounds for six consecutive reps, and he hadn\u2019t put on a single pound of body weight. Now he was faster at every distance. It didn\u2019t matter if it was 100 meters or 100 miles. So You Want to be a Runner? Let\u2019s Try 400-Meter Repeats Back in Louisville, Colorado, 14 hours after my poor decision to drink wine, I was experiencing a unique clarity of thought. It was the clarity of thought that only comes from repeatedly feeling as though your lungs and head are going to explode. First, I ran 400 meters \u00d7 4, at 95% max effort, with 1:30 of rest in between. Page 445 Then I ran (or attempted to run) 100-meter repeats for ten minutes straight with ten seconds of rest in between runs. I didn\u2019t stand a chance in either trial. Halfway through my second 400-meter repeat, I was breathing entirely through my mouth like an asthmatic German Shepherd, and after the last I had to crouch down like Gollum and hold my knees to keep from vomiting. For the 100-meter repeats, I had to stop after six and hold onto a picnic table to keep from falling over, and though I jumped back into the drill, I had to skip four"

    "text": "repeats out of a total of about 20. There were a few things I realized at that moment. Namely, to run anything approaching an ultramarathon without doing myself permanent damage, I would need to ace a trifecta of preparation, biomechanics, and training. The training would also need to redefine discomfort. Thankfully, according to Brian, it would be brief. Preparation: The Undercarriage 4 WEEKS It isn\u2019t your lungs or your slow-twitch muscle fibers that will fail first in long- distance running. It\u2019s your suspension. To sustain the repeated impact of a mere 5K, between 2,000 and 2,500 foot strikes for most runners, you need to ensure that your ligaments and tendons are both thick and elastic enough for the abuse; and you need to ensure that the proper muscle groups are firing in the right sequence. I suffered a minor hamstring pull after the 400s (same leg as at DeFranco\u2019s) and experienced excruciating lower back pain for the next three hours, as did several other aspiring long-distance runners. Why? My hip flexors and quads were too tight, common among desk workers, which made me bend forward at the hip during sprints. This then forced my hamstrings to attempt the job of the much larger and stronger glutes, which Page 446 were inhibited. There you have it\u2014overloading and a hamstring pull. The tight hip flexors pulled on the lower lumbar spine, which explained the sore back. I also had pain on the inside of both knees after practicing foot pulls (coming shortly), which appeared to be caused by two problems: tight quads and weak vastus medialis obliques (VMO), the teardrop-shaped muscle on the inside of the front of the legs. 16 Last but not least, I had acute soreness throughout both feet and ankles. The ligaments, tendons, and small muscles of the feet and ankles were underdeveloped. In other words, I wasn\u2019t ready to run. Before I could consider serious training, I needed good suspension. To do otherwise would be asking for injuries that could plague me for months or even years. The \u201cmarathon monks\u201d of Mount Hiei in Japan run and walk the equivalent of an ultramarathon every day for six years, some averaging 84 kilometers per day for the last 100 days of training. I wasn\u2019t looking promising as a monk. \u201cAm I ready for the Olympics, coach?\u201d I jokingly asked Tertius Kohn PhD as he sat me down in his office at the Sports Science Institute of South Africa. Five days earlier, I\u2019d had a biopsy tube the size of a pencil jammed into the side of my thigh 17 to skip the theory and look directly at the limits of my muscle. Much teeth grinding, three muscle samples, and a myography lab later, I finally had answers. Tertius looked at me with a serious expression. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor, so I like to speak plainly. You might not like what I\u2019m going to tell you, but I\u2019m going to tell you anyway.\u201d \u201cUmmm \u2026 Okay.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have trouble finishing a 10K.\u201d I nodded. Page 447 \u201cIn fact, I think you\u2019d have trouble finishing a 5K.\u201d This wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted to hear, but three months of obsessing over ultraendurance had taken me many places, and this was one of them: enzymes. CS, 3HAD, LDH, and PFK are all enzymes that limit energy production through different pathways. South African Xhosa mid- and long-distance runners, for example, have high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which allows them to recycle lactate at higher than normal rates. More LDH appears to mean less accumulation of plasma lactate (more commonly referred to as \u201clactic acid\u201d), which means less debilitating muscle burn. In Kenyan runners, higher levels of another enzyme, 3- HAD, mean a greater ability to use fat instead of carbohydrate during sub- maximal exercise. How did I measure up? I am the one under the line. Hear me roar: The numbers reflect the percentage compared to untrained human subjects. African antelopes and trained endurance athletes are in the mix for contrast. (Credit: Tertius A. Kohn PhD from the UCT/MRC Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine."

    "text": "Special thanks also to Prof. Tim Noakes and the staff at ESSM.) As Tertius showed me the numbers, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. How the hell did I have negative numbers? Despite all of my training and all my efforts, my enzyme levels were worse than a Homer Simpson couch potato. So much for the \u201cendurance preference\u201d conclusion from the genetics testing. 18 Based on my raw materials, I seemed screwed for both endurance and Page 448 power. In my mind, I flipped through the suitable sports: Competitive eating? Going down slides? \u201cYou are \u2026 very, very average,\u201d Tertius would repeat several times over the next 30 minutes of discussion. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not upset. I\u2019m a scientist and like to state the facts simply.\u201d By that point, I wasn\u2019t upset. In fact, I was elated on some perverse level. I was worse than average. This meant that any future achievements could be almost completely attributed to training effect. It took a huge variable (genetics) largely out of the picture. If I could do it, others stood a good chance\u2014actually, a better chance\u2014of doing the same. That leads us back to our story. I allocated four weeks to pre-training preparation, in addition to using ART 19 for the quads, hamstrings, and hip flexors. The following five movements and running prep were what I focused on. Stretches are held for at least 90 seconds and performed on both sides. 1. HIP FLEXOR (ILIOPSOAS) AND QUAD FLEXIBILITY Here, Kelly demonstrates the \u201csuper quad\u201d stretch on a couch. Frame 1 is variation A, which is easier, and frame 2 is variation B. I prefer to use B on the floor in front of the couch, with my rear foot resting (ankle bent) on top of the sitting cushions. It\u2019s critical to keep your spine neutral. Slightly contracting your abs, as seen in frame 2, helps. Kelly illustrates bad form in frame 3: back arched and abs protruding forward. Page 449 2. PELVIC SYMMETRY AND GLUTE FLEXIBILITY This is similar to \u201cpigeon pose\u201d in yoga, but using a table makes it easier to perform and harder to cheat. Place the leg as seen in frame 1 on a table top, knee bent 90 degrees. Lean directly forward (12 o\u2019clock) for 90 seconds, then to both 10:00 A.M . (frame 2) and 2:00 P.M . for 90 seconds each. Notice that one hand is placed on the foot itself for support. If your knee bothers you, you can rotate and slide the ankle off the table (frame 3), which is what I do. In this case, you place one hand on the ankle for support. If you work at a computer for long periods of time, this ankle-off version can even be used in coffee shops without making much of a fuss. Use a pillow or books to elevate the knee if it\u2019s still strained. Once you\u2019ve finished the table \u201cpigeon pose\u201d on both sides, place your foot on top of the table (less coffee shop-friendly) and lean directly forward for 90 seconds (frame 4). Then place your hand on the inside of the knee (frame 5) and extend your arm as you lean away from your leg (frame 6) for 90 seconds. The foot on the table will naturally roll to its outer edge. Repeat on the opposite side. Page 450 3. REPOSITIONING THE PELVIS This is designed to put the head of the femur (thigh bone) in the back of the hip capsule. Extended periods of time in the seated position can move this ball into the front of the socket, causing all sorts of mechanical mayhem and pain. Get on all fours, knees under the hips, and remove all weight from one knee for 90 seconds to two minutes. Next, shift your weight about 4 to the outside of your support knee (frame 2) and rotate the foot in slightly as shown. In frame 2, no weight is on the left leg. Hold again for 90 seconds to two minutes. Repeat on the opposite side. 4. PRE-WORKOUT (WEIGHTS AND OTHERWISE) GLUTE ACTIVATION Start with ten repetitions of the double-leg glute activation seen in \u201cPerfect Posterior.\u201d Be sure your feet are approximately 12\u2033 forward of your glutes, and make a note of how high you\u2019re able to lift your hips. Then perform 15 repetitions of the single-leg variation (shown below)"

    "text": "on each side, pausing for one second at the top of each rep. It\u2019s important to hold your non-support thigh as close to your chest as possible with laced fingers, while pushing hard into your hands with your shin. This non-lifting leg should be Page 451 under a hard isometric (non-moving) contraction for the entire set. Be sure to keep the toes of the support foot up in the air, and drive from the heels. Once finished, test the double-leg lift again. There should be a clear gain in hip height. If not, repeat the single-leg variety but contract harder at the top of the movement. 5. STRENGTHENING THE FEET AND ANKLES Jog barefoot on grass for 30 minutes, three times per week. This is the advice of Gerard Hartmann PhD, an Irish PT trusted by many of the world\u2019s top distance runners, including Haile Gebrselassie, who\u2019s broken 27 world records. 20 Legendary Stanford running coach Vin Lananna, who has produced five NCAA team championships in track and cross country, also has his runners perform a portion of their workouts barefoot on the track\u2019s infield. But how do you run properly in the first place? That\u2019s where the Russian doctor comes in. Becoming Biomechanically Efficient Technique (Form and Tempo) Motion is created by the destruction of balance. \u2014Leonardo da Vinci There is a right way to run. That, at least, is the contention of not only Brian MacKenzie, but also seven- time Western States champion and three-time \u201cUltramarathoner of the Year\u201d Scott Jurek. For Brian, the right way is one way: Pose . Page 452 Nicolas S. Romanov PhD, creator of the Pose Method, was born in 1951 in the unforgiving climes of Siberia. It makes sense on some level that he would become Internet-famous in 2005 for running on ice. 21 How the hell can you run on ice? According to Romanov, by applying the same principles you should use on dry ground: 1. Use gravity (via forward lean) for forward motion instead of push-off and muscular effort. 2. Land on the balls of the feet and aim to have the feet land under your center of gravity instead of in front of you. 3. Never fully straighten your legs. Keep a slight bend in your legs at all times to prevent push-off. 4. Pull each foot off the ground and towards your buttocks (rather than pushing off) using the hamstrings as soon as it passes under your center of gravity. 5. Maintain at least a 180 step per minute rate, which means at least 90 steps per minute with each leg. This will use muscle elasticity to your advantage. Michael Johnson, who held the 200-meter world record for an astonishing 12 years, and also won four Olympic gold medals at different distances, was known for eschewing a high knee lift in favor of short steps. His per-minute step rate? Around 300. Brian suggests training tempo using a Seiko DM50L Metronome, and I found it easiest to use 90 beats per minute for one leg and count when that heel was highest (near the buttocks) as opposed to tapping the ground. RUNNING BY THE NUMBERS: USING VIDEO TO CAPTURE THREE SNAPSHOTS Brian explains running as a four-step process: lean, fall, catch, and pull. Forget pushing off: \u201cThe support phase , the foot hitting the ground, should be thought of as catching you from falling, not a push.\u201d He videotapes all trainees at 30 frames per second with a Casio High-Speed Exilim EX-FC100 camera. He believes, as do I, that you can learn more in one hour of video analysis than you can in a year of self-correction without video. Looking at my third 400-meter repeat to get an accurate picture of semi- fatigued form, Brian reviewed the following numbers: Page 453 1. Frames from ground contact to under General Center of Mass (GCM) 2. Frames on the ground 3. Frames in the air The \u201c Figure 4 \u201d or \u201c Fig. 4 \u201d indicates the Pose position, in which the bent leg crosses the support leg and looks like a number 4. Bear with me.

Frames on the ground: 3 (goal: less than 3). Frames in the air: 4 (goal: 5). Page 456 In less than 36 hours, based on the metrics used, I improved my running economy 22 100% in the first two phases (3p1.5, 6p3) and improved desirable air time 33%. Over the full two days of the certification, we covered more than six hours of whiteboard mechanics and hundreds of details. In practice, four things helped me most: 1. Focus on at least 90 steps per minute with each leg. Particularly if fatigued, focus on this stride rate, which automatically produces the other characteristics of good running mechanics (landing on the balls of the feet, fast pull, etc.). Scott Jurek reinforced this: \u201cIf you focus on higher stride rate, much of the rest corrects itself.\u201d This, to me, is the crucial insight. Ken Mierke, a world-champion triathlete and exercise physiologist, studied Kenyan runners frame-by-frame and now trains his athletes to mimic this \u201crunning on hot coals\u201d approach of smaller steps and higher cadence. The result? Some of them\u2014like Alan Melvin, who was a Page 457 world-class triathlete to begin with\u2014do the seemingly impossible, as described in the book Born to Run . After five months of training at 180+ beats per minute, Melvin ran four one-mile repeats, and every lap time was better than his previous best in the 400 meters. 2. Lean, but fall like a tree instead of bending at the hips. There should be no sitting back. Think of falling forward from the pelvis rather than from the head. 3. For the pull off the ground (see the first three frames of Trial 3), imagine pulling the heel up to your buttocks at a 45-degree forward angle instead of straight up off the ground. This visualization is what allowed me to go from Trial 2 to Trial 3 in two hours. If I thought of pulling the leg straight up off the ground, I subconsciously leaned less, which was self-defeating. Lean at an angle, and envision pulling the heel up at an angle. 4. Use minimal arm movement and consider keeping your wrists near your nipples the entire time. During the initial 100-meter repeats, I purposefully ran directly behind the best ultra-distance runner in our group, matching his tempo and form. He ran with the shortest, most contained arm movements of all. I noticed it was infinitely easier to maintain a high stride rate when mimicking this. Reflecting afterward, it made perfect sense: we are contra-lateral in motion. If one leg moves forward, the opposite arm must move backward, which means you have to maintain the same \u201cstride\u201d rate with both the arms and legs. If your arm movements are too large, your lower-body stride rate has to drop to match them. Solution: bend the arms at least 90 degrees and use small movements. The Pose method isn\u2019t all rainbows and kittens. It\u2019s very useful, but it doesn\u2019t, despite confusing claims, rewrite physics. It\u2019s hard to make forces disappear. The Pose marketing machine points to one particular study as evidence of the method\u2019s ability to reduce landing forces on the knee: \u201cReduced eccentric loading of the knee with the pose running method,\u201d published in 2004. This isn\u2019t the problem. The problem is that they fail to point out another finding in the study: two weeks with the Pose method also increased the eccentric work of the ankles. This, in theory, increases risk of Achilles tendon Page 458 injuries and calf muscle problems. Ross Tucker PhD, a friend and Pose Level I certified instructor who was involved with this study, helped supervise an attempted follow-up study. Runners were split into supervised and unsupervised groups, and the"

The study couldn\u2019t be finished because almost every runner in the unobserved group (all of whom had been trained in the Pose method) and about half of the supervised runners (who\u2019d been trained by Romanov himself) developed Achilles tendon and calf muscle problems. In an e-mail to me, Ross concluded: \u201cIn some, the technique might stick and work. But in many others, the technique will stick and destroy their calves, ankles, and tendons.\u201d The moral of the story? Take it slow. Make changing your running a gradual process and stop if it hurts. Pose has devotees with religious fanaticism for a reason: it can work spectacularly well. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a cure-all. For some, the drills will help more than strict adherence to the gospel while running. For others, like me, the focus on increased stride rate will make the exposure to Pose extremely valuable, even if the other \u201crules\u201d aren\u2019t followed to the letter. Find your own path.

Page 460 ULTRAENDURANCE II Going from 5K to 50K in 12 Weeks\u2014Phase II We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves.\u2026 The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom. No one can say, \u201cYou must not run faster than this, or jump higher than that.\u201d The human spirit is indomitable. \u2014Sir Roger Bannister, first runner to break the 4-minute mile T o get to 50K in 12 weeks, you first need to understand some normal limitations of the human body. Only then can you overcome them. The liver and muscles can only store 1,800\u20132,200 calories of carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. In simple terms, if your running becomes an anaerobic process (literally, without oxygen) you have to pull from these limited stores. Remember what happened to Brian\u2019s 43-year old female runner at the outset of training? She \u201chad no gears\u201d because she became anaerobic as soon as she attempted to increase her per-mile speed. Even if you refuel 200\u2013600 calories per hour, all the stomach can handle, it\u2019s likely you will run out of glycogen before the finish line of an ultramarathon. This is called \u201cbonking\u201d and usually means game over. Force feeding during the race is one option, but it pays to flip another switch. One pound of fat, used during long-state aerobic exercise, contains roughly 4,000 food calories, the same energy density as gasoline. Even if you\u2019re a lean 5% bodyfat at 150 pounds, your available 7.5 pounds of fat can keep you humming for several hundred miles. The trick is, of course, that you have to remain aerobic at higher speeds, which is the fundamental goal of all of Brian\u2019s training. Incredibly, some of his athletes are able to remain aerobic throughout eight rounds of sprints at a 12% incline with just 10 seconds of rest. His athletes are using a near-endless supply of fat calories, when you or I would be choking on"

    "text": "carb-based fumes. The training used to get them there is predicated on two assumptions: 1. The muscle soreness runners feel after long distances is primarily from a weak Page 461 sodium-potassium pump. Strength training is what improves the sodium- potassium pump, and what allows Brian\u2019s athletes to walk around the day after an ultra instead of lying in bed: \u201cIf I can get a runner\u2019s back squat up, I see their marathon time drop. It\u2019s crazy, but it works.\u201d Maximal strength training will improve endurance recovery. 2. If you can run a decent 10K, you already have a sufficient aerobic base to run a 50K. The training should therefore focus on getting you to move at faster speeds while remaining aerobic. Point 2 is called \u201cmoving the aerobic line.\u201d It sounds more pleasant than it is. Moving Your Aerobic Line Brian produces fast-recovering 100-mile runners on less than 30 miles of total running per week, including the intervals and sprints. His recipe is deceptive in its simplicity: focus on improving all of the energetic pathways, performing no runs over 13.1 miles and seldom doing more than 10K. The lactic acid system is one of several pathways that Brian aims to conquer. According to Brian, becoming \u201ccompetent\u201d in all these systems takes six to eight weeks for a lower-caliber runner: 23 Page 462 In simplest terms, an energetically comprehensive program might take the following form, with at least three hours between A.M . and P.M . workouts: Int = \u201cInterval\u201d training is often in a total that equals 1,600 meters, such as: 8 \u00d7 200 m (90 secs rest between), 4 \u00d7 400m (90 secs rest), or 2 \u00d7 800 m (2\u2013 3 min rest). 24 CF = \u201cCrossFit\u201d (2\u201310 minutes of metabolic conditioning; examples are provided later in my 12-week schedule). TT = \u201cTime Trial,\u201d used to test progress in a distance such as 1 mile, 5K, or 10K. Alternatively, you might use the popular \u201cthree-on-one-off\u201d schedule for CrossFit, making sure to include two to three intervals and one time trial per Page 463 week: If you don\u2019t have a track nearby for measuring distances, use GMaps Pedometer online 25 or a Keson RR112 Roadrunner 1 Measuring Wheel from Home Depot or Amazon. Expect your run times (Time Trials) to worsen in the first three weeks of training. This is normal, and your body will quickly return to baseline and then exceed previous bests. In each interval, hill, or Tabata workout, if you can\u2019t recover to a heart rate of 120 in less than two minutes, the workout is ended. You haven\u2019t recovered and adding more stress would just impede progress. Call it quits if needed and come back stronger the next workout. In the first four weeks, if you are unconditioned, this rest period can be increased to three minutes. 26 In generic terms, the taper \u2014a reduction in volume\u2014the last week prior to competition might look like the chart below. The key to the Tabata sprints in this schedule is maintaining a very high per foot strike rate (110+ per foot). If using a treadmill and unsure of speed, set the per-mile time to 30 seconds less than your average 5K per-mile time. 1. \u201cOn minute\u201d means once you start the count up on your stop watch, you do a set at 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, etc. Rest will depend on how quickly you finish each set. \u201cOn two minutes\u201d would mean sets at 2:00, 4:00, 6:00, etc. 2. For example, if your previous best Tabata was completing 6\u20138 \u201creps\u201d at 10 mph on a 12% incline, use the same incline but lower the speed to 8 or 9 mph. If you\u2019re running on flat ground, just reduce the distance you normally run by 20% (e.g., 100m\u219280m). 12 WEEKS TO 50K Page 464 Here represents the exact 12-week program Brian designed to take me from 5K to 50K. I also wanted to target a 24-minute 5K time, which would (if sustained) approximate a 3:50 marathon. 27 The 12-week program is based on my following stats, which he requested: 400m times, with 90 seconds of rest between: 1:20, 1:30, 1:34, and 1:39.

I asked him to include front squatting if squatting were required. Some additional notes on the three-month program: If there is only one workout prescribed for the day, it is possible to do an A.M . workout in the P.M . or vice versa. Unless indicated otherwise, assume no rest between exercises. \u201cAMRAP\u201d means \u201cas many reps (or rounds) as possible\u201d within a given time.

Instructionals and videos of almost all CrossFit exercises, routines (often named after people, like \u201cCindy\u201d), and unfamiliar exercises can be found at www.fourhourbody.com/crossfit . Common tools include rowing machines, pull-up bars, and barbells. If you ask yourself \u201cwhat the hell is that?\u201d in the schedule, it\u2019s probably a CrossFit exercise. Page 488 FAQ WITH BRIAN What type of shoes should I wear? I suggest the Inov-8 X-Talon 212 or Inov-8 F-Lite 230 for trail running. For asphalt and other hard surfaces, I suggest the Inov-8 F-Lite 220, but the F-Lite 230 can be used as well. What not to use: I\u2019ve seen more problems with Newton shoes than any other. Avoid them. Don\u2019t fall for the barefoot myth, either. There is a misguided belief that you can go barefoot and immediately fix all of your problems. If you have been wearing shoes with heels for years and start barefoot running with no transition, expect problems with your Achilles tendons. One year of stretching might get an additional \u00bc range of motion out of them, so if you remove a \u00bd\u2033 heel and go pound the pavement, you\u2019re asking for major issues. Removing the heel will not automatically fix your form. Most of the grandfathers of barefoot running still run with their hip flexors. Take, for instance, the Copper Canyon Ultramarathon. It\u2019s held in the Mexican backyard of the near-mythical Tarahumara Indians, who are world-famous for running in sandals called huaraches. The soles consist of little more than one layer of old tire rubber. It sounds romantic, but the top three runners in 2010 were all wearing shoes. Running barefoot alone does not make you a better runner. The front of my shins kills me after running. How can I prevent this? Don\u2019t \u201cdorsiflex,\u201d or pull the toes up towards the knees, while running. Just imagine doing 21,600 toe raises on each side while sitting down. That\u2019s what will happen if you run 180 total steps per minute for a 4-hour marathon and dorsiflex the entire time. If this is a habit, pre-fatigue the muscle involved (your tibialis anterior) before training by pushing down on your toes with your hands and dorsiflexing slowly on both sides 30 times. Is there a simple indicator of bad form I can monitor while running? If you hear a loud stomp, which is clear during video analysis, you are overengaging your quads and therefore your hip flexors. Aim to be as quiet as possible. Page 489 If you watch the end of a 10K and listen to the loudness of footfalls, you\u2019ll find that the first finishers are the quietest, then you have louder runners, followed by the loudest runners, followed by the walkers. The better the runner, the quieter they are. What should I do if I get fatigued during intervals and my form starts to fail? If you find your form deteriorating, focus on keeping turn-over (stride rate) high. What type of diet do you follow while in training? The biggest problem in endurance sports is, hands down, nutrition. I\u2019ve seen people finish the 135-mile Badwater Ultra in the top 10 who"

    "text": "had no business being in the top 10. One of my runners PR\u2019d [set a personal record] in nine hours off of nutrition alone. Most runners subsist on drinking Gatorade and eating gels. The high-carb diet is crap. You need to replenish glycogen, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to eat pizza and pasta, or cereal and bread, during training. I follow, and suggest my athletes follow, a Paleolithic or \u201cpaleo\u201d diet, which omits starches, grains, and beans. It consists of lean protein, vegetables, a little fruit, a sh** ton of fat and nothing else. The most critical thing a runner or athlete can do is record three days of food logs, which includes weighing their food. This will give you a clear idea of baseline. Do you take anything in particular post-workout? This time window is a paleo exception. I consume GENr8 Vitargo S2, a carbohydrate supplement, which allows me to replenish glycogen faster than any other product I\u2019ve used. Some athletes can consume 1,100 calories an hour of Vitargo, if needed, versus 200\u2013600 calories of carbs from whole foods. If I\u2019m able to consume Vitargo within ten minutes of my workout, I usually take 70 grams. If more than ten minutes have passed, 35 grams. I\u2019ll also consume Vitargo for the first 3\u20134 hours of a race, after which I move to whole food. FORCED EVOLUTION Brian\u2019s protocol, 12 weeks of murderous intent (but not volume), has worked for nearly everyone who\u2019s done it to the letter. Did it work for me? Enzymes notwithstanding, was I able to create a 50K ultrarunner out of a huffing and puffing mess? Page 490 \u201cIt\u2019s important to train the body to process food during movement, and you should practice this during your longer training runs. Aim to consume one gram of carbohydrate (CHO) per hour, per kilogram body weight. For example, if you weigh 110 lbs. (50 kg), you would aim for 50 grams of CHO per hour.\u2026 Most bananas are approximately 25 g of CHO, so, in this example, you could eat two bananas per hour. But don\u2019t eat all your carbs at once. Consume 25 g, in this bodyweight example, every 20\u201330 minutes and gulp water at the same time. Why gulping? Gulping, and the subsequent pressure in the stomach, is an important trigger for gastric emptying. Sipping doesn\u2019t have the same effect.\u201d Page 491 4:00 A.M ., Daly City, California Dean Karnazes didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d been running. In fact, he wasn\u2019t sure where he was. The tequila was wearing off and he came to three realizations all at once: 1. He had just turned 30, which explained the tequila the night before. Normal. 2. He was not wearing pants and was running in his underwear. Not normal. 3. He felt more alive than he had in 15 years, when he last ran in high school. So he kept going. He later called his wife from a 7-Eleven parking lot in Santa Cruz, 30 miles south of where he\u2019d started: on his porch in San Francisco, grabbing old sneakers he\u2019d used for mowing the lawn. She was a bit confused, especially by the underwear part. Dean, on the other hand, had achieved ultimate lucidity. The corporate life, even with the new Lexus and the perks of indoor servitude, was not for him. Things needed to change. Change they did. From cubicle dweller, he transformed into a mainstream demigod in the world of ultramarathoning. If running 135 miles nonstop in the 120-degree heat of Death Valley 28 weren\u2019t enough, he also decided running 26.2 miles at \u221240\u00b0 around the South Pole would be a challenge. (It was, especially in tennis shoes; he was the only one to spurn snowshoes.) To bring national media attention to childhood obesity and exercise, he then ran 50 marathons in 50 consecutive days in all 50 states. In other words, Dean sees more marathons in a year than most will see in a lifetime. He competes almost every weekend. Here are Dean\u2019s top-5 lists of must-run and must-experience marathons for newbies and pros alike.

These bursts were performed 3x a week for just two weeks. Total on-bike time for the two weeks was a mere 15 minutes. Endurance capacity for this \u201csprint\u201d group almost doubled, from 26 to 51 minutes, and their leg muscles showed a significant 38% increase of our friend citrate synthase (CS), one of the desirable endurance enzymes. The control group, which was active (jogging, cycling, or aerobics) showed no changes. It seemed like a fluke. It had to be repeated, and it was. This time with an even higher bar for evaluation: an 18.6-mile cycling test. The sprint group followed the 30-second burst protocol. The control group performed more traditional moderate-intensity cycling for 60\u201390 minutes at 60% VO2 Max. Both groups worked out 3x a week and were evaluated before and after with an 18.6-mile cycling test. The improvements were almost identical, as were the increases in muscle oxidative capacity.

(Photo courtesy Prof. Stuart McGill PhD and Spine Biomechanics Lab, University of Waterloo, Canada) P avel Tsatsouline was punching me in the ass. It\u2019s not every day that you have a former Soviet Special Forces instructor punch you in the butt cheeks. But it was the second day of Russian Kettlebell Certification (RKC), and we were practicing constant tension, one of several techniques intended to increase strength output. In this case, we spot-checked each other with punches. Pavel, now a U.S. citizen and subject matter expert to the U.S. Secret Service Counter Assault Team, wandered the ranks, contributing jabs where needed. Two hours earlier, Pavel had asked the attendees for someone stuck at a 1-rep maximum in the one-arm overhead press. He then proceeded to take the volunteer from 53 lbs. to 72 lbs. in less than five minutes: a 26% strength increase. Translated into more familiar terms, this would represent a jump in one-repetition max from 106 pounds to 144 pounds in the barbell military press. There were dozens of such demonstrations throughout the weekend, and each Page 501 was intended to reinforce a point: strength is a skill . Not only is strength a skill, but it can be learned quickly. I didn\u2019t realize how quickly until several months later, when Pavel introduced me to a curious sprint coach: Barry Ross. Reducing the Irreducible In 2003, Allyson Felix was a 17-year-old high school student. In the space of 12 months, she broke all of Marion Jones\u2019s high school records in the 200 meters, went on to run the fastest 200 meters in the world, and then became the first high school athlete to go directly into professional track. Her coach was Barry Ross. Ross has spent the last 20 years looking for the most elegant answer to one of the biggest questions in all of sports: how do you make humans as fast as possible? His solution has been to reduce the irreducible, beyond even what I thought possible. As I write this over fried calamari and cioppino at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf in San Francisco (it\u2019s Saturday), I still can\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve gained more than 120 pounds on my maximum deadlift in less than two months, with less than 10 pounds of weight gain. It\u2019s easily the fastest strength increase I\u2019ve ever experienced. In Barry\u2019s world, it\u2019s nothing special. Here is a quick look at three of his athletes that you might find surprising: His best female multi-event athlete has deadlifted 405 pounds at a bodyweight of 132 pounds. (See her photo in this chapter.) His best female distance runner has deadlifted 380 pounds at a bodyweight of 138 pounds. His youngest male lifter, 11 years old, has lifted 225 pounds at a bodyweight of 108 pounds. Nearly all of his athletes, including women, can lift more than twice their bodyweight without wrist straps, and all have gained less than 10% of additional bodyweight to get"

    "text": "there. The kicker: these results were achieved with less than 15 minutes of actual lifting time (time under tension) per week. From Pac 10 titles in shot put, to gold medals in the 4\u00d7100-meter relay, Page 502 Barry\u2019s unusual methods are redefining what is possible. In this chapter, I\u2019ll explain how he does it in sprinting, and how you can do the same in the gym or in your sport. The Effortless Superhuman Protocol The training protocol for Allyson Felix in 2003 consisted of the following, three times per week: 1 . Dynamic stretching before each session (\u201cover-unders,\u201d detailed later). 2 . One of the following, five minutes rest between sets: 1 . Bench press: 1 2\u20133 sets of 2\u20133 reps or 2 . Push-ups: 10\u201312 reps 2 3 . Conventional deadlift to knees, 2\u20133 sets of 2\u20133 reps at 85\u201395% of 1- repetition max (1RM). Bar does NOT go higher than the knee and is dropped from that height rather than returned to the ground by the athlete. Dropping, and therefore avoiding the eccentric lowering portion, is critical for reducing hamstring injuries when also doing sprint training. Time under tension should be less than 10 seconds per set. For deadlift sets: \u2022 Plyometrics are performed immediately after the end of each set (box jumps 3 of various heights \u00d7 4\u20136 reps) \u2022 Take five minutes rest in between sets, with the five-minute countdown starting after plyometrics 4 . Core exercise, 3\u20135 sets of 3\u20135 reps (isometric holds) 5 . Static stretching The workout Allyson used was predicated on research that suggested greater ground force support (applying force to the ground at landing), rather than shorter leg swing times, 4 enabled runners to reach faster top speeds. The amount of support force needed to increase speed by one meter per second is equal to one-tenth the bodyweight. Skeletal muscle is a very effective generator of force. One kilogram can produce enough force to support 44 kilograms of mass. Previously, coaches believed that a reduction in fuel supply to the muscle was Page 503 the cause of speed drops. Research has since shown that the real cause of speed loss is the inability of the fibers to supply sufficient tension. If you need more tension, you need more strength. An elite athlete will impact the ground with approximately two times their mass while receiving an equal amount of push back from the ground. Mass- specific support force\u2014the force muscles generate in response to impact\u2014can exceed five times the bodyweight of the elite athlete and is delivered to the ground in approximately 0.05 seconds. Keep in mind that this is on one leg at a time. All other things equal, the stronger runner will win. Page 504 The following sequence of photographs, courtesy of Mike Lambert, editor of Powerlifting USA magazine, shows the incredible Lamar Gant. Lamar, a member of the International Powerlifting Federation Hall of Fame, was the first person to deadlift five times his bodyweight in competition: 661 pounds (300 kilograms) at a bodyweight of 132 pounds (60 kilograms). Here\u2019s how he does it: Barry has his athletes drop the weight at the top of the kneecaps (fourth photo in the series) to avoid hamstring injuries, which is also illustrated in the below pictures: Page 505 His athletes are taught to avoid straightening the legs prematurely and to also maintain a perfectly straight back, 5 as if pinching a wallet between their shoulder blades. This strength training protocol allows running immediately after strength training, 6 eliminating the need for a time-consuming split training. No lifts are done to failure. Besides \u201cover-unders\u201d performed prior to the first exercise, there are no warm-ups in the workout. 7 Over-unders are executed as follows: Using a power rack or hurdles, set one pin/hurdle to approximately 30\u201332 inches and the other at waist height. Squat low enough to step sideways under the lower pin/hurdle, then immediately step over the higher one. 8 That is one repetition. Do not use your hands or put them on your legs. Repeat six to"

    "text": "seven times. Then move directly into work sets. Barry has his athletes lift the heaviest load of an exercise first, followed by sets with lighter loads, if needed. To estimate your 1-rep max (1RM) in a given exercise, just multiply your 5-rep max weight x 1.2. The Basic Rule: Less Than 10 Seconds As a general guideline, we don\u2019t want time under tension for exercise sets to exceed 10 seconds, as we want to minimize lactic acid production. Though lactic acid (often felt as muscle \u201cburn\u201d) can be helpful in some circumstances, it can also delay recovery. In cases where athletes need to hit benchmarks in short periods of time, Barry wants to retain their ability to do the same workout for five straight days. This approach is not limited to sprinting. 9 One nonrunner example is Skyler McKnight, who needed to bench 225 Page 506 pounds 20 times to be a starter for the San Jose State football team. There was just one problem: he could only complete three reps and had three weeks until the test. He had only 15 workout days to make the mark. Five days a week, he did five sets of two repetitions with five minutes\u2019 rest between sets. He increased the weight but did not increase the repetition range. On test day, he completed 18 reps and, yes, the coach was shocked enough to give him a starting position. Consider another set of results from Greg Almon, strength consultant to the Chinese national speed skating team: Dear Barry, I would just like to give you an update as to how my skaters have performed this year from switching to a Deadlift based protocol; The Chinese women\u2019s team has won more than 10 gold medals in the sprint categories (500, 1000m), as well as 10 more silver and bronze combined. We now have 5 skaters that skate 44 seconds or better in the 500m and broke the world record in the last competition. It was tough to convince the coach to switch, but after several days of conversation, she agreed to try it. Our women skaters have increased their deadlift by an average of 115 pounds over the last 3.5 months and the results speak for themselves.\u2026 Thanks again, Greg The New and Improved Trinity What has Barry refined and improved since Allyson\u2019s record-breaking performances in 2003? Based on the latest research, he has narrowed his sprint-specific program to three simple and sequential training goals: 1. Competition conditioning 2. Maximal strength 3. Maximal speed Page 507 For each, Barry relies on the core philosophy of coach Henk Kraaijenhof: \u201cDo as little as needed, not as much as possible.\u201d All three objectives require (that is, demand) less workload than commonly thought necessary. COMPETITION CONDITIONING Training for the first goal, conditioning, draws heavily from a study titled \u201cEnergetics of High-Speed Running: Integrating Classical Theory and Contemporary Observations,\u201d first published in 2004. This study provides the ASR speed algorithm, a mathematical formula patented by Rice University that claims to predict running times for any individual (not just a trained athlete but any individual) for distances ranging from a few meters up to a mile. Incredibly, it\u2019s proven more than 97% accurate for every runner Barry has tested. The algorithm also shows the level of a runner\u2019s condition. The minimum baseline conditioning for athletes engaged in runs of less than a mile is approximately 4.2 meters per second. This equates to a 100- meter run time of no more than 23.8 seconds. How do you get athletes to this baseline? Believe it or not, by walking. The prescription is simple: walk as fast as possible for 15 minutes, three sessions per week. The walk is seven and a half minutes out and the same time back. This doesn\u2019t sound difficult, and it isn\u2019t \u2026 at first. The challenge is that the athlete must walk further out at each session and still return in the same seven and a half minutes. \u201cWalk as fast as possible\u201d means that the athlete should strongly and persistently want to jog. He or she is experiencing extreme inefficiency in"

    "text": "locomotion, and that\u2019s the point. If you don\u2019t have enough flat ground (a track is ideal) to walk seven and a half minutes straight out and back, just use a set distance (five blocks, for example) and match the number of lengths in the second seven and a half minutes. After four weeks of this timed walking (three sessions of 15 minutes per week) the athlete has accomplished the first goal: reaching baseline conditioning for competition. It seems impossible, but reserve judgment until you see some of their results, described later in this chapter. MAXIMAL STRENGTH Next, Barry gets his athletes strong. Really, really strong. His current protocol is similar to what Allyson used in 2003, but the exercises Page 508 have been further refined and limited. Notice that \u201c2\u20133 sets of 2\u20133\u201d has been replaced with \u201c1 set of 2\u20133 @ 95% 1RM, followed by 1 set of 5 @ 85% 1RM\u201d for both the bench press and deadlift. Reminder: take five-minute rest periods between sets, and the countdown starts after completion of plyometrics. The following general workout template would be performed three times per week for most athletes (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday): 1. Dynamic stretch before each session: over-and-unders \u00d7 6\u20137 reps, no more than 5 minutes. No static stretching. 2. One of the following at each session (time under tension should be less than 15 seconds per set): Bench press: 1 set of 2\u20133 @ 95% 1RM, followed by 1 set of 5 @ 85% 1RM or Push-ups: 10\u201312 reps (same as in earlier program) If you choose bench press and if equipment permits, perform plyometrics (four to five reps) immediately after bench-press sets. Place two 6\u201312-inch-high boxes just outside of shoulder width. From the fully lowered position between the boxes (chest on the floor), jump up onto the boxes by fully extending your arms as quickly as possible, extend your arms fully Page 509 again on top of the boxes, then drop back down inside the boxes into the fully down position. Just as with box jumps, it is critical to keep ground contact as short as possible. If the plyometrics hurt your shoulders (as they did mine) or are too inconvenient, the program still works well without them. 3. Deadlift, 10 1 set of 2\u20133 @ 95% 1RM, followed by 1 set of 5 @ 85% 1RM. Same rules as before: lift to the knees and then drop. If you\u2019re not practicing high-speed running, lowering is fine. Plyometrics are performed within one minute after each set of deadlifts: box jumps of varying heights, jumping rope, or even a few short, fast 10-meter runs if space is available. First choice is two to four 10\u201315-meter sprints. This provides at least two times bodyweight borne by each leg upon impact. Second choice is five to seven 12\u201318-inch box jumps. 4. Core exercise: the Torture Twist, 3\u20135 sets of 3\u20135 reps (30 seconds between sets). For the core, Barry now only uses one exercise: the Torture Twist. Every single trainee who uses it hates it. To perform the Torture Twist, set yourself perpendicular on a bench so that you look like a cross from above. Hold your feet under a pole in a power rack or, worst case, under another bench. 11 Does this look like a bulky powerlifter? No, it looks like a normal high school girl. Normal, except that she\u2019s 132 pounds and can deadlift 405 pounds! Holy emasculation, Batman! Remain parallel to the ground for each set and come up to sitting position for 30 seconds of rest between sets. Start with three sets \u00d7 three reps of three seconds on each side. Your first session would look like the following: Page 510 SET 1 Turn fully to the right side and hold for three seconds. Turn to the left side and hold for three seconds. Repeat two more times for a total of 3x three-second holds per side . Sit up and rest 30 seconds. Repeat for two more sets. Progression: In future workouts, gradually increase up to five sets of three- second holds, then increase time, one second at a time, up to a maximum of 15- second holds for five sets (each set = 3 holds per side).

    "text": "workout. Total workout time, including rest: less than 60 minutes. Total time under tension per workout: less than 5 minutes. Feeling at workout conclusion: exhilarated instead of exhausted. Barry suggests the sumo deadlift instead of the conventional deadlift whenever possible. The pull distance is shorter and the lower-back position is safer. The following sequence of photographs, also courtesy of Mike Lambert from Powerlifting USA , show the incredible Mike Bridges, who was considered by many to be the best pound-for-pound powerlifter in the world during his prime. He dominated three different weight classes, and even now, in his fifties, he regularly deadlifts more than 600 pounds. Keep in mind that Barry\u2019s athletes drop the weight when the bar reaches the top of the kneecaps (here the fourth photo). Notice that, like Lamar, Mike is looking up at almost exactly 45 degrees the entire time, until completion. Page 511 MAXIMAL SPEED Finally, once Barry\u2019s athletes are strong, he makes them faster. If you have no interest in running, you can skip this section and just read the sidebars. But, if nothing else, the competition anecdote at the end is fun to read. Now back to our story \u2026 Each athlete runs two time trials to start. The short trial (T1) is a \u201cfly-in\u201d 20- meter run and the long trial (T2) is a run of 300 meters. For T1, the athlete runs a 40-meter dash, but only the second 20 meters are timed. For T2, the athlete has a five-meter run up to the line, and then a timed 300 meters. In both cases, the runners should already be close to top speed when they cross the start line. Once he has these two times, Barry plugs the numbers into the ASR algorithm, which gives him a precise distance and time to run for each runner. This distance/time will form the basis for their speed workout. For events of 400 meters or less, Barry\u2019s athletes do no training runs longer than 70 meters. The determined \u201cX distance performed under time Y\u201d can be thought of as Page 512 one \u201crepetition,\u201d and reps are performed until the runner cannot complete the distance in the time allotted, or cannot complete 10 repetitions under a predetermined total time (a timed \u201cset\u201d of 10 repetitions). Exceeding time in either case marks the end of the workout. Here is a real-world example from a runner named Scott: 20-meter fly-in 1.88 seconds 300-meter fly-in 36.00 seconds The workout distances are then randomized between 15 meters and 55 meters, such as 55 meters < 5.57 seconds. This means that Scott\u2019s workout is a series of 10 runs of 55 meters that must not exceed 5.57 seconds each. Four-minute rests are taken in between runs. If Scott does not run under 5.57 in his first attempt, he is given one more opportunity to make it on a second run. If he exceeds his time on this second run, or any \u201crep\u201d before his 10th, his workout is finished for that day. This is a sharp contrast to conventional methods. Sprint coaches usually tell their runners to run \u201crepeats\u201d at a particular distance and at a particular speed. A typical workout prescription might be \u201c10 \u00d7 100-meter runs at 80% of top speed.\u201d Unfortunately, no one knows when he or she is running at 80%, or any other percent for that matter. Coaches also prescribe so-called \u201cover-distance\u201d runs to improve \u201cspeed endurance.\u201d This is another added stress that Barry does not incorporate. But how does his approach measure up in competition? Keep in mind that his athletes\u2019 average repeat running distance is under 40 meters, and that he\u2019s completely eliminated training runs of over 70 meters for events of 400 meters or less. This is sacrilege in many corners of the track and field world. Despite this minimalism\u2014or more accurately, because of it\u2014the results speak for themselves. One of his high school female athletes cut two seconds off her 400 meter, one and a half seconds off her 300 intermediate hurdles (IM), and dropped her 100 meter from 13.35 to 12.75 seconds. Though it\u2019s hard for nonsprinters to appreciate, dropping"

    "text": "from 13.35 to 12.75 is a huge improvement for such a short anaerobic event, where milliseconds matter. Her average repeat distance (her \u201crep\u201d distance) was a mere 33 meters, and she is by no means a novice. She had been running for six years. Page 513 Her pre-track season conditioning was just 15 minutes of fast walking three days per week. Her goal was to increase the distance covered (but never the time) each session. She, her dad, and her team coach doubted she\u2019d ever be able to run a competitive 400-meter or 300-meter hurdle. The low volume almost drove her to panic. The outcome: the first meet of the year, she beat two runners in the 300 hurdles she had not bested in the previous two track seasons. After watching her against the competition, her track coach told her dad, \u201cNever again will I make my sprinters practice over 70 meters!\u201d She also weighs 119 pounds and deadlifts 340 pounds. The paradigm is shifting and the writing is on the wall: working smarter beats working longer, whether in the weight room or on the track. by Pavel Tsatsouline Athletes often miss the point of strength training. Some confuse it with conditioning. Others confuse themselves with powerlifters. The barbell is not there to make you a better man (or woman) by testing your mettle. That is what the court, the field, or the mat is for. The barbell is there to give you a strength advantage over an opponent of equal skill. Strength training cannot interfere with the practice of your sport. This is the point\u2014the most important point\u2014that many strength and conditioning coaches somehow miss. The crucial principle is to lift heavy but not hard . This is where the \u201crule of 10 reps\u201d can be applied: 1. Use two to three \u201cglobal\u201d compound exercises (e.g., the deadlift and the bench press). 2. Lift three times a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). 12 Do your conditioning and supplementary work on separate days, practice your sport skills six days a week, and take one day off completely. 3. Focus on sets of two or three reps. Two reps is the most preferred rep choice of the Russian National Weight Lifting Team. 4. In all cases, complete approximately 10 reps per lift per workout (e.g., three Page 514 sets of three, five sets of two, etc.). 5. Never train to failure, and always leave at least one to two reps \u201cin the bank.\u201d 6. Rest for five minutes between sets. 7. Finish your workout feeling stronger than when you started. The goal is to build as much strength as possible while staying as fresh as possible for your sport. When I worked with Maria Sharapova, I had her do a few singles, doubles, and triples of pull-ups, pistols, 13 hard push-ups, Janda sit-ups, and nothing else. The future Wimbledon star had plenty of conditioning from her daily tennis practice, and the last thing she needed was fatigue and injuries from her strength regimen. But what about less frequent training? Less frequent training than Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (i.e., once a week) is not ideal for an athlete, even if it builds strength and consumes less time. U.S. powerlifting records in the 1980s and 1990s leave no doubt that you can achieve a world-class squat by trashing yourself once a week. But you will not walk well afterward. Every time you lift, you will get as sore as a newbie. This isn\u2019t a big deal for a powerlifter, but it\u2019s very bad news for a boxer or someone who needs to train in the subsequent 48 hours. Can more volume build strength? Of course. The iconic Smolov squat cycle, a 13-week nightmare, calls for a gruesome 136 reps per week during the first month! The cycle delivers beyond anyone\u2019s wildest dreams. One man I knew added 105 pounds to his squat in 13 weeks of Smolov and peaked in the mid-600s, drug-free. His gains are not atypical. But it takes its toll. You will be so sore and exhausted that the only \u201csport\u201d you could practice at the same time is chess. The Smolov is a specialized program for an athlete who does not have any skills to practice outside of"

    "text": "the gym. An exception would be an athlete who must gain a lot of muscle mass in the off-season, such as a football lineman. Canadian track coach Charlie Francis\u2019s approach to strength training the infamous sprinter Ben Johnson is very illuminating. The sprinter stayed with low reps and low volume, e.g., to 600\u00d72/6 14 (sets/reps) in the below parallel box squat and 385\u00d73/2 in the bench press. The 173-pound Johnson eventually benched over 400 pounds, and Francis was convinced he was good for 440. But \u2014pay attention!\u2014to avoid injury, the sharp coach never maxed his athlete. This Page 515 obviously did not prevent Johnson from breaking his personal records. Without maxing. Francis\u2019s in-season strength training was in line with the Russian school. Nikolay Ozolin, one of the founding fathers of Soviet sport science, recommends cutting back in-season lifting volume to 2/3 of off-season lifting volume without reducing weight. Francis downshifted Johnson from two sets of six with 600 in the squat to two sets of doubles or triples, a 1/2 to 2/3 reduction of the already low volume. This reduction allowed Johnson to get extra fresh for the season without losing his strength. Francis quipped that \u201cBen was never far from strength and speed.\u201d Indeed, he was not pushing as hard, but he was still handling 600 pounds. Francis did the opposite of most coaches: \u201cNinety percent of my time is spent holding athletes back to prevent overtraining, and only 10 percent is spent motivating them to do more work.\u201d 2\u20133 is a great rep range to emphasize throughout an athlete\u2019s program. 4\u20135 is where neural training and muscle-building meet, which means you could end up with some hypertrophy. This is out of the question in weight-class-based sports like boxing. Steve Baccari, strength coach extraordinaire to top fighters like the UFC\u2019s Joe Lauzon, agrees with the heavy but not hard approach: \u201cIn my opinion, \u2018easy\u2019 strength training is the only productive way a competitive fighter can strength train.\u2026 But most people think if you don\u2019t break a sweat, it must not work. This used to bother me a lot, but not anymore, because I think it is one reason why my fighters win so much.\u201d Concludes Baccari: \u201cStrength training is like putting the money in the bank to take it out on the fight day.\u201d Save the fatigue for your sport. Page 516 If you\u2019re looking for an abdominal exercise well-suited to power development without bulk, look no further than the Janda sit-up. Pavel has been able to register contractions in excess of 175% MVC (maximal voluntary isometric contraction) for the rectus abdominis at Dr. Stuart McGill\u2019s laboratory performing the Janda sit-up with a device called, appropriately enough, the Ab Pavelizer. Some scientists theorize that the downward contraction of the hamstrings forces the hip flexors to relax, which largely prevents them from helping with the movement. Ergo, more than 100% MVC of the remaining workhorse: the rectus abdominis. To perform the Janda sit-up without any equipment, do the following: 1. \u2022 Loop a towel around your calves and have a training partner pull on it lightly at a 45-degree upward angle, trying to lift your feet. Or, less ideal but practical for solo use: \u2022 Wrap a resistance band around the knob of an open door and wrap the band around your calves, ensuring a downward 45-degree angle. Then: 2. \u2022 Bring your tailbone and your navel together, and slowly sit up without allowing your feet to lift up or to slide toward you. Page 517 It\u2019s much harder than it looks: even if you can do 50 normal sit-ups, don\u2019t be surprised if you can\u2019t complete a single proper Janda sit-up in the beginning. In this case, start with lowering from the top position (negatives) only. The \u201crule of 10 reps\u201d can be applied here. For instance, you might start with five sets of two (5 \u00d7 2) negatives and then progress through the following rep schemes as you get stronger: 2323 (\u201c2323\u201d means four sets total: 2 reps, 3 reps, 2 reps, and 3 reps), then 343, then 235,"

    "text": "and then 2 \u00d7 5. Once you can do these negatives under control, you can start doing full reps using the same progression or another \u201crule of 10\u201d combination. Remember to maintain a continual speed for negatives: don\u2019t stay in one spot forever and then free fall to the floor. Hold on to something with your hands if necessary, such as a table leg or a resistance band around a door knob. Page 518 \u201cChronobiology\u201d is the science of investigating time-dependent changes in physiology. Muscle strength and short-term power output peak in the early evening (4:00\u2013 6:00 P.M. ), which coincides with daily maximum body temperature. 15 Pain tolerance, at least for arthritis and fibromyalgia, is also highest between 4:00 and 5:00 P.M . But 4:00\u20136:00 P.M. workouts never produced the best results for me. I believe this is because the ideal window depends on circadian rhythm and therefore wake time. These variables are almost never accounted for in studies. If we assume an average wake time of 8:00 A.M. for most subjects who have work or classes beginning at 9:00 A.M. , and if peak power output and pain tolerance is between 4:00 and 6:00 P.M. in their studies, this corresponds to 8\u201310 hours after waking. I am a night owl, and my average wake time is 11:00 A.M. Using this average, 16 8\u201310 hours after waking would put my ideal window between 7:00 and 9:00 P.M. That\u2019s how I arrived at an optimal workout time of 7:00 to 9:00 P.M. , which has allowed me to add two to three repetitions to most exercises when using less than 85% of a one-repetition maximum (usually a set of six reps or more). This doesn\u2019t mean you have to train at night, but you should keep training times consistent so you can accurately gauge progress. TOOLS AND TRICKS Over-unders Dynamic Warm-Up ( www.fourhourbody.com/over-under ) This is a demo of the hip mobility movements using a single bar. Focus on the side hurdle (0:30) and under-the-hurdle side squat (1:30), which, when alternated, constitute the over-unders Barry recommends as a dynamic warm-up. Underground Secrets to Faster Running by Barry Ross ( www.fourhourbody.com/underground ) Allyson Felix used this strength training system right before she ran the fastest 200 meters in the world back in 2003. Page 519 \u201cHigh-Speed Running Performance: A New Approach to Assessment and Prediction\u201d by Matthew W. Bundle, Reed W. Hoyt, and Peter G. Weyand ( www.fourhourbody.com/hsrp ) This is the original study from Rice University that developed the ASR speed algorithm. In Barry Ross\u2019s words, \u201cWhat they found was the Holy Grail to faster running speed.\u201d ASRspeed ( www.fourhourbody.com/asr ) The actual sprinting program that Barry Ross discussed in this chapter. Any athlete who plays a sport requiring sudden bursts of forward speed (sprints, basketball, baseball, football, soccer, etc.) can benefit tremendously by using this program. It will largely eliminate the need for hill runs, sled towing, parachutes, and all the other tricks and toys people use to get faster. \u201cHow to Add 100 Pounds to Your Squat in 13 Weeks with the Smolov Cycle\u201d ( www.fourhourbody.com/smolov ) The Smolov Cycle is a Russian strength training routine designed by Master of Sports S. Y. Smolov. This cycle, though complex and very brutal, can easily add 60\u2013100 pounds to your squat. You can also download an Excel spreadsheet that\u2019s designed to help you keep track of your progress during the Smolov program ( www.fourhourbody.com/smolov-excel ). Fat Gripz ( www.fourhourbody.com/fatgripz ) Thick-bar training increases grip strength fast. The problem is that thick bars cost $200 or more. The solution is Fat Gripz, each the size of a Red Bull can (easy for travel), which slide onto normal bars in ten seconds. Take a week after every four weeks of heavy training to use Fat Gripz with lighter weights (I do stiff-legged deadlifts). Trust me, it will be harder than you think. Page 520 End of Chapter Notes 1.

Doing competition- standard lifts is of no interest, as his athletes are training for sports performance, not powerlifting competition. 2. Once athletes can complete 12 standard push-ups, Barry has them elevate their legs to increase resistance. The legs aren\u2019t elevated above 50 degrees (relative to the floor) because it would involve the shoulders more than the pectorals. For pure runners, the exercise is for general pectoral work, rather than for the purpose of the sport. The pectorals are just about the only muscle group not stimulated by the deadlift, which follows. 3. The idea is to keep ground contact as short as possible on each landing, six landings maximum. In Barry\u2019s training sessions, these jumps are sometimes onto a box, sometimes over a box, and standing triple jump or broad jump can also be substituted. Personally, to keep it simple, I used a standard flat bench and tapped both feet on the top (rather than landing) before returning to the ground, repeating six times. 4. Also referred to as \u201cturnover.\u201d 5. Lamar appears to be slightly rounding his back in his photos, but it\u2019s his thoracic (upper back) spine and not his lumbar (lower back) that\u2019s rounded. This upper rounding is common in the conventional deadlift when handling world-class poundages. Mere mortals should maintain a flat back until deadlifting well more than two times bodyweight. 6. Note that the opposite is not true. Lifting before running is fine, but running before lifting is asking for injuries. 7. This is one place where I diverged from instructions and performed warm-up sets of 1\u20132 reps leading up to my heaviest work weight. If I have an unidentified injury, I\u2019d prefer it to blow out with 100 pounds instead of 400. This is a topic that Barry and I agree to disagree on. 8. This format wasn\u2019t practical at my closest gym, which is crowded and only has one rack. I opted instead to simply step sideways over a bench with knees as high as possible, which I followed with an immediate parallel squat and sidestep that increased in width with each repetition. The lateral \u201cunders\u201d are particularly important for increasing hip mobility before heavy \u201csumo\u201d style deadlifts, which both Barry and Pavel recommend when possible. 9. It\u2019s not limited to 15\u201330-year-olds either. Take a look at Professor Arthur DeVany and his version of alactic training. Art, a professor emeritus of the University of California Irvine in economics and mathematical behavioral sciences, is 72 years young, 6\u20321\u2033, and 205 pounds at 8% bodyfat. 10. Felix used the conventional stance with her legs inside her arms, but Barry suggests sumo-style for those who can perform it. 11. This was also inconvenient to set up at my gym, so I either used a decline bench press bench, where I could hook in my feet with bent legs; or I simply sat on a BOSU ball at home with my feet hooked under the couch (be sure to weigh down the couch; I used a 24kg kettlebell). 12. If unable to recover, the deadlift can be reduced to Monday and Friday. 13. One-legged squats with the unused leg extended straight in front of you. 14. Note from Tim: Coincidentally, I\u2019ve made my greatest strength gains outside of the deadlift using two work sets of six, two exercises per workout. 15. Heart rate\u2013based tests of work capacity appear to peak in the morning because the heart rate responses to exercise are minimal at this time of day. 16. It\u2019s important to use an average, not just the wake time on a scheduled workout day.

    "text": "Squat 405? Play on ESPN? If not, don\u2019t touch the iPod! There was some distance to go before I benched 315. 17 I would have to wait to put Disco Duck on the loudspeakers. DeFranco\u2019s boys, on the other hand, had no problem with 315. His cadre of beasts included freaks of nature like Rich Demers, who could bench-press 215 pounds for 39 reps. That impressed me. It impressed me, but it didn\u2019t stun me. Stunning was Joe Ceklovsky, who has bench-pressed 600 pounds in competition at 148 pounds bodyweight. Stunning was Scot Mendelson, who has bench-pressed 1,031 pounds in competition at 275 pounds bodyweight. To put 1,031 in perspective, imagine loading a standard gym barbell with 45- pound plates until no more can fit. That is a measly 885 pounds. Scot has to use 100-pound plates, and the tempered-steel bar literally bends around his hands. He wears a mouth guard so he doesn\u2019t shatter his teeth with jaw tension, and his vision gets pulled out horizontally when the bar pauses at his chest. These are unusual people. But that\u2019s a compliment. You can learn a lot from the extremes. Background on the Bench: My Achille\u2019s Heel Page 522 The bench press has always been my weakest exercise. Few sports require much of the chest, and my principal sport of wrestling practically made a point of neglecting it. Even on a steady diet of doubles (sets of two) on Barry\u2019s program, my maximum bench wouldn\u2019t budge. In this, I was an exception. So I called one of the sages of powerlifting to settle the issue. Marty Gallagher stays out of the limelight, but has long been in the record books. He has coached some of the most legendary powerlifters of all time, including Ed Coan, Kirk Karwoski, Doug Furness, Mike Hall, and Dan Austin. Coan alone set more than 70 world records. Kirk \u201cCaptain Kirk\u201d Karwoski increased the International Powerlifting Federation (IPF) world record for the squat an astonishing 100 pounds during his reign, from 903 to 1,003 pounds, and this world record still stands 16 years later. Marty is also a three-time master powerlifting world champion and six-time master national powerlifting champion, not to mention that he coached the U.S. powerlifting squad to the IPF world team title in 1991. Suffice to say, he understands the subtleties of the iron game. In his words, what follows was his pound-by-pound, workout-by-workout presciption for me, or anyone who wants to add 100 pounds to their current max in six months. Enter Marty Gallagher Is it possible for a regular fellow with a 200-pound bench press to add 100 pounds to his bench press in six months? The answer is that, while improbable, it is not impossible. It requires eating the elephant one bite at a time. There are three requirements: Requirement #1: A periodized tactical game plan. Periodization is another word for progressive resistance preplanning. Elite powerlifters, Olympic weight lifters, and professional athletes use periodization to stair- step their way upward to ever greater strength levels over a specified time period, usually 12\u201316 weeks. By expropriating a periodization strategy and applying it to the bench press, the impossible becomes plausible. Toward the end of his career, Kirk Karwoski never missed a rep in any lift over an entire 12-week cycle. Can you imagine? A man sits down Page 523 with a pad and pencil 12 weeks prior to a National or World Championship, writes out the projected poundage, reps, and sets for every single session for every workout for the next three months, then never misses a single predetermined rep. Ed Coan and Doug Furness could do the same. Precision is critical. Requirement #2: No missed workouts. Requirement #3: Adding a significant amount of muscular bodyweight. Let us assume our hypothetical athlete is a fairly serious fitness buff who has several years of progressive resistance under his belt and can already bench- press 200 pounds using proper technique. Regardless if he is 6\u20321\u2033 and weighs 200 pounds with a 14% bodyfat percentile or"

    "text": "he\u2019s 5\u20326\u2033 and weighs 200 pounds with a 30% bodyfat percentile, in order to increase his bench press from 200 pounds to 300 pounds, it is critical to increase lean muscle mass. Our man will need more muscular firepower. Any \u201cfitness expert\u201d who tells the uninformed that they can add 50% to their bench press in short order with no weight gain by using (or more likely purchasing) some utopian bench-press routine is either delusional or a shyster. There is no magical, mythical exercise routine that will miraculously add 50% to the bench press without a concurrent gain in muscle mass. It takes a 10% increase in lean muscle mass to net a 50% increase in strength, and that\u2019s being optimistic. Period. Our hypothetical athlete starts off weighing 200 pounds and will need to push his lean muscle mass up 15\u201320 pounds over a 26-week period. Bench press will be trained once per week, and in each session, you will train three grips : competitive grip, the most powerful grip; wide grip, which builds starting power; and narrow grip, which builds finishing power. PHASE I: 12-WEEK BENCH-PRESS CYCLE 18 Page 524 It\u2019s possible to estimate the grip widths without bringing a tape measure to the gym. Here are several guidelines, keeping in mind that the narrow smooth bands on a standard Olympic barbell are 32 inches apart: If you are 5\u203210\u2033\u20136\u2032, the power grip will have the edge of your pinkies just inside the rings. For someone 5\u20326\u2033\u20135\u20329\u2033, the power grip will have your hands one hand- width in from the rings. If in doubt, the power grip is simply the placement that allows you to lift the most weight. Experiment. For all heights, from the power grip, the wide grip would be one hand-width out in both directions, and the narrow grip would be one hand-width in for both hands. In this phase I, the athlete jumps his lean muscle mass upward by 11%, resulting in a 30% increase in the bench press. Calories are methodically increased each week, keeping the individual anabolic. How many calories? As many as necessary to provoke the requisite weekly weight gain. How much weight gain? If you weigh less than 200, aim for one pound per week of gain. If you weigh 200+, two pounds per week. There is no hard number of calories\u2014 you just need to move the scale up. Protein must be kept high: 200+ grams per day each and every day. Page 525 Now What? Alike Yet Different Experience has shown time and time again that after an athlete has completed a successful 12-week cycle, gains need to be solidified. Engaging in yet another power cycle immediately after a successful initial cycle is doomed to failure. The natural inclination is to be greedy and continue down the same path\u2014that, however, is biological suicide. Science and empirical data have shown that the body needs 4\u20136 weeks to reset and regain its physiological bearings. The hypothalamus gland controls bodyweight, body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and circadian cycles. The interim phase allows the hypothalamus gland to recalibrate and readjust. It is equally important to \u201cget away\u201d from the three bench-press versions used in phase I. We also kick the reps upward. The ideal interim phase retains bench power by substituting heavy dumbbell pressing for barbell bench pressing. Allowing the body to \u201cforget\u201d the three exercises (competitive grip bench, wide grip bench, and narrow grip bench) makes these movements feel fresh and new when they are reinstituted in phase III, and the training effect is profound. The paused flat dumbbell bench press and the paused incline dumbbell bench press are the phase II workhorses and are performed together in each workout, once per week. Maintain tension for a one-second pause at the chest; do not relax and rest the weight on the chest. PHASE II: REESTABLISH HOMEOSTASIS 19 After the six-week interim phase, all initial gains have been solidified: the athlete\u2019s bodyweight regulation thermostat has been reset, while pushing strength has been retained. The body has \u201cforgotten\u201d flat"

Mark Bell, owner of Supertraining Gym in Sacramento, California, can bench press 854 pounds at 275 pounds bodyweight. Some world-class bench pressers use near-contortionist form to compete: a full back arch with the feet under the hips (or even closer to the head). This shortens the distance you need to press\u2014a good thing for adding poundage\u2014but it can produce injuries in novices and intermediates. Mark uses a stable slight bridge and places his feet flat on the floor. He uses this form to bench 854 pounds, so there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t use it to bench 500 pounds or less. Here is the process: Top view of set-up. Side view of before and after set-up. Notice that his heels are approximately under his knees. 1. Lie on the bench with your head half off of the edge. Page 528 2. Take your power grip (Mark has his ring fingers on the smooth bands), lift your chest to the bar, and pinch your shoulder blades together as if holding a penny between them. 3. Keeping your butt in place and your shoulders pinched, arch your back and push your shoulders down toward your hips. 20 4. Reset your back on the bench and aim to have the top of your head aligned with the edge of the bench. Mark is the size of a truck and can\u2019t quite manage. Most of you will not have that as an excuse. 5. Now your shoulders are protected. This position will be quite uncomfortable, and it should be. 6. Your legs and glutes should be fully tensed, and your toes should be pushed into the front of your shoes. If your legs and glutes wouldn\u2019t be fatigued after 20 seconds, you\u2019re not contracting them hard enough. 7. Now you\u2019re ready for the hand-off from a spotter. Never bench alone if using free weights. 21 8. The spotter should, using an alternating grip like in the deadlift (see Lamar\u2019s photos in the last chapter), lift the bar off the supports and help move it to just over your nipples. 9. Now that you\u2019re supporting the weight over your nipples, depress your shoulders fully\u2014as if you were starting a rowing movement\u2014before bending your arms. The less you have to bend your arms to get to the bottom of the movement, the safer it will be and the more weight you will be able to lift. Depressing the shoulders before bending the arms.

If struggling with the weight, you can flare your elbows slightly outward in the top 1/2 of the movement to bring the weight toward the rack, which will help with full extension. Page 530 End of Chapter Notes 17. I had, however, just set a personal record. It wasn\u2019t technical improvement, nor was it from training\u2014it was from doing max vertical jumps beforehand. This hyperclocking of the nervous system was precisely why DeFranco had me jump first. See \u201cHacking the NFL Combine.\u201d 18. Tim: The percentages are provided to help you personalize the program. Take \u201c140 (70%)\u00d78, 1 set,\u201d for example. 140 is 70% of my starting 200-lb. 1-rep max (1RM). But if your individual 1RM is 150 pounds when starting the program, you would simply multiply 150\u00d70.7 to arrive at 105 lbs. Later in the program, if you see \u201c133%,\u201d it means you multiply 150\u00d71.33 and use the resulting 199.5 lbs. for that set. 19. Please note that all weights are per dumbbell. For example, \u201c60 lbs (60%)\u201d represents 2 \u00d7 60-lb. dumbbells, which total 120 lbs., or 60% of the starting 1RM. 20. The movement is like an upright row, as if you were pulling the bar up to the top of your forehead. 21. I know some of you will do this anyway. If you do, DO NOT use collars. This allows you to dump the weight, one side at a time, if you get trapped under it. Page 531 FROM SWIMMING TO SWINGING Page 532 HOW I LEARNED TO SWIM EFFORTLESSLY IN 10 DAYS I always wanted to be Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up. I can\u2019t fly, but swimming is the next best thing. It\u2019s harmony and balance. The water is my sky. \u2014Clayton Jones, president and CEO of Rockwell Collins S wimming had always scared the hell out of me. Despite national titles in other sports, I could barely keep afloat for 30 seconds. This inability to swim well was one of my greatest insecurities and embarrassments. I\u2019d tried to learn to swim almost a dozen times, and each time, my heart jumped to 180+ beats per minute after one or two pool lengths. It was indescribably exhausting and unpleasant. No more. In the span of less than 10 days, I went from a two-length (2 \u00d7 20 yards/18.39 meters) maximum to swimming more than 40 lengths per workout in sets of two and four. From there, I moved to one kilometer in the open ocean, then onward to one to two miles. The entire progression took less than two months. This chapter will explain how I did it after everything else failed, and how you can do the same. At the end of January 2008, a good friend issued a New Year\u2019s resolution challenge: he would go all of 2008 without coffee or stimulants if I trained and finished an open-water one-kilometer race in 2008. He had grown up a competitive swimmer and convinced me that, unlike my other self-destructive habits masquerading as exercise, swimming was a life skill. Not only that, it was a pleasure I needed to share with my future children. In other words, of all the potential skills you could learn, swimming was one of the most fundamental. I agreed to the challenge. Then I tried everything, read the \u201cbest\u201d books, and \u2026 still failed. Kick boards? Tried them. I barely moved at all and, as someone who is usually good at most sports, felt humiliated and left. Hand paddles? Tried them. My shoulders will never forgive me. Isn\u2019t swimming supposed to be low-impact? Strike two. It continued for months until I was prepared to concede defeat. Then I met Page 533 Chris Sacca, formerly of Google fame and now an investor and triathlete in training, at a barbeque and told him of my plight. Before I had a chance to finish, he cut me off: \u201cI have the answer to your prayers. It revolutionized how I swim.\u201d That was the turning point.

    "text": "associated with American swim coach Terry Laughlin. I immediately ordered the book and freestyle DVD. In the first workout, without a coach, I cut my drag and water resistance at least 50%, swimming more laps than ever before in my life. By the fourth workout, I had gone from 25+ strokes per 20-yard length to an average of 11 strokes per 20-yard length. In other words, I was covering more than twice the distance with the same number of strokes (thus expending half the effort), and there was no panic or stress. In fact, I felt better after leaving the pool than before getting in. I couldn\u2019t, and still can\u2019t, believe it. I recommend reading the Total Immersion book after watching the DVD, as the drills are nearly impossible to understand otherwise. I was unable to do the exercises from pages 110 to 150 (I cannot float horizontally and have a weak kick) and became frustrated until the DVD enabled me to test technique with propulsion. My Eight Tips for Novices Here are the principles that made the biggest difference for me, and pictures follow: 1. To propel yourself forward with the least effort, focus on shoulder roll and keeping your body horizontal (least resistance), not pulling with your arms or kicking with your legs. This is counterintuitive but important, as kicking harder is the most universal suggestion for fixing swimming issues. 2. Keep yourself horizontal by keeping your head in line with your spine\u2014 Page 534 you should be looking straight down. Use the same head position that you maintain while walking, and drive your arm underwater vs. attempting to swim on the surface. See Shinji Takeuchi\u2019s underwater shots at 0:49 seconds ( www.fourhourbody.com/shinji-demo ) and Natalie Coughlin\u2019s explanation at 0:26 seconds ( www.fourhourbody.com/coughlin ). Notice how little Shinji uses his legs. The small flick serves only to help him turn his hips and drive his next arm forward. This is the technique that allows me to conserve so much energy. 3. In line with the aforementioned video of Shinji, think of swimming freestyle as swimming on alternating sides, not on your stomach. From Wikipedia\u2019s TI page: 1 \u201cActively streamline\u201d the body throughout the stroke cycle through a focus on rhythmically alternating \u201cstreamlined right side\u201d and \u201cstreamlined left side\u201d positions and consciously keeping the bodyline longer and sleeker than is typical for human swimmers. For those who have rock-climbed or bouldered, it\u2019s just like moving your hip closer to a wall to get more extension. To test this: stand with your chest to a wall and reach as high as you can with your right arm. Then turn your right hip so it\u2019s touching the wall and reach again with your right arm. Making this small rotation, you\u2019ll gain three to six inches. Lengthen your vessel and you travel farther on each stroke. It adds up fast. Below is what a full stroke should look like, demonstrated by TI founder Terry Loughlin. Notice the minimal flick of the legs used to rotate the hips and body. This sequence of photos should be your bible for efficient swimming: Page 535 4. Penetrate the water with your fingers angled down and fully extend your arm well beneath your head. Extend it lower and farther than you think you should. This downward water pressure on the arms will bring your legs up and decrease drag. It will almost feel like you\u2019re swimming downhill. The first photo below illustrates the typical inefficient \u201creach,\u201d and the second illustrates the proper point of entrance, much closer to the head. Page 536 Once the arm enters the water, it extends down at an angle. Page 537 Don\u2019t impinge the shoulder by lifting it too high. If you rotate your shoulders properly, it\u2019s not necessary. 5. Focus on increasing stroke length (SL) instead of stroke rate (SR). Attempt to glide farther on each downstroke and decrease the number of strokes per lap. 6. Stretch your extended underwater arm and turn your body (not just your head) to breathe. For each breath, you should feel the"

    "text": "stretch in your lats (back) on your lower side, as if you were reaching for a cookie jar high on a shelf a few inches out of reach. This will bring your head closer to the surface and make it easier to breathe. Some triathletes turn almost to their backs and face skyward to avoid short gasps and oxygen debt (tip from Dave Scott, six-time Ironman world champion). In your first practices, breathe on every other stroke. 2 Once you become more comfortable breathing on your \u201cweak\u201d side, I encourage you to practice breathing every third stroke, which will force you to alternate sides. Remember to exhale fully and slowly while your face is underwater. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll need to exhale and inhale when you bring your head out, which will mean feeling rushed, swallowing water, and exhausting yourself. Remember to exhale underwater, and \u201cextend to air\u201d (video: www.fourhourbody.com/extend-air ). Look for your hand. 7. Experiment with hand swapping as a drill. It\u2019s difficult to remember all of the mechanical details while actually swimming. I short-circuited trying to follow half a dozen rules at once. The single drill that forced me to do most other things correctly is hand swapping. This is the visualization I found most useful: focus on keeping your lead arm Page 538 fully extended until your other arm comes over and penetrates the water around the extended arm\u2019s forearm. This encourages you to swim on your sides, extends your stroke length, and forces you to engage in what is referred to as \u201cfront- quadrant\u201d swimming. All good things. This one exercise cut an additional three to four strokes off each lap of freestyle. 8. Forget about workouts and focus on \u201cpractice.\u201d You are training your nervous system to perform counterintuitive movements, not training your aerobic system. If you feel strained, you\u2019re not using the proper technique. Stop and review rather than persist through the pain and develop bad habits. Gear and Getting Started Ready to give it a shot? If you have a phobia of swimming, you\u2019re almost there. Don\u2019t screw it up by choosing the wrong gear or the wrong pool. Some closing recommendations: 1. Gents, don\u2019t swim in board shorts. I tried this in Brazil and it\u2019s like swimming with a parachute behind you. Terrible. Get some Euro-style Speedos and streamline. Be cool on the beach and opt for efficiency in the water. 2. Get good goggles. I tried them all, from Speedo Vanquishers to Swedish swim goggles. In almost all tests, I needed to tighten the various straps every 100\u2013125 meters to prevent chlorinated water from blinding me. I now use nothing besides the much-acclaimed (and rightly so) Aqua Sphere Kaiman goggles, which are well sealed and can be tightened without removing them from your head. Leakage is nonexistent. These are the only goggles I\u2019ll ever need. 3. Start practicing in a pool that is short and shallow. Use a lane in the shallow end (four feet or less in depth) and opt for a pool that is no longer than 20 yards. It\u2019s easier to focus on technique in shorter pools. Once I adapted to 20 yards, I moved to 25 yards, and then (once I could do 10 \u00d7 100 yards with 30\u201345 seconds of rest between sets), I moved to an Olympic-sized 50-meter pool. Hard to Believe I never ever thought I\u2019d say this but: I love swimming. Page 539 This is RIDICULOUS, as I have always HATED swimming. Now, whenever possible, I make time to do laps. It\u2019s like moving meditation. I\u2019ll swim for two hours and sneak out later to get in an extra session. I still can\u2019t believe it. What about the one-kilometer open-water race? Oh, I didn\u2019t forget about that. I wasn\u2019t able to find a practical race scheduled near me in the last quarter of 2008 (as much as I would have loved to visit Bonaire, it was a bit out of the way), but my friend excused it. For good reason. Four months before my December deadline, I had gone home to Long Island to spend my birthday with my family and closest friends. One morning, I woke up early and went to the ocean.

I reached the lifeguard stand and passed it, continuing on another 200 yards or so, when I decided to get out of the water. There was no fatigue and no concern; I\u2019d just proven my point. To myself. Walking up the sand, I have never been prouder or felt more alive. I looked around like a 21-year-old Mike Tyson after winning the heavyweight championship of the world. I was, for that moment, king of my universe. One of my deepest-seated lifelong insecurities was gone and would never return. The elation was indescribable. I encourage all of you, whether you want to overcome your fears or win the Ironman, to give TI training a test drive. It\u2019s the first instruction that\u2019s made sense to me and is 100% responsible for the fastest transformative experience I\u2019ve ever had in the world of sports. Enjoy.

Get your goggles ready: From Rocky: \u2026 I tried this in the gym and in 2 days have gone from 2 laps to 25 laps. I was telling friends yesterday, that in my entire adult life if I had to pick 3 things that have held me in awe this would be amongst those three. From Diego: Tim, \u2026 I had the biggest fear of water my entire life and finally stepped out of my comfort zone. Last month, just one (1) month ago, I was fighting water, trying to stay afloat. Definitely survival mode \u2026 I started learning [Total Immersion], read the TI book (it\u2019s literally in pieces now since I\u2019d take it to the pool and leave it at the end of my lane soaking water each time I\u2019d reference it) and watched several videos. I continually practiced \u2026 It\u2019s been only a month \u2026 Last week I did a 1.5 mile swim in the pool nonstop \u2026 Today I made it to a 2.5 mile swim and only stopped because the facility was closing. I\u2019m graduating to open water now. It\u2019s been a lifelong dream of mine to perform in the Ironman, and my times, a month after learning, are below the cutoff times for the 2.4 mile swim. Thank you so much! I hope to meet you some day. Your friend in Florida, Diego TOOLS AND TRICKS Total Immersion, Freestyle Made Easy , DVD ( www.fourhourbody.com/immersion ) This DVD was the reason I was able to completely overcome my fear of swimming, and actually learn to love it.

Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but we were in the middle of a blizzard. Getting a taxi was next to impossible, as all of them were either full, or covered in powder and spinning in place. \u201cCan\u2019t we just grab a taxi from here to the hotel?\u201d Jaime, my coach for the day, had asked earlier. Taxis from Pier 40 on the water in Manhattan? Not on a Saturday night with a snowstorm crippling the city. So we started walking. My date with Everlast would continue. Jogging through Times Square in slush with an 80-pound boxing heavybag across my shoulders it was. But I didn\u2019t mind. For the first time in my life, I felt like Babe Ruth. Obsessive Batting Disorder Jaime Cevallos isn\u2019t normal. Ever since he was a kid, when his classmates were off to prom or driving to house parties hooting and hollering, he was in his front yard, hitting baseballs through a tire hung from a tree branch. He took notes, made changes, and took more notes. Now Major League Baseball players pay him to look at those notes, because Jaime has figured out how to improve some important numbers. One of them is \u201cslugging percentage.\u201d Slugging percentage, 3 the bread-and-butter of baseball hitter analysis, is the number of bases run, divided by the total number of appearances at the plate. The higher the percentage, the better. The Rain Man of slugging was Babe Ruth, and his 1921 record stood until Barry Bonds and his 20-inch arms came along in 2001. Tweaking this number is important. In 303 plate appearances before working with Jaime, Ben Zobrist had three home runs and a .259 slugging percentage. In the 309 plate appearances after Page 544 working with Jaime, Zobrist hit 17 home runs with a .520 slugging percentage. In 2009, Zobrist won the team MVP award for the Rays, finishing the season with a .297 batting average and 27 home runs. Going from three home runs to 27 in approximately the same number of at- bats is astounding. In the majors, it\u2019s unheard of. If only God can make a great hitter, does that make Jaime God? Or was he just seeing something that other people weren\u2019t? From God to Granularity Ted Williams once famously remarked, \u201cHitting a baseball is the hardest thing to do in sports.\u201d \u2026 Jaime Cevallos has made it his life\u2019s mission to conquer the unconquerable. \u2014Fort Worth Star-Telegram This leads us to the snowstorm. I had invited Jaime to demonstrate his goods on a blank canvas: me. He had flown from Dallas, Texas, to land with a boatload of gear (including the heavybag) on the western edge of New York City. Armed with a radar gun, video camera, laptop, and a slew of baseball bats coated in pine tar, he then set out to turn me into a home run hitter in one session. The setting would be the subarctic batting cages of Pier 40, and each ball would be hit off a tee that put ball height at 35.25 inches to eliminate the variability of pitches. Perhaps it was the salsa music that pumped in from an adjacent room, where aspiring Dominican pros were playing cards, but after just 45 minutes of molding and training, here were the ball speed results, measured with the radar gun off the bat: Before instruction (mph): 68, 69, 48, 50, 60, 47, 49, 64, 42, 68, 71, 67, 42 Before-training average: 57.307 mph After: 58, 61, 52, 63, 54, 65, 75, 76, 70, 78, 65, 61, 70 After-training (first round) average: 65.23 mph After After (after the second round with Mr. Miyagi): 73, 70, 66, 66, 73, 69, 78, 70, 59, 74, 68, 76, 69 Page 545 After-training (second round) average: 70.076 mph I was still no Mark McGwire, but jumping from 57 miles per hour to 70 in off-"

    "text": "bat ball speed translates into major distance gains. In terms of home run potential, what does this really mean? Using a 45% angle incline on each hit, here\u2019s the difference: For 57.31 mph (84.05 ft./sec.), distance is 158 ft. For 70.08 mph (102.78 ft./sec.), distance is 214 ft. (a 35.4% increase) 4 What follows are the fundamental principles and exercises we focused on in our 45 minutes. Picking Your Angles THE BIG THREE The Cushion The Cushion occurs when the front heel has landed, prior to the forward swing. In the Cushion, it is best to have optimal torque created between the shoulders and hips. Jaime calls this Angle S . A good Angle S measurement is 25 degrees. Increasing Angle S is also one of the ways to \u201cbuy\u201d time if the pitch is off- speed (\u201coff-speed\u201d means it\u2019s a curveball, changeup, knuckleball, or any pitch that is significantly slower than a fastball). Off-speed pitches are meant to lure the hitter into opening up the front shoulder and losing the torque between his hips and shoulders. The battle between pitcher and hitter is really a fight for the hitter\u2019s form. The pitcher\u2019s job is to (1) throw strikes and (2) lure the hitter into Page 546 weak hitting positions. The Slot The \u201cSlot\u201d position of Babe Ruth. Two things define a proper Slot position: (1) the back elbow drops to the player\u2019s side, and (2) the spine angle stays vertical. The Slot is the kinetic link in action: the arms deferring to the more powerful legs and hips in order to work as a whip through the strike zone. See the picture of Ben Zobrist on the first day he filmed with Jaime in the winter of 2007. Next to it is Ben during the All-Star break midseason in 2008. His much-improved Slot position is obvious. Zobrist went on a tear from that point in the season, averaging one home run every 18 at-bats (prior to that, it had been one home run for every 101 at-bats). He later made the 2009 All-Star team and was named Rays\u2019 team MVP. Ben before, Ben after Impact Position The Impact position is the thumbprint of the swing. In this case, it tells you the ability of a hitter rather than their identity. There are two components to the Impact position: the E and W angles. E is the angle between the upper arm and forearm, which we want as small as possible (aim for 80 degrees), and W is the Page 547 angle between the top wrist and the bat, which needs to be as large as possible (aim for 180 degrees). This one position paints the entire picture of a player\u2019s swing. The Impact position correlation to great hitting is extraordinary. Good impact (left) and bad impact (right). We want E small and W big. But Impact position becomes more actionable when we convert it to a number, the 80/20 metric to focus on: CSR. Before and after, with CSR overlaid: 265 before vs. 345 after. Babe Ruth, the reigning king of CSR. Page 548 CSR (Cevallos Swing Rating) = 3 (180 \u2013 E) + W . The CSR number contains unusual insight involving two simple-to-measure angles at the point of impact: the first at the elbow (E), and the second between the forearm and the bat itself (W). Here are just two benefits of a high CSR swing: 1. A high CSR swing is naturally a tighter swing. Since the swing is closer to the torso, thanks to the elbow-in Slot position, pitches that are too far outside of the strike zone are unreachable. The hitter with the tighter swing is forced into better pitch selection because he can\u2019t physically swing at pitches outside of the strike zone. It\u2019s analogous to how novice boxers will sometimes practice proper chin position (down) by holding a wallet between their chin and chest. If the boxer keeps his chin down and makes this position instinctual, it will be hard to knock him out. If a batter doesn\u2019t let his elbow leave the Slot position through the strike zone, he can\u2019t reach for bad pitches, and it will be harder to strike him out. 2. In a high-CSR swing, contact with the ball is made further back, closer to the catcher. This naturally gives the batter more time to"

    "text": "assess the pitch before initiating the swing. Jaime elaborates: \u201cA high CSR is not just indicative of power (mass \u00d7 acceleration). A high CSR is also a sign of consistency, as the back arm remains passive, allowing the body to whip the bat into the hitting zone early and keep it there for a long time, creating a long AOI [Area of Impact, covered next].\u201d Page 549 Historical CSRs: Contrasted with CSR, SLG is essentially a measurement of a player\u2019s power and OPS is a measurement of both a player\u2019s power and consistency. AREA OF IMPACT (AOI) Big AOI\u2014good. Small AOI\u2014bad. Page 550 It is possible to achieve a high CSR while doing something that reduces power, such as having your front arm away from your chest (\u00e0 la Derek Jeter). Much more mass, and therefore force, can be transferred to the ball if the front arm is tight to the chest, because the mass of the torso is transferred through the arm directly into the bat. It should be one unit. Advanced Concepts (Important for live pitches) See the illustrations of good and bad Areas of Impact (AOI) on the previous pages. AOI is an indication of a hitter\u2019s level of consistency. It indicates how long the bat is square enough to the pitch to supply adequate force to the oncoming ball. You will notice that the Slot position and good CSR produce a long AOI. The longer the AOI, the higher the likelihood of hitting the ball, even if the hitter misjudges pitch speed. Angle L measures bat-lag: how late your bat comes through the strike zone. Lag is achieved with a slight wrist \u201ctwitch\u201d of the top of the bat toward your spine while the bat is still well behind you. The smaller the angle L, the more bat speed will ultimately be generated. The key is to achieve a small angle L early in the Slot position. If you achieve bat-lag too late in the swing, as the bat is traveling through the hitting zone, it will shrink your AOI. Angle L Practicing Your Angles The best drill for honing a new Impact position is hitting the impact bag (usually Page 551 a heavybag), pausing at impact, and checking your position. Do this for 10 minutes, then practice hitting balls off of a tee, duplicating the same movement. This was the single exercise I performed while with Jaime. It works like gangbusters. Hacking CSR and related biomechanics is a force multiplier (figuratively and literally) that can be used to transform mediocre hitters into MVP hitters. God might create great hitters, but science also gives you the tools to build them. The Exercise That Increased My Distance 35% Note that the toes and knees aim forward when the front leg steps forward. For a right-handed batter, the toes are now pointed at approximately 10 A.M. if 12:00 noon is where they were pointing in the second picture. This opens up the hips and allows greater torque. On the left: To prevent backward lean and ensure that my spine was perpendicular to the ground, I focused on keeping my left shoulder away from my left ear. On the right: For the final impact, the largest speed increases (and sound increases) were achieved when I focused on driving the right hip forward by forcefully extending the front left leg. If you drill this forceful extension, expect better speeds\u2014and intense soreness the next day\u2014to follow.

A\u2019s general manager Billy Beane believed that objective science could beat subjective scouts. He hired PhDs in statistics to help him acquire undervalued players based on neglected numbers, like ground-outs for pitchers. Even if you hate baseball, you will love this book.

I\u2019m indebted to Professor Robert Adair, Sterling Professor Emeritus of physics at Yale University and author of the classic The Physics of Baseball , for this help with these numbers. His commentary: \u201cThe distances vary with the air temperature, wind velocity, and backspin of the ball. Also, we don\u2019t have perfect values for the air resistance, which varies a little with the ball axis of rotation.\u2026 I took the backspins as 1,030 rpm and 1,260 rpm. The balls will go a little further at 40 degrees (57.31) and 35 degrees (70.08).\u201d The projected distances varied for almost every PhD Jaime and I consulted, but the before-after differences were always large. Some physicists predicted slightly more significant increases approximating 50%, from roughly 180 feet to roughly 250 feet when accounting for air resistance.

Frank Baum, author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz D avid Blaine first became interested in magic at age four, when his grandmother bought him a deck of Tarot cards. One year later, at the ripe age of five, he announced to his mom that he wanted to be a showman. Why? There was an older man in the neighborhood who sat on his apartment stoop and never displayed any emotion. David had used one of his card tricks to make him laugh. By the time Blaine was a teenager, magic and illusion consumed all of his free time. He would later describe it as \u201clike an addiction, an obsessive compulsive disorder.\u201d 5 His deft close-up card effects caught the eye of billionaire Jeffrey Steiner at a bar mitzvah gig, and Steiner decided to take the then-18-year-old David to Saint- Tropez to impress house guests. In short order, David was performing for Jack Nicholson, and the streets of Brooklyn had been replaced by playgrounds for the rich and famous. It was just the beginning. By 2002 he was on top of the world. Literally. Looking for challenges beyond illusion, David stood unharnessed at the top of an 83-foot-tall, 22-inch-wide column in New York\u2019s Bryant Park until he hallucinated. It took 35 hours for the buildings behind him to become animal heads. He then jumped off into nothing but cardboard boxes. David\u2019s new label: endurance artist. He had been buried alive in April 1999, spending a week underground in a plastic coffin. He ate and drank nothing but a few tablespoons of water each day. He had been frozen alive in November 2000, encasing himself in a block of ice for nearly 64 hours. The ice was broken away with chainsaws, and he spent a month in recovery before he could walk again. Impressive, yes. But these stunts didn\u2019t satisfy him. Looking for bigger and bolder challenges, he set his sights on the breath-holding world record. How Page 555 hard could it be to fake?

Then it occurred to him that he could simply bite the bullet and take the craziest approach of all: actually holding his breath. Traveling from Navy SEAL training to the tropics, he figured it out. Then, for four months, David held the Guinness world record for oxygen-assisted static apnea (holding your breath after breathing pure oxygen): 17 minutes and 4.4 seconds. His record was surpassed by Tom Sietas on September 19, 2008, but this wasn\u2019t surprising. Tom is a professional free diver and built for it. David was an anomaly, a product of pure conditioning. This is why, when I bumped into him at the medical conference TEDMED, I begged him to train me. See, I am also an anomaly. When I was born premature, my left lung collapsed. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d held my breath for more than one minute. He agreed, and I joined a small group in a closed-door training session the next evening. The training lasted 15 minutes. The results? Before: 40 secs. After: 3 mins. and 33 secs. (!!!) Out of roughly 12 TEDMED attendees he taught, all but one beat Harry Houdini\u2019s lifelong record of 3 minutes and 30 seconds. One woman held her breath for more than five minutes. Roni Zeiger MD, Google\u2019s Chief Health Strategist, topped out at an unbelievable 4:05 and remembers the experience vividly: \u201cWe were tricking our bodies into doing something, and the tingling in my fingers and lightheadedness made that clear. For me, it was like skydiving\u2014I felt powerful, vulnerable, am lucky to have done it, and I probably won\u2019t do it again.\u201d The David Blaine Method DISCLAIMER : This is for informational purposes only. Do not attempt in water or without proper supervision. Page 556 Here\u2019s how we all did it. First and foremost, the disclaimer is not a joke. David himself has almost died on several occasions. See the video in \u201cTools and Tricks\u201d for a visual warning: you will watch firsthand as David goes into convulsions underwater. The notes that became this chapter were taken on a scrap of paper while performing the exercises. Much of it was written after I lost almost all sensation in my hands following the purging exercises, and after colors began to morph. After 3 minutes and 20 seconds, I was shaking. FYI, the above side effects are all common. DEFINITIONS Deep breathing: Taking a big breath in through the mouth, holding for one second, and then exhaling for 10 seconds through your almost-closed mouth with tongue pressed against your lower teeth. It should be a hissing exhalation and make a tsssssss sound. All breathing and exercises\u2014both inhalation and exhalation\u2014are performed through the mouth. Purging: A strong exhalation as if you were trying to blow a toy sailboat across a pool, followed by a big but faster inhalation. David\u2019s cheeks were puffed out as he demonstrated the exhalation. (Imagine the Big Bad Wolf blowing the pigs\u2019 houses down.) Be careful not to heave or rock back and forth, as this wastes oxygen. Keep as still as possible. Semi-purging: Breathing somewhere between the above two. More forceful than deep breathing but less forceful than full purging. Used for recovering after each time trial. THE STEPS All durations are in MIN:SEC format, and everything was done seated. 1:30 deep breathing 1:15 purging (if you feel like you\u2019re going to pass out, do it less intensely) Hold breath for a target 1:30, no more After that hold: Take 3 semi-purge breaths 1:30 deep breathing 1:30 purging Hold breath for a target 2:30, no more Page 557 After that hold: Take 3 semi-purge breaths 2:00 deep breathing 1:45 purging Hold breath for as long as possible After exhalation: Take 3\u201310 hard semi-purge breaths until you recover Other Observations David\u2019s record using the above method is 7:47, and his heart rate dropped below 20 beats per minute when he did it.

He also suggested going from A to Z in your head during time trials, visualizing friends whose names start with each letter as you go. This was incredibly useful. Use celebrities or historical figures when needed. This serves to distract you from the fact that you\u2019re holding your breath. The more frequently you check your time, the shorter your ultimate time will be. Too much focus on the time creates tension. All of the test subjects, including me, had a harder time holding their breath when David announced the time every five seconds instead of every 30 seconds. In subsequent attempts, I had someone else watch the time for me and announce at two minutes, three minutes, then every 10 seconds. After taking your big inhalations for the time trials, do not let any air out whatsoever. Holding it all will improve times and is important protective training for water-based breath holding. Why? If you pass out in the water (not good), you want the uncontrolled release of bubbles to indicate to those supervising you that you\u2019ve passed out. It is easier to hold your breath if you haven\u2019t eaten for four to six hours. It is also easier to hold your breath if you have less body mass to feed oxygen.

To date, in this 20+ year experiment, 37 percent of the \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d group have died due to causes related to old age. The calorie-counting group has a much lower death rate, almost two-thirds lower . Cancel our reservations at the Cheesecake Factory! In fact, it\u2019s time to cancel dinner forever! Or, wait a second, is that really all there is to the story? Roger Cohen, whose father, a doctor, studied baboons all his life, shared a less sensationalized perspective in a New York Times op-ed titled \u201cThe Meaning of Life,\u201d excerpted here: Which brings me to low-cal Canto and high-cal Owen: Canto looks drawn, weary, ashen and miserable in his thinness, mouth slightly agape, features pinched, eyes blank, his expression screaming, \u201cPlease, no, not another plateful of seeds!\u201d Well-fed Owen, by contrast, is a happy camper with a wry smile, every inch the laid-back simian, plump, eyes twinkling, full mouth relaxed, skin glowing, exuding wisdom as if he\u2019s just read Kierkegaard and concluded that \u201cLife must be lived forward, but can only be understood backward.\u201d It\u2019s the difference between the guy who got the marbleized rib-eye and the Page 563 guy who got the oh-so-lean filet. Or between the guy who got a Ch\u00e2teau Grand Pontet St. Emilion with his brie and the guy who got water. As Edgar notes in King Lear, \u201cRipeness is all.\u201d You don\u2019t get to ripeness by eating apple peel for breakfast.\u2026 When life extension supplants life quality as a goal, you get the desolation of Canto the monkey. Living to 120 holds zero appeal for me. Canto looks like he\u2019s itching to be put out of his misery.\u2026 We don\u2019t understand what the mind secretes. The process of aging remains full of enigma. But I\u2019d bet on jovial Owen outliving wretched Canto.\u2026 Laughter extends life. There\u2019s little of it in the low-cal world and little doubt pudgy Owen will have the last laugh. 1 If your goal is to live as long as possible, there is a long list, an endless list, of things to avoid. The good news is that life-extension need not be complicated. For the gents, it may be as simple as blocking a few websites and curbing a little maleness. The pro-ejaculation lobby slipped up in 1992, when the New York Times broke the story: I N W ORM, AT L EAST , M AKING S PERM IS F OUND TO S HORTEN A M ALE\u2019S L IFE See, Dr. Wayne Van Voorhies of the University of Arizona had allowed nematodes, also called \u201croundworms,\u201d to kill themselves by copulating.

Never got to see the grandkids grow up, never got to play golf at St. Andrews. It\u2019s a sad tale of weary scrotums (or whatever worms have as scrotums). \u201cThe genes and biochemical processes nematodes use are the same as those that humans and other mammals use,\u201d elaborated Dr. Philip Anderson of the University of Wisconsin.

It\u2019s like finding out that flossing is bad for you. No more tiring sex or aching wrists. Hassle removed. And you might live 37% longer! Page 564 In the quest for longer life, it pays dividends to err on the side of caution, to avoid any unnecessary risks or unknowns. To live, after all, you don\u2019t need much. Air, water, gruel with some protein, and shelter will cover all the bases. One could therefore suggest no venturing outside the home, no driving or traveling, and certainly no exposure to other humans, who could be sick with cat flu or diaper rash. Naturally, this level of risk-avoidance leads to what we all want: a long-ass shitty life. But let\u2019s assume you\u2019re one of the few (billion) people who wants a degree of fun and freedom in life. The real question then becomes not \u201cHow can I extend life at all costs?\u201d but rather \u201cHow can I increase the length of my life without severely decreasing my quality of life?\u201d The most basic approach would be to eat, drink, and be merry, and believe that a few more laughs and tasty calories will beat most lab theories in the long run. I believe this to be true. The second complementary approach, which can be followed right along with the first, is to consider therapies that are minimally inconvenient and that, based on the scientific literature, should work in humans. T HE S HORT L IST The short list of therapies should then be ethically filtered. \u201cEthics\u201d can be nebulous, but here\u2019s an example: If you\u2019re a woman and want to buy cancer insurance, you could opt to have a full-term pregnancy before age 20. Some scientists believe it could be \u201cthe most effective natural means of protecting against breast cancer\u201d due to the hormone hCG. Should you therefore have children before age 20? I suggest that life- extension is not a good enough reason, particularly since another life is involved. This option is therefore omitted from our list. Separating the wheat from the chaff, we might consider four candidates that make the cut: \u2022 Resveratrol \u2022 Injections of the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin 2 \u2022 Alzheimer\u2019s vaccines Page 565 \u2022 Stem cell therapies These might just get you to 200 or beyond, especially if used in combination. And I\u2019m avoiding them. But \u2026 why? I believe, as do some scientists, that focusing on global therapies (drugs or treatments with broad molecular effects) without long-term human data is barking up the wrong tree, a tree fraught with unpredictable side effects. Take resveratrol, for example, which is currently available over- the- counter. It is effective in extending lifespan in nearly all species tested, but it can also block or activate estrogen receptors. Could this affect other metabolic or hormonal feedback loops, disrupting fertility if taken routinely? It\u2019s impossible to say, which is why I\u2019ll use resveratrol short-term at higher doses for endurance while tracking blood markers, but I won\u2019t use it indefinitely for life-extension. Telomerase activators like TA-65, another example, are purported to extend our chromosomal countdown clocks called \u201ctelomeres.\u201d TA-65 can cost up to $15,000 per year. Is it possible that, by amplifying cell replication, you increase the likelihood of dangerous cancerous growth? Perhaps. It\u2019s simply beyond our technology to guarantee one outcome or another, so I\u2019m avoiding TA-65 as well. But if not in global therapies, where is the promised land? Until we can go to Walmart and get a RoboCop makeover with regenerative medicine, there are a few alternatives in a second short list. These are the protocols I am currently using. All of them are low-cost, low-tech, and low-risk. Most of them also provide athletic or body composition benefits, even if their"

CYCLES OF 5\u201310 GRAMS OF CREATINE MONOHYDRATE (COST: $20/MONTH) Creatine monohydrate, popular among power athletes since its commercialization in 1993, has recently become a candidate for minimizing or preventing the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases. There are almost 20 years of published research involving human use of creatine monohydrate. Since my family has Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s on both paternal and maternal sides, it is low-cost insurance: I\u2019m ingesting 5\u201310 grams of creatine monohydrate powder per day for two consecutive weeks every two months. If you choose to use this protocol, I suggest tracking and trending Page 566 hepatic enzymes, BUN, and all the usual blood testing suspects to ensure no kidney problems. Complications are rare, but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Nowhere is this truer than in life- extension. 2. INTERMITTENT FASTING (IF) AND PROTEIN CYCLING (COST: FREE) What if poor, hungry Canto only needed to fast on occasion to extend his life? Constant caloric deprivation isn\u2019t without risks, after all. The decline in sex hormone production alone can cause amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation) and bone thinning, among other problems. It turns out that you can mimic, even exceed, the supposed life- extending effects of caloric restriction with intermittent fasting (IF). This can be true even if you consume twice as many calories as normal during your \u201con\u201d times, resulting in no total decrease in weekly calories. There are several versions of IF and semi-IF protocols popular among experimental subcultures: Fast-5: Fast for 19 hours beginning at bedtime, followed by five hours of eating as much as necessary to satisfy hunger. This is popular for moderate weight loss, which typically appears starting in the third week and averages one pound of loss per week thereafter. 3 Some research suggests IF confers the same life-extension benefits as caloric restriction only when calories are consumed during daylight hours. This would, if accurate, make the Fast-5 better for fat loss than longevity. ADCR: Alternate Day Caloric Restriction (ADCR) requires that calories be cut 50\u201380% every other day. It has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, autoimmune disease, and even asthma after just two weeks. Protein cycling: Dr. Ron Mignery, author of the Protein-Cycling Diet , suggests that even a single day per week of restricting protein to no more than 5% of maintenance calories can produce effects similar to extended caloric restriction. If the mechanism of IF or CR is a genetic self-preservation response, 4 protein cycling makes sense. There are no essential dietary carbohydrates. Simply reducing calories (or carbs) wouldn\u2019t necessarily qualify as a biological emergency. On the other hand, even brief absences of essential amino acids like lysine might be enough to flip the switch. The \u201cswitch\u201d in our context is triggering a process of cellular housekeeping called autophagy, the purpose of which is, in Dr. Mignery\u2019s words, \u201cto clear the cell of degraded and aggregated Page 567 proteins that are not being handled by the other recycling mechanisms of the cell.\u201d In principle, if you clear the junk out faster than it builds up, you postpone or reverse aging. I\u2019m currently experimenting with both 18-hour 5 and one-day protein cycling, which I believe (and it\u2019s pure conjecture) can also increase subsequent protein synthesis during overfeeding. For muscular growth phases, I have used the 18- hour protein cycling once per week precisely for this reason, usually ending between noon and 2 P.M . on my Saturday cheat day. Below is a sample menu for one day of less than 5% protein, adapted from Dr. Mignery. It is distinctly non-Slow-Carb. Once you\u2019ve cried a tear of dietary misery, I\u2019ll tell you what I do: Miscellaneous breakfast \u2014Breakfast can include wheat-based (lysine- deficient) products such as toast, muffins, or bagels,"

    "text": "provided that wheat is the only substantial source of protein, and its calories are heavily diluted with calories from non-protein sources (butter, sugar, juice, fruit, etc.). Toast with mushrooms, onions, and gravy \u2014You can thicken the fat or drippings from meat with starch to make a gravy and drizzle it over the toast, mushrooms, and onions. Spinach with vinegar \u2014Microwaved frozen spinach (<2 cups) can be flavored with any kind of vinegar for a near-protein-free dish with the warmth and chew of meat. Meat substitutes \u2014A microwaved slice of eggplant can fill a sandwich and give something of the shape and texture of a lunch meat. Black olives can also provide something of the texture of meat without the protein. Bean substitutes \u2014Beans and peas are fairly high in protein and cannot be eaten in the restriction phase of protein cycling. But you can substitute spheres of cassava starch called tapioca pearls. They are a staple of tropical cuisine and are available in a wide range of sizes and colors. You may be familiar with them if you have ever had bubble tea. So, here\u2019s what I do: First, I drizzle fat gravy over a bowl of tapioca pearls. Kidding. I fast following an early Friday dinner (6 P.M .) and then, around 10 A.M . the next morning (16 hours later), I eat 1 cup spinach with vinegar and spices, one slice of sourdough toast with lots of butter, and enjoy it all with a large glass of grapefruit juice. Delish. Sometime after noon, I\u2019ll then head off to eat my Page 568 usual chocolate croissants and continue cheat day as a binge monster. 3. THE LOST ART OF BLEEDING (COST: FREE) Thought bloodletting went out of fashion around the time of the Salem witch trials? Not entirely. I\u2019m betting on a major resurgence, and it all has to do with excess iron. More than estrogen, it\u2019s thought to partially explain why post-menopausal (but not pre-menopausal) women have a similar incidence of heart attack to men. I\u2019ve donated blood since 2001 to be on the safe side. And I\u2019m not alone. The New England Centenarian Study, conducted by Boston University\u2019s School of Medicine, is the world\u2019s largest and most comprehensive ongoing study of \u201ccentenarians,\u201d or people who live past 100. Dr. Tom Perls, director of the study and an associate professor of medicine, gives blood every eight weeks to mimic the loss of iron due to menstruation, which he believes will increase his longevity: \u201cIron is a critical factor in our cells\u2019 ability to produce those nasty molecules called free radicals that play an important role in aging.\u2026 It may be as simple as having less iron in your body.\u201d There is ample evidence that iron reduction through phlebotomy (bloodletting) can not only improve insulin sensitivity, but also reduce cancer- specific and all-cause deaths. High iron stores have been correlated to an increased number of heart attacks in otherwise symptom-free males, and blood donation has conversely been correlated to a decrease in \u201ccardiovascular incidents.\u201d Drs. Michael and Mary Dan Eades suggest aiming for blood ferritin levels of 50 mg/dl, which, if your levels aren\u2019t over 400, can usually be achieved with 1\u20134 whole blood donations spread two months apart. 6 No leeches required. If you\u2019d like to increase the removal of pesticides and other environmental toxins normally stored in fat, you can do two things: schedule to donate a double portion of plasma, and drink a cup of caffeinated coffee about 60 minutes before going to the center. Donated blood will always contain such toxins, so you are not being a bad citizen by temporarily increasing their excretion. Though some scientists argue that iron depletion is necessary for full cardiac benefits, I see no harm in acting on the positive implications of dozens of other studies. Consensus won\u2019t come anytime soon, but even if you don\u2019t extend your own life, you might save someone else\u2019s. Page 569 Karma is what karma does.

TOOLS AND TRICKS Donating Blood If you have high iron levels (as I did after adding orange juice to my diet), an easy and karmically positive way to lower those levels is by donating blood. Any of the following sites can help you find a local center, schedule an appointment, and save lives. American Red Cross ( www.redcrossblood.org/make-donation ) Bonfils Blood Center ( www.fourhourbody.com/bonfils ) National Blood Service (For people in England and Wales: www.blood.co.uk ) Alcor ( www.alcor.org ) Perhaps you\u2019d like to store your body in ice-free cryosuspension at the first sign of terminal illness, just in case technology catches up? There\u2019s nowhere better than Alcor in Scottsdale, Arizona, where gems such as Ted Williams\u2019s head are allegedly stored. Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever by Ray Kurzweil ( www.fourhourbody.com/transcend ) Kurzweil, called the \u201crightful heir to Thomas Edison\u201d by Inc. magazine, proposes that those interested in \u201cradical life extension\u201d should make it their immediate goal to live through the next 20 or so years, in order to see advances like DNA reprogramming and submicroscopic, cell-repairing robots. This book outlines the nine key areas for extending your life. Page 570 Protein-Cycling Diet by Dr. Ron Mignery ( www.fourhourbody.com/protein- cycle ) According to this book, available for free at this link, a single day per week of restricting protein to no more than 5% of maintenance calories can produce effects similar to extended caloric restriction. Methuselah Foundation ( www.mfoundation.org ) The Methuselah Foundation is a nonprofit medical charity dedicated to extending healthy human life. The foundation also offers the NewOrgan Network for those in need of replacement organs, making it easier to reach out to friends and family for support. Immortality Institute ( www.imminst.org ) The Immortality Institute is an international not-for-profit. Its mission is \u201cto conquer the blight of involuntary death.\u201d Though I don\u2019t love the word blight, I do love the forum on this site, where hundreds of self-experimenters (including published scientists who post pseudonymously) report on surprising results and advances from using experimental supplements, drugs, and other off-label therapies.

Perhaps just as you haven\u2019t connected the dots with some subjects in this book. After all, in a knowledge economy, what\u2019s the value of deadlifting more or losing 2% bodyfat? Of hitting a home run? In a word: transfer. My father lost 70+ pounds of fat in 10 months and tripled his strength. During his annual checkup, his doctor declared that he might live forever. The physical changes were incredible, but the curious side effects of the program were the strongest incentives to continue. As my dad explained: It\u2019s very odd. I used to feel like the invisible man, but now people more readily ask my opinion and take me more seriously. I went from not being noticed to being noticed. Quite apart from the aesthetic and performance benefit, there\u2019s a huge social benefit. I lost my invisibility. Also, after losing 50 or 60 pounds and doing what you once thought impossible, you start to see the other \u201cimpossibles\u201d\u2014doubling income in 12 months or whatever\u2014as \u201cpossibles.\u201d This book is a Trojan horse full of unexpected transfers. It\u2019s intended to make you a better all-around human. It\u2019s also intended to make you a role model for those around you. Page 574 Partial Completeness Most of us have resigned ourselves to a partial completeness , just as Chad Fowler did before losing more than 100 pounds. Partial completeness can take many forms, usually in the form of self-talk like: \u201cI\u2019m just not [thin, fast, strong, muscular, etc.]. That\u2019s the way it is.\u201d \u201cXYZ doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not that important.\u201d These are said or thought for many reasons. Oftentimes, they\u2019re used to excuse something on the outside that people believe they can\u2019t change. The beauty is, almost all of it can be changed. More important, the reason to change the physical isn\u2019t physical at all. In 2007, I was interviewed for the monthly newsletter of Eben Pagan, who runs a $30 million per year relationship-advice empire. One of his first questions was: \u201cWhat\u2019s the fastest way for someone to improve their inner game?\u201d To which I responded: \u201cImprove your outer game.\u201d If you want to be more confident or effective, rather than relying on easily- defeated positive thinking and mental gymnastics, learn to run faster, lift more than your peers, or lose those last ten pounds. It\u2019s measurable, it\u2019s clear, you can\u2019t lie to yourself. It therefore works. Recall Richard Branson\u2019s answer to the question \u201cHow do you become more productive?\u201d: work out. The Cartesian separation of mind and body is false. They\u2019re reciprocal. Start with the precision of changing physical reality and a domino effect will often take care of the internal. Becoming Complete Your body is almost always within your control. This is rare in life, perhaps unique. Simply focusing on some measurable element of your physical nature can prevent you from becoming a \u201cDow Joneser,\u201d someone whose self-worth is dependent on things largely outside of their control. Job not going well? Company having issues? Some idiot making life difficult? Page 575 If you add ten laps to your swimming, or if you cut five seconds off your best mile time, it can still be a great week. Controlling your body puts you in life\u2019s driver\u2019s seat.

At age 45, George Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer, age 26, to become heavyweight boxing champion of the world, reclaiming the title he\u2019d lost to Muhammad Ali two decades earlier.

The critical few in this section are ordered from least to most expensive, 1 and I\u2019ve put asterisks (***) next to the tests that yielded the most actionable results for me and other test subjects in the book. Of the blood tests, SpectraCell was, across the board, the most immediately impactful for the case studies I supervised. It\u2019s here . Use these tests as a starting point, beginning with the least expensive and adding only when needed or as budget allows. More sophisticated tests can be prescribed by a physician if the basics show abnormalities. Not sure what CBC or TSH is? In the beginning, I wasn\u2019t either, but you can learn any of them in 60 seconds. For that matter, you could learn all of them in 60 minutes. Use www.fourhourbody.com/bloodtests to look up unfamiliar blood test terms, or to get a better understanding of your own results. Here are a few guidelines to prevent you from going Woody Allen neurotic: 1. If you can\u2019t act on it or enjoy it, don\u2019t bother testing it. No one needs to learn they\u2019re predisposed to a disease they can do nothing to fix. Focus on actionable items and ignore the rest. 2. Take the same tests at the same time. Timing matters \u2026 a lot. To compare before and after results for a given test, aim for the same time of day, same day of the week, and (if female) same point in your menstrual cycle. Testosterone levels, as just one example, can easily change more than 10% from 8 A.M . to 12 noon. 3. If you get an alarming result, repeat the test before making big changes. One acquaintance removed almost every food from his diet\u2014\u201cI\u2019m allergic to them all!\u201d\u2014without realizing that food allergy testing is notoriously error-prone. If you get an alarming result, repeat the test. If you have the budget, consider using a different lab or, better still, sending two identical samples to the same lab under different names. I did the latter with several tests, including 23andMe, to ensure the results were consistent. 23andMe passed, but many others did not. Get a second opinion before doing anything drastic. Page 579 I owe special thanks to Dr. Justin Mager for helping me navigate the world of testing. THE MENU Insurance will often cover the first one or two comprehensive tests you have performed, and I encourage you to speak with your doctor about this option. I prefer to keep my testing activities (and results) out of insurance files and usually pay with a credit card. For this reason, I\u2019ve listed the cash costs for each test.

This seems reflective of bad testing processes, or a bad test in general, and the questionable results seem common across most labs. This is also true for \u201cgut permeability\u201d tests. There are, however, two main takeaways from my food allergy experiments and polling: most problems are caused by gluten, which you shouldn\u2019t be eating much of in the first place; and you can create food allergies if you eat the same foods and same protein sources all the time.

The more experiments you make the better. \u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson It doesn\u2019t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn\u2019t matter how smart you are. If it doesn\u2019t agree with experiment, it\u2019s wrong. \u2014Richard Feynman This chapter was written by Dr. Seth Roberts, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California\u2013Berkeley and professor of psychology at Tsinghua University. His work has appeared in the New York Times Magazine and The Scientist , and he is on the editorial board of the journal Nutrition. I started self-experimentation when I was a grad student. I was studying experimental psychology; self-experimentation was a way to learn how to do experiments. One of my first self-experiments was about acne. My dermatologist had prescribed tetracycline, an antibiotic. Just for practice, I did an experiment to measure its effect. I varied the dosage of tetracycline\u2014the number of pills per day\u2014and counted the number of pimples on my face each morning. First I compared six pills per day (a high dose) and four pills per day (the prescribed dose). Somewhat to my surprise, they produced the same number of pimples. I tried other dosages. Eventually I tried zero pills per day. To my shock, zero pills per day produced the same number of pimples as four or six pills per day. The conclusion was unavoidable: the drug had no effect. (Many years later, research articles about antibiotic-resistant acne began to appear.) Tetracycline is a prescription drug; it\u2019s not completely safe. I\u2019d been taking it for months. My dermatologist had also prescribed benzoyl peroxide, which comes in a cream. When my self-experimentation started, I believed that tetracycline was powerful and benzoyl peroxide weak, so I rarely used the cream. One day I ran low on tetracycline. Better use the cream, I thought. For the first time, I used the cream regularly. Again I was shocked: it worked well. Two days after I started using it, the number of pimples clearly went down. When I stopped the cream, two days later the number of pimples rose. When I restarted the cream, the number of pimples went down again. My data left no doubt that (a) tetracycline didn\u2019t work and (b) benzoyl peroxide did work\u2014the opposite of my original beliefs. My dermatologist thought both worked. He\u2019d seen hundreds of acne patients and had probably read Page 587 hundreds of articles about acne. Yet in a few months I\u2019d learned"

    "text": "something important he didn\u2019t know. This wasn\u2019t the usual line about self-experimentation. Read any book about it, such as Lawrence Altman\u2019s Who Goes First? The Story of Self-Experimentation in Medicine , and you will come away thinking that self-experimentation is done by selfless doctors to test new and dangerous treatments. My experience was different. I wasn\u2019t a doctor. I wasn\u2019t trying to help someone else. I didn\u2019t test a dangerous new treatment. Unlike the better-known sort of self-experimentation, which usually confirms what the experimenter believes, my self-experiments had shown I was wrong. From my acne research I learned that self-experimentation can be used by non-experts to (a) see if the experts are right and (b) learn something they don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t realized such things were possible. The next problem I tried to solve this way was early awakening. For years, starting in my twenties, I woke up early in the morning, such as 4 A.M ., still tired but unable to go back to sleep. Only a few dreary hours later would I be able to fall back asleep. This happened about half of all mornings. It showed no sign of going away. I didn\u2019t want to take a pill for the rest of my life\u2014not that there are any good pills for this\u2014so I didn\u2019t bother seeing a doctor. The only hope for a good solution, as far as I could tell, was self-experimentation. So I did two things: 1. I recorded a few details about my sleep. The main one was whether I fell back asleep after getting up. How often this happened was my measure of the severity of the problem. In the beginning, I couldn\u2019t fall back asleep about half of all mornings. 2. I tested possible solutions. The first thing I tried was aerobic exercise. It didn\u2019t help. Early awakening was just as common after a day with exercise as after a day without exercise. I tried eating cheese in the evening. It didn\u2019t help. I tried several more possible remedies. None helped. After several years, I ran out of things to try. All my ideas about what might help had proved wrong. Yet I managed to make progress. For unrelated reasons, I changed my breakfast from oatmeal to fruit. A few days later, I started waking up too early every morning instead of half the time. The problem was now much worse. This had never happened before. I recorded the breakfast change on the same piece of Page 588 paper I used to keep track of my sleep, so the correlation was easy to see. To make sure the correlation reflected causality, I went back and forth between fruit and oatmeal. The results showed it was cause and effect. Fruit for breakfast caused more early awakening than oatmeal for breakfast. After ten years when nothing I\u2019d done had made a difference, this was a big step forward. I eventually figured out that any breakfast made early awakening more likely. A long experiment confirmed this. The best breakfast was no breakfast. I was less surprised than you might think. I knew that in a wide range of animals, including rats, a laboratory result called anticipatory activity is well established. If you feed a rat every day at the same time, it will become active about three hours earlier. If you feed it at noon, it will become active about 9 A.M . I had been eating breakfast at about 7 A.M . and waking up about 4 A.M . I had essentially found that humans were like other animals in this regard. Not eating breakfast reduced early awakening but didn\u2019t eliminate it. In the following years, self-experimentation taught me more about what caused it. By accident, I found that standing helped. If I stood more than eight hours in a day, I slept better that night. That wasn\u2019t practical\u2014after trying to stand that much for several years, I gave up\u2014but the realization helped me make another accidental discovery 10 years later: standing on one leg to exhaustion helps. If I do this four times (left leg twice, right leg twice) during a day, even in the morning, I sleep much better that night. More recently, I\u2019ve found that animal fat makes"

    "text": "me sleep better. Both effects are dose-dependent. I can get great sleep if I stand enough and great sleep if I eat enough animal fat. How much animal fat is \u201cenough\u201d? I\u2019ve just started trying to figure this out using pig fat, which I consume in a cut called pork belly (the part of the pig used for bacon). I found that 150 grams of pork belly had a little effect; 250 grams of pork belly had a much clearer effect. The effect seems to get larger with more pork belly (e.g., 350 grams). Because pork belly may be more than 90% fat by calories (there is great variation from one piece to the next), it\u2019s a lot of calories of fat to get the maximum possible effect. I need to burn a lot of calories per day to make that many calories easy to eat, but it\u2019s in some respects more convenient than standing on one foot. Acne and sleep were my first self-experimental topics. Later I studied mood, weight control, and the effects of omega-3 on brain function. I learned that self- experimentation has three uses: Page 589 1. To test ideas. I tested the idea that tetracycline helps acne. I tested ideas about how to sleep better. And I\u2019ve tested ideas derived from surprises. A few years ago, while trying to put on my shoes standing up, I realized my balance was much better than usual. I\u2019d been putting on my shoes standing up for more than a year; that morning it was much easier than usual. The previous evening I\u2019d swallowed six flaxseed-oil capsules. I did self-experiments to test the idea that flaxseed oil improves balance. (It did.) 2. To generate new ideas. By its nature, self-experimentation involves making sharp changes in your life: you don\u2019t do X for several weeks, then you do X for several weeks. This, plus the fact that we monitor ourselves in a hundred ways, makes it easy for self-experimentation to reveal unexpected side effects. This has happened to me five times. Moreover, daily measurements\u2014of acne, sleep, or anything else\u2014supply a baseline that makes it even easier to see unexpected changes. 3. To develop ideas. That is, to determine the best way to use a discovery and to learn about the underlying mechanism. After I found that flaxseed oil improved balance, I used self-experimentation to figure out the best dose (three to four tablespoons per day). One complaint about self-experimentation is that you\u2019re not \u201cblind.\u201d Maybe the treatment works because you expect it to work. A placebo effect. I have never seen a case where this appeared to have happened. When treatment 10 helps after treatments 1 through 9 have failed to help (my usual experience), it\u2019s unlikely to be a placebo effect. Accidental discoveries cannot be placebo effects. My experience has shown that improve-your-life self-experimentation is remarkably powerful. I wasn\u2019t an expert in anything I studied\u2014I\u2019m not a sleep expert, for example\u2014but I repeatedly found useful cause-and-effect relationships (breakfast causes early awakening, flaxseed oil improves balance, etc.) that the experts had missed. This isn\u2019t supposed to happen, of course, but it made a lot of sense. My self-experimentation had three big advantages over conventional research done by experts: 1. More power. Self-experiments are far better at determining causality (does X cause Y?) than conventional experiments. Obviously they\u2019re much faster and cheaper. If I have an idea about how to sleep better, I can test it on myself in a few weeks for free. Conventional sleep experiments take a year or more (getting funding takes time) and cost thousands of dollars. A less obvious advantage of Page 590 self-experimentation is that more wisdom is acquired. We learn from our mistakes. Fast self-experimentation means you make more mistakes. One lesson I learned stands out: Always do the minimum\u2014 the simplest, easiest experiment that will make progress. Few professional scientists seem to know this. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, self-experimentation is much more sensitive to unexpected side effects. 2. Stone Age\u2013like"

    "text": "treatments are easy to test. I repeatedly found that simple environmental changes, such as avoiding breakfast and standing more, had big and surprising benefits. In each case, the change I\u2019d made resembled a return to Stone Age life, when no one ate breakfast and everyone stood a lot. There are plenty of reasons to think that many common health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer, are caused by differences between modern life and Stone Age life. Modern life and Stone Age life differ in many ways, of course; the fraction of differences that influence our health is probably low. If so, to find aspects of Stone Age life that matter, you have to do many tests. Self- experiments, fast and cheap, can do this; conventional experiments, slow and expensive, cannot. In addition, conventional research is slanted toward treatments that can make money for someone. Because conventional research is expensive, funding is needed. Drug companies will fund research about drugs, so lots of conventional research involves drugs. Elements of Stone Age life (such as no breakfast) are cheap and widely available. No company will fund research about their effectiveness. 3. Better motivation. I studied my sleep for 10 years before making clear progress. That sort of persistence never happens in conventional health research. The reason is a difference in motivation. Part of the difference is how much the researcher cares about finding solutions. When you study your own problem (e.g., acne), you care more about finding a solution than others are likely to care. Acne researchers rarely have acne. And part of the motivation difference is the importance of goals other than solving the problem. When I studied my sleep, my only goal was to sleep better. Professional scientists have other goals, which are enormously constraining. One set of prison bars involves employment and research funding. To keep their jobs (e.g., get tenure, get promoted, get jobs for their students, and get grants), professional scientists must publish several research papers per year. Research that can\u2019t provide this is undoable. Another set of prison bars involves status. Professional scientists derive most of their status from their job. When they have a choice, they try to enhance or protect their status. Some sorts of Page 591 research have more status than others. Large grants have more status than small grants, so professional scientists prefer expensive research to cheap research. High-tech has more status than low-tech, so they prefer high-tech. As Thorstein Veblen emphasized in The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), useless research has higher status than useful research. Doing useless work, Veblen said, shows that you are higher-status than those who must do useful work. So researchers prefer useless research, thus the term \u201civory tower.\u201d Fear of loss of job, grant, or status also makes it hard for professional scientists to propose radical new ideas. Self-experimenters, trying to solve their own problem on their own time, are not trapped like this. Acne illustrates the problem. The dermatological party line is that diet doesn\u2019t cause acne. According to a website of the American Academy of Dermatology, \u201cextensive scientific studies\u201d show it\u2019s a \u201cmyth\u201d that \u201cacne is caused by diet.\u201d According to \u201cguidelines for care\u201d for dermatologists published in 2007, \u201cdietary restriction (either specific foods or food classes) has not been demonstrated to be of benefit in the treatment of acne.\u201d In fact, there is overwhelming evidence linking diet and acne. Starting in the 1970s, a Connecticut doctor named William Danby collected evidence connecting dairy consumption and acne; it is telling that Danby wasn\u2019t a professional scientist. When his patients gave up dairy, it often helped. In 2002, six scientists (none a dermatologist) published a paper with the Weston Price\u2013like conclusion that two isolated groups of people (Kitava Islanders and Ache hunter-gatherers) had"

    "text": "no acne at all. They had examined more than 1,000 subjects over the age of 10 and found no acne. When people in these groups left their communities and ate differently, they did get acne. These observations suggest that a lot of acne\u2014 maybe all of it\u2014can be cured and prevented by diet. Why is the official line so wrong? Because the painstaking research needed to show the many ways diet causes acne is the sort of research that professional researchers can\u2019t do and don\u2019t want to do. They can\u2019t do it because the research would be hard to fund (no one makes money when patients avoid dairy) and because the trial and error required would take too long per publication. They don\u2019t want to do it because it would be low-tech, low-cost, and very useful\u2014and therefore low-status. While research doctors in other specialties study high-tech expensive treatments, they would be doing low-cost studies of what happens when you avoid certain foods. Humiliating. Colleagues in other specialties might make fun of them. To justify their avoidance of embarrassment, the whole profession tells the rest of us, based on \u201cextensive scientific studies,\u201d that black is white. Self-experimentation allows acne sufferers to ignore the strange claims Page 592 of dermatologists, not to mention their dangerous drugs (such as Accutane). Persons with acne can simply change their diets until they figure out what foods cause the problem. Gregor Mendel was a monk. He was under no pressure to publish; he could say whatever he wanted about horticulture without fear for his job. Charles Darwin was wealthy. He had no job to lose. He could write On the Origin of Species very slowly. Alfred Wegener, who proposed continental drift, was a meteorologist. Geology was a hobby of his. Because they had total freedom and plenty of time, and professional biologists and geologists did not (just as now), Mendel, Darwin, and Wegener were able to use the accumulated knowledge of their time better than the professionals. The accumulated knowledge of our time is more accessible than ever before. Self-experimenters, with total freedom, plenty of time, and easy access to empirical tests, are in a great position to take advantage of it.

Scientists seem to change their minds every six months. Eggs and butter will kill you, so you turn to margarine and turkey bacon. Now margarine will kill you and one egg a day is okay?! It almost seems better to opt out completely and live in ignorance. Page 595 Fortunately, science isn\u2019t arbitrary. In fact, you just need to learn a few simple concepts to separate the truth (or probable truth) from complete fiction. Most research is presented to the public through media or propagandists with agendas. Since diet is most often hijacked for selling newspapers and ideologies, we\u2019ll use almost -believable diet nonsense to develop our BS meter. To create the most perfect you, you need to know which science to follow and which \u201cscience\u201d to ignore. After reading the next eight pages, you will know more about research studies than the average MD. The Big Five The Big Five are important to understand, as they are the tools most often used to exaggerate and brainwash. They are also critical to grasp so you don\u2019t trick yourself or waste time with false leads as a self-experimenter. I\u2019ve phrased each concept as a question you should ask yourself when looking at diet advice or the \u201clatest research.\u201d 1. IS A RELATIVE CHANGE (LIKE PERCENTAGES) BEING USED TO CONVINCE? This concept is best illustrated with two potential news headlines. \u201cS TUDIES S HOW P EOPLE W HO A VOID S ATURATED F AT L IVE L ONGER \u201d Should you start avoiding saturated fat? First, find out exactly what \u201clonger\u201d means. Based on available data, it turns out that reducing your saturated fat intake to 10% of daily calories for your entire adult life would add only 3\u201330 days to your lifespan. Considering this, is the trouble worth it if a rib-eye is one of your pleasures in life? Probably not. \u201cP EOPLE W HO D RINK C OFFEE L OSE 20% M ORE F AT T HAN T HOSE W HO D ON\u2019T \u201d Should you start drinking coffee? Leaving aside the question of whether or not this is an observational study (discussed next), it\u2019s worth looking at that mighty impressive 20%. Relative increases or decreases, most often expressed as percentages, can be misleading. Relative isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s critical to ask what the absolute increase or decrease Page 596 was\u2014in this case, how many pounds of fat did both groups actually lose, and over what period of time? In most cases, percentages are used in media and sales brochures to mask the fact that changes were minuscule. If it were 0.25 pounds lost for the control group and 0.30 pounds (20% more) for the coffee group over eight weeks at three cups per day, is picking up the coffee habit worth the side effects of high-dose caffeine? Nope. Distrust percentages in isolation. 2. IS THIS AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY CLAIMING TO SHOW CAUSE AND EFFECT? This is the mother lode. If you learn just one concept in this chapter, learn this one. It\u2019s the cardinal sin. Observational studies, 3 also referred to as uncontrolled experiments, look at different groups or populations outside the lab and compare the occurrence of specific phenomena, usually diseases."

Observational studies can only show correlation: A and B both exist at the same time in one group. They cannot show cause and effect. 4 In contrast, randomized and controlled experiments control variables and can therefore show cause and effect (causation): A causes B to happen. The satirical religion Pastafarianism purposely confuses correlation and causation: With a decrease in the number of pirates, there has been an increase in global warming over the same period . Therefore, global warming is caused by a lack of pirates. Even more compelling: Somalia has the highest number of Pirates AND the lowest Carbon emissions of any country. Coincidence? Drawing unwarranted cause-and-effect conclusions from observational studies is the bread-and-butter of media and cause- or financially-driven scientists blind Page 597 to their own lack of ethics. Don\u2019t fall for Pastafarianism in science. It is critical not to take advice based purely on observational studies.

Observation of one group of women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) showed lower heart disease, and media and HRT proponents were fast to promote this sound-bite conclusion: HRT reduces heart disease! Sadly, randomized and controlled trials (RCT) later showed no protective effects, and even a slight increase of risk, for heart disease among those using HRT. How was this possible? It turns out that the observational studies didn\u2019t sufficiently account for different socioeconomic statuses between groups, or for the influence of doctors selecting women for HRT who were less predisposed to heart disease to begin with. The latter is an example of how failing to randomly assign subjects to groups (randomization) leaves observational studies open to bias from experimenters. The 2004 hindsight commentary stated, rightly: The differing results between observational studies and RCT [randomized and controlled trials] in the association between HRT and CHD throw this idea [that well-conducted observational studies can produce similar estimates of treatment effects as RCT] into question and may signify the death of observational epidemiology. Observational studies are valuable for developing hypotheses (educated guesses that can then be tested in controlled settings) but they cannot and should not be used to show cause and effect. To do so is both irresponsible and potentially dangerous. 3. DOES THIS STUDY DEPEND ON SELF-REPORTING OR SURVEYS? In 1980, scientists at an isolated research station in Antarctica had test subjects weigh and record all of the food they consumed. Once a week, the subjects were asked to recall what they had eaten the day before (food, keep in mind, they had weighed and recorded in their notebooks). Despite all the attention to logging meals, the men still underestimated their intake by 20\u201330%. Granted, these might have been blizzard-blind men. Hardly normal Page 598 circumstances. Let\u2019s look at how the real professionals do it. The Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) was a massive $415-million project conducted under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and involving nearly 49,000 women. It was designed to investigate a number of health issues, including the effect of low-fat diets on cancer, over an eight-year period. It was a large-scale intervention study, often viewed by media as the gold standard in nutrition research. Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Association went so far as to call the WHI \u201cthe Rolls-Royce of studies.\u201d The New York Times announced the results in 2006 with a headline that was crystal clear: \u201cL OW"

Let\u2019s look to Michael Pollan for a peek under the hood at one of the most common weaknesses of nutritional studies: self- reporting. To try to fill out the food-frequency questionnaire used by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, as I recently did, is to realize just how shaky the data on which such trials rely really are.\u2026 It asked me to think back over the past three months to recall whether when I ate okra, squash or yams, were they fried, and if so, were they fried in stick margarine, tub margarine, butter, \u201cshortening\u201d (in which category they inexplicably lump together hydrogenated vegetable oil and lard), olive or canola oil or nonstick spray? I honestly didn\u2019t remember, and in the case of any okra eaten in a restaurant, even a hypnotist could not get out of me what sort of fat it was fried in.\u2026 This is the sort of data on which the largest questions of diet and health are being decided in America today. Other WHI questions include: When you ate chicken or turkey, how often did you eat the skin? Did you usually choose light meat, dark meat, or both? In the last three months, how many times have you eaten a half-cup serving of broccoli? 5 Page 599 How would you do? Think you can pull off recollection within 20% of reality? Let\u2019s test the last 24 hours. Do this: estimate the number of calories you ate and drank yesterday, without using any references, as well as the fat calories you consumed. Then eat the same meals and snacks, but weigh it all in grams on a portable kitchen scale. Measure drinks using a measuring cup. Use www.nutritiondata.com to determine the 100-gram caloric value of each food and do the math. 6 Unless you are a professional athlete and can distinguish between a 150-gram serving of steak and a 200-gram serving, the difference between your self- reporting and your weighing analysis will shock you. Combine that misreporting across 49,000 people and you can imagine the rather Picasso-like picture it creates. Granted, self-reported data can be useful, especially when recording in real time (i.e., recording something as it happens). This has become easier with technology that takes memory out of the equation, such as DailyBurn\u2019s FoodScanner iPhone application and the Withings wifi scale. 7 To the greatest extent possible, avoid studies that depend on after-the-fact self- reporting. Trust your own data. Just record it when things happen. 4. IS THIS DIET STUDY CLAIMING A CONTROL GROUP? Desirable as it may be, it is almost impossible to change just one macronutrient variable (protein, carbohydrate, fat) in a diet study. It is therefore almost impossible to create a control group. If a researcher makes such a claim and vilifies a single macronutrient, your skeptical spider sense should tingle. Let\u2019s suppose that someone claims that a study on the effects of a low-fat diet proves it\u2019s healthier than a higher-fat diet. There is a control group. First things first: if you decrease fat or cholesterol in a whole-food diet, you\u2019ll be removing fat and protein, which means you must add carbohydrate to make the diets equal in calories. If you don\u2019t, you have unequal calories as another variable. If you make this caloric correction by adding carbohydrate elsewhere, now you face a conundrum: not only are you comparing a higher-fat and a lower-fat diet, but you\u2019re simultaneously comparing a higher-protein and a lower-protein diet, as well as a higher-carb and a lower-carb diet. How can we know which is responsible for what? We can\u2019t. Page 600 Self-experimentation actually offers an unexpected advantage here. The \u201ccontrol\u201d is everything you\u2019ve tried up to a certain point that hasn\u2019t produced a desired effect. Isolating one variable is often less important than the sum impact of a group of changes. In other words, has your bodyfat percentage gone up or down in the last"

In an ideal (but unattractive) test, you would go back to A and see if bodyfat then moves in the other direction. Then repeat the switch again. This would minimize the possibility that the first change in bodyfat just happened to coincide with the change in diet to B. Alas, this switching would also maximize your likelihood of going insane. If something seems to be working, just stick with it. 5. DO THE FUNDERS OF THE STUDY HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN A CERTAIN OUTCOME? Beware of unholy unions between scientists and funding sources. Fred Stare, founder and chair of the Nutrition Department at Harvard University, obtained a $1,026,000 grant from General Foods in 1960. These manufacturers of the sugar-rich Post cereals, Kool-Aid, and the Tang breakfast drink would be subsidizing the \u201cexpansion of the School\u2019s Nutrition Research Laboratories.\u201d In the decade that followed, Stare became the most public and reputable defender of sugar and modern food additives, all the while receiving funding from Coca-Cola and the National Soft Drinks Association, among others. Does this prove malfeasance? No. Does it show that funding, support that can be discontinued, often comes from those most likely to benefit? Yes. People respond to incentives. Simple due diligence: Peruse the required \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d section in studies or reviews related to diet and look for \u201cconsulting fees.\u201d If McCorporation or the XYZ Lobby decides it\u2019s too obvious to fund studies directly, hiring researchers as consultants can be an indirect means to the same end. James Hill of the University of Colorado, as one example, is well known for attempting to discredit the relationship between obesity and higher insulin levels caused by sugar consumption. In his stated conflicts of interest, you will see that he has received consulting fees from Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, and Mars Corporation (makers of Snickers, M&Ms, and Mars Bars). Does this make him guilty of skewing data to serve corporate interests? No. But it should make you look closely at the studies themselves before accepting the headlines and making behavioral changes in your life. Page 601 The Goal of this Chapter vs. the Goal of this Book Understanding how to act under conditions of incomplete information is the highest and most urgent human pursuit. \u2014Nassim Taleb, The Black Swan Are the experiments in this book bulletproof? Far from it. All studies are flawed in some respect, often for legitimate cost or ethical considerations. I use myself as a single subject, and (with a few exceptions) I neither randomize nor create a control. Some scientists will, no doubt, have a field day picking these self-experiments apart. This doesn\u2019t bother me, and it shouldn\u2019t bother you. The goal of this chapter is simple: since we often use published research as a starting point for self-experimentation, we want to ensure that we don\u2019t take false leads from tricksters or misinformed journalists with good intentions. Understanding the Big Five questions and the hallmarks of sensationalism puts you in a rare group: those who can depend on themselves, not the media, for nutritional guidance. This opens doors that we can then crowbar and leverage for incredible effect. My goal for the book is not, first and foremost, to identify the single variables that produce target changes. That is often the goal of clinical research for publication, but experimentation for self-improvement is a different beast. It may be that alpha-lipoic acid does nothing in a given fat-loss cocktail; perhaps it\u2019s the angle of an exercise and not the load that triggers muscular gain; or it could be that spinach has none of the effects I predict, but other foods in the prescribed meal do. The exact mechanism doesn\u2019t much matter if we get the effects we want \u2026 without side effects. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously wrote that \u201cjustice too long delayed"

    "text": "is justice denied.\u201d In the world of self-experimentation, where the outcomes are of personal importance, results too long delayed are results denied. This doesn\u2019t mean being haphazard. It\u2019s more than possible to tinker without hurting yourself. It means, however, that waiting for perfect conditions often means waiting forever. In the world I live in, people want to lose fat or improve sexual performance now, not in five or ten years. Page 602 Let the journals catch up later\u2014you don\u2019t have to wait. P-Value: One Number to Understand Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for effective citizenship as the ability to read and write. \u2014H. G. Wells, who created national hysteria with his radio adaptation of his science fiction book The War of the Worlds British MD and quack buster Ben Goldacre, contributor of the next chapter , is well known for illustrating how people can be fooled by randomness. He uses the following example: If you go to a cocktail party, what\u2019s the likelihood that two people in a group of 23 will share the same birthday? One in 100? One in 50? In fact, it\u2019s one in two. Fifty percent. To become better at spotting randomness for what it is, it\u2019s important to understand the concept of \u201cp-value,\u201d which you\u2019ll see in all good research studies. It answers the question: how confident are we that this result wasn\u2019t due to random chance? To demonstrate (or imply) cause-and-effect, the gold standard for studies is a p-value of less than 0.05 (p < 0.05), which means a less than 5% likelihood that the result can be attributed to chance. A p-value of less than 0.05 is also what most scientists mean when they say something is \u201cstatistically significant.\u201d An example makes this easy to understand. Let\u2019s say you are a professional coin flipper, but you\u2019re unethical. In hopes of dominating the coin-flipping gambling circuit, you\u2019ve engineered a quarter that should come up heads more often than a normal quarter. To test it, you flip it and a normal quarter 100 times, and the results seem clear: the \u201cnormal\u201d quarter came up heads 50 times, and your designer quarter came up heads 60 times! Should you take out a second mortgage and head to Vegas? Page 603 The above sample size estimation tool, created by the web design and analytics firm WebShare, says: probably not, if you want to keep the house. If we look at 20% improvement (60 flips vs. 50 flips = 10 more flips) at the top and scan down to see how many coin flips you\u2019d need per coin to be 95% confident in your results (p = 0.05), you\u2019d need 453 flips. In other words, you better make sure that 20% holds up with at least 453 flips with each coin. In this case, 10 extra flips out of 100 doesn\u2019t prove cause-and- effect at all. Three points to remember about p-values and \u201cstatistical significance\u201d: \u2022 Just because something seems miraculous doesn\u2019t mean it is. People are fooled by randomness all the time, as in the birthday example. \u2022 The larger the difference between groups, the smaller the groups can be. Critics of small trials or self-experimentation often miss this. If something appears to produce a 300% change, you don\u2019t need that many people to show significance, assuming you\u2019re controlling variables. \u2022 It is not kosher to combine p-values from multiple experiments to make something more or less believable. That\u2019s another trick of bad scientists and mistake of uninformed journalists. TOOLS AND TRICKS The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb ( www.fourhourbody.com/blackswan ) Taleb, also author of the bestseller Fooled by Randomness, is the reigning king when it comes to explaining how we fool ourselves and how we can limit the damage.

Page 606 SPOTTING BAD SCIENCE 102 So You Have a Pill \u2026 This chapter was written by Dr. Ben Goldacre, who has written the weekly \u201cBad Science\u201d column in the Guardian since 2003 and is a recipient of the Royal Statistical Society\u2019s Award for Statistical Excellence in Journalism. He is a medical doctor who, among other things, specializes in unpacking sketchy scientific claims made by scaremongering journalists, questionable government reports, evil pharmaceutical corporations, PR companies, and quacks. What I\u2019m about to tell you is what I teach medical students and doctors\u2014here and there\u2014in a lecture I rather childishly call \u2018Drug Company Bullshit\u2019. It is, in turn, what I was taught at medical school, 1 and I think the easiest way to understand the issue is to put yourself in the shoes of a big pharma researcher. You have a pill. It\u2019s OK, maybe not that brilliant, but a lot of money is riding on it. You need a positive result, but your audience aren\u2019t homeopaths, journalists or the public: they are doctors and academics, so they have been trained in spotting the obvious tricks, like \u2018no blinding\u2019, or \u2018inadequate randomisation\u2019. Your sleights of hand will have to be much more elegant, much more subtle, but every bit as powerful. What can you do? Well, firstly, you could study it in winners. Different people respond differently to drugs: old people on lots of medications are often no-hopers, whereas younger people with just one problem are more likely to show an improvement. So only study your drug in the latter group. This will make your research much less applicable to the actual people that doctors are prescribing for, but hopefully they won\u2019t notice. This is so commonplace it is hardly worth giving an example. Next up, you could compare your drug against a useless control. Many people would argue, for example, that you should never compare your drug against placebo, because it proves nothing of clinical value: in the real world, nobody cares if your drug is better than a sugar pill; they only care if it is better than the best currently available treatment. But you\u2019ve already spent hundreds of millions of dollars bringing your drug to market, so stuff that: do lots of placebo- controlled trials and make a big fuss about them, because they practically guarantee some positive data. Again, this is universal, because almost all drugs Page 607 will be compared against placebo at some stage in their lives, and \u2018drug reps\u2019\u2014 the people employed by big pharma to bamboozle doctors (many simply refuse to see them)\u2014love the unambiguous positivity of the graphs these studies can produce. Then things get more interesting. If you do have to compare your drug with one produced by a competitor\u2014to save face, or because a regulator demands it \u2014you could try a sneaky underhand trick: use an inadequate dose of the competing drug, so that patients on it don\u2019t do very well; or give a very high"

    "text": "dose of the competing drug, so that patients experience lots of side- effects; or give the competing drug in the wrong way (perhaps orally when it should be intravenous, and hope most readers don\u2019t notice); or you could increase the dose of the competing drug much too quickly, so that the patients taking it get worse side-effects. Your drug will shine by comparison. You might think no such thing could ever happen. If you follow the references in the back, you will find studies where patients were given really rather high doses of old-fashioned antipsychotic medication (which made the new-generation drugs look as if they were better in terms of side-effects), and studies with doses of SSRI antidepressants which some might consider unusual, to name just a couple of examples. I know. It\u2019s slightly incredible. Of course, another trick you could pull with side-effects is simply not to ask about them; or rather\u2014since you have to be sneaky in this field\u2014you could be careful about how you ask. Here is an example. SSRI antidepressant drugs cause sexual side-effects fairly commonly, including anorgasmia. We should be clear (and I\u2019m trying to phrase this as neutrally as possible): I really enjoy the sensation of orgasm. It\u2019s important to me, and everything I experience in the world tells me that this sensation is important to other people, too. Wars have been fought, essentially, for the sensation of orgasm. There are evolutionary psychologists who would try to persuade you that the entirety of human culture and language is driven, in large part, by the pursuit of the sensation of orgasm. Losing it seems like an important side-effect to ask about. And yet, various studies have shown that the reported prevalence of anorgasmia in patients taking SSRI drugs varies between 2 per cent and 73 per cent, depending primarily on how you ask: a casual, open-ended question about side-effects, for example, or a careful and detailed enquiry. One 3,000-subject review on SSRIs simply did not list any sexual side-effects on its twenty-three- item side-effect table. Twenty-three other things were more important, according to the researchers, than losing the sensation of orgasm. I have read them. They are not. Page 608 But back to the main outcomes. And here is a good trick: instead of a real- world outcome, like death or pain, you could always use a \u2018surrogate outcome\u2019, which is easier to attain. If your drug is supposed to reduce cholesterol and so prevent cardiac deaths, for example, don\u2019t measure cardiac deaths; measure reduced cholesterol instead. That\u2019s much easier to achieve than a reduction in cardiac deaths, and the trial will be cheaper and quicker to do, so your result will be cheaper and more positive. Result! Now you\u2019ve done your trial, and despite your best efforts things have come out negative. What can you do? Well, if your trial has been good overall, but has thrown out a few negative results, you could try an old trick: don\u2019t draw attention to the disappointing data by putting it on a graph. Mention it briefly in the text, and ignore it when drawing your conclusions. (I\u2019m so good at this I scare myself. Comes from reading too many rubbish trials.) If your results are completely negative, don\u2019t publish them at all, or publish them only after a long delay. This is exactly what the drug companies did with the data on SSRI antidepressants: they hid the data suggesting they might be dangerous, and they buried the data showing them to perform no better than placebo. If you\u2019re really clever and have money to burn, then after you get disappointing data, you could do some more trials with the same protocol in the hope that they will be positive. Then try to bundle all the data up together, so that your negative data is swallowed up by some mediocre positive results. Or you could get really serious and start to manipulate the statistics. For two pages only, this will now get quite nerdy. Here are the classic tricks to play in your statistical"

Throw all your data into a spreadsheet programme and report\u2014as significant\u2014any relationship between anything and everything if it helps your case. If you measure enough, some things are bound to be positive just by sheer luck. Play with the baseline Sometimes, when you start a trial, quite by chance the treatment group is already doing better than the placebo group. If so, then leave it like that. If, on the other hand, the placebo group is already doing better than the treatment group at the start, then adjust for the baseline in your analysis. Ignore dropouts Page 609 People who drop out of trials are statistically much more likely to have done badly, and much more likely to have had side- effects. They will only make your drug look bad. So ignore them, make no attempt to chase them up, do not include them in your final analysis. Clean up the data Look at your graphs. There will be some anomalous \u2018outliers\u2019, or points which lie a long way from the others. If they are making your drug look bad, just delete them. But if they are helping your drug look good, even if they seem to be spurious results, leave them in. \u2018The best of five \u2026 no \u2026 seven \u2026 no \u2026 nine!\u2019 If the difference between your drug and placebo becomes significant four and a half months into a six-month trial, stop the trial immediately and start writing up the results: things might get less impressive if you carry on. Alternatively, if at six months the results are \u2018nearly significant\u2019, extend the trial by another three months. Torture the data If your results are bad, ask the computer to go back and see if any particular subgroups behaved differently. You might find that your drug works very well in Chinese women aged fifty-two to sixty-one. \u2018Torture the data and it will confess to anything\u2019, as they say at Guantanamo Bay. Try every button on the computer If you\u2019re really desperate, and analysing your data the way you planned does not give you the result you wanted, just run the figures through a wide selection of other statistical tests, even if they are entirely inappropriate, at random. And when you\u2019re finished, the most important thing, of course, is to publish wisely. If you have a good trial, publish it in the biggest journal you can possibly manage. If you have a positive trial, but it was a completely unfair test, which will be obvious to everyone, then put it in an obscure journal (published, written and edited entirely by the industry). Remember, the tricks we have just described hide nothing, and will be obvious to anyone who reads your paper, but only if they read it very attentively, so it\u2019s in your interest to make sure it isn\u2019t read beyond the abstract. Finally, if your finding is really embarrassing, hide it away somewhere and cite \u2018data on file\u2019. Nobody will know the methods, and it will Page 610 only be noticed if someone comes pestering you for the data to do a systematic review. Hopefully, that won\u2019t be for ages.

The challenge of the missing dropouts belies a common weakness with questionnaires that are open to the public: those most likely to respond are often those who have had positive results. 8 This is a form of survivorship bias , a concept well worth understanding. Looking at average mutual fund returns from last year to pick a winner? Don\u2019t forget that you are asking the survivors. The casualties\u2014what Nassim Taleb refers to as \u201csilent evidence\u201d\u2014aren\u2019t around to be polled. The \u201caverage\u201d returns are less impressive if you can include the people who bet the farm and lost. Finding those dead bodies is hard, especially in finances, when there is so much incentive to cover them up. In practical terms, does this mean our diet results are bogus? Not at all. The possibility of survivorship bias isn\u2019t proof that the numbers aren\u2019t representative. Two things to keep in mind: 1. Based on all available empirical reports on the diet, the failure rate shouldn\u2019t exceed 5%. This is incredible by any conventional measure of diet compliance. 2. Nearly all reported failures are due to not following instructions. If we include only those people who followed directions exactly and provided feedback, the success percentage is as close to 100% as I\u2019ve seen anywhere. Discussion of Results How should you read these data? How should you plan or change your diet based on these results? Let\u2019s look at where you might make common mistakes. This is a practice run Page 616 of our Spotting Bad Science 101 training. Taking a first glance at the data, there are a few things we might conclude produce greater fat-loss, especially if we\u2019re presented with impressive-looking graphs that omit important details: Based on the data, here are some knee-jerk conclusions we could make about variables that result in more weight loss (bolded below): Eating just two meals per day, vs. five meals, the second-most-common number of meals (39- vs. 23-pound average loss) Eating a vegetarian diet (23- vs. 21-pound average loss) Counting calories (27-"

Did I just get it all wrong? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time. But let\u2019s look at those bolded conclusions again. This time, the numbers in parentheses before 194 (X/194) indicate how many people (X) did what is mentioned out of the total number of subjects (194). Eating just two meals per day vs. five (39- vs. 23-pound average loss) Page 617 (8/194) Eating a vegetarian diet (23- vs. 21-pound average loss) (10/194) Counting calories (27- vs. 20-pound average loss) (35/194) Skipping breakfast (23- vs. 21-pound average loss) (29/194) Remember that it\u2019s impossible to determine cause and effect from the above. These are correlations. The next step would be to test them with both control and experimental groups. But in the meantime, let\u2019s look at two of our bolded knee-jerk conclusions: EATING TWICE A DAY SEEMS LIKE A NO-BRAINER, BUT IT\u2019S NOT. 39 pounds lost vs. 23 seems to paint a clear picture. But let\u2019s ask ourselves what we don\u2019t know: how many people tried two meals and dropped out because it didn\u2019t work? Only eight of 194 people ate two meals a day. Also, how big were the people who ate twice a day? Perhaps they were 250\u2013300 pounds, making it easier to rack up total pounds lost, even though the weight lost as a percentage of body mass was more impressive for other smaller people. The vast majority of the total (144), those who averaged 19\u201320 pounds lost, ate three or four times per day, as recommended. COUNTING CALORIES SEEMS LIKE A NO-BRAINER, BUT IT\u2019S NOT. 27 pounds lost vs. 20\u2014again, the conclusion may seem obvious: calorie counting helps. Alas, it just ain\u2019t that simple. First, more than in any other cohort in these data, this is where I suspect survivorship bias applies. 35 of 194 respondents counted calories. How many tried to count calories, which I do not recommend, and quit the diet altogether after finding counting tedious, impossible, or inconvenient? Second, do calorie counters really lose more weight because of counting calories? Or is it because they\u2019re more attentive to the tracking in general and hold themselves more accountable? I suspect these calorie counters did a better job, on average, in more important areas like tracking protein intake and recording exercise progression. Does this mean you shouldn\u2019t track calories? Not necessarily. Feel free to test it. It\u2019s possible you\u2019ll be in the minority who benefit. If not, and if you\u2019re in the majority who find it boring and awful, just be sure to stop the calorie counting and return to basics before you quit the entire program. Conclusion Page 618 Though the data can point in interesting directions for further testing, I\u2019ll let someone with more budget and interest attempt the controlling. The upshot is: The Slow-Carb Diet works. If you want to replicate the formula that has proven most effective for the most people, follow the rules in \u201cThe Slow-Carb Diet.\u201d Enjoy cheat day. For that matter, eat a chocolate croissant for me. Those bad boys are delicious. Page 619 End of Chapter Notes 8.

    "text": "VITAMIN-RICH BUTTER FAT\u2014 TWO CAPSULES UPON WAKING AND TWO CAPSULES BEFORE BED I began taking fermented cod liver oil and butter fat after conversations with several MDs trained at Harvard and UCSF who cited the findings of Weston A. Price (1870\u20131948). Price, nicknamed \u201cthe Charles Darwin of Nutrition,\u201d was a researcher and dental surgeon who traveled the world throughout the 1930s recording the health and whole-food diets of isolated indigenous populations. Using meticulous notes and hundreds of photographs, he then compared each group with members of the same populations who had moved into cities and adopted industrialized diets. Through hundreds of settlements in 14 countries, from the remote villages of L\u00f6tschental, Switzerland, to the Jalou tribes of Kenya, from the American Indians to the Aborigines, he documented a diverse range of traditional diets. Some contained almost no plants, while others contained a plethora; some ate nearly all food cooked, whereas others preferred all foods, even animal meats, raw. Despite these differences, there were a few commonalities among the diets of the groups with the least incidence of disease. Three types of food are of particular interest in our libido discussion: 1. Lacto-fermented foods such as sauerkraut, kimchi, or Japanese natto, which appear a few times in this book, were staples. Page 621 2. 10 -fold the U.S. consumption level of vitamin D and vitamin A (animal-based retinol, not plant-based carotene) were consumed from sources such as egg yolks, fish oils, butter, lard, and foods with fat-rich cellular membranes (fish eggs, shellfish, and organ meats). 3. The diets included foods rich in what Price called \u201cActivator X,\u201d now thought to be vitamin K(2) based on analysis performed by Chris Masterjohn. Common sources included fish eggs, cod liver oil, organ meats, and the deep yellow butter from cows eating rapidly growing green grass. If \u201cActivator X\u201d is, in fact, vitamin K(2), then Japanese natto is perhaps the best traditional source at 1,103.4 micrograms per 100 grams. It outguns goose liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 (yum) (369 micrograms) in second place and the hard cheeses (76.3 micrograms) in third place by almost 3 times and 14 times, respectively. Why are these three relevant to our discussion? Vitamin A has a direct positive effect on testosterone production in adult testes, and supplementation along with zinc has been shown to be as effective as anabolic steroid administration (oxandrolone and testosterone depot) in stimulating growth and puberty, the latter defined as an increase in testicular volume of 12 milliliters or more. Vitamin K(2) activates vitamin A- and D-dependent proteins by conferring upon them the physical ability to bind calcium. Dr. Price had no shortage of real- world examples of how K(2) amplifies the effects of A and D: Cod liver oil, which is high in both vitamins A and D, partially corrected growth retardation and weak legs in turkeys fed a deficiency diet, but the combination of cod liver oil and high-Activator X butter was twice as effective. It has also been hypothesized that vitamin D toxicity is often a result of vitamin K deficiency. If you choose to supplement with vitamins A and D, as I do with cod liver oil and liquid vitamin D, it is important to ensure adequate K(2). Suggested sources include butter from grass-fed cows and the aforementioned lacto-fermented foods. In practice, and as a personal example, this just means I have a few forkfuls of kimchi or sauerkraut in the morning while I wait for my scrambled eggs 9 to cook in\u2014what else?\u2014butter from grass-fed cows. Easy peazy. VITAMIN D3\u20146,000\u201310,000 IU PER DAY FOR FOUR WEEKS One of the top sports scientists in the United States, who wished to remain anonymous, recounted a single anecdote that led me to a closer reexamination of Page 622 vitamin D: One NFL player I ended up treating had experienced debilitating shoulder pain for years and had two surgeries as a result, all to little or no effect.

    "text": "testing his vitamin D levels, it became clear that he was severely deficient. Six weeks after taking vitamin D, his shoulder pain was nonexistent. He had two surgeries for no reason. Vitamin D, it turns out, does a lot more than most vitamins. Once vitamin D is activated within the body as calcitriol, it acts as a steroid hormone and regulates more than 1,000 vitamin D\u2013responsive genes, including those that code for specific muscle fibers. It can increase the size and number of type 2 (fast-twitch) fibers, which, as indicated earlier, have the greatest potential for growth. It is one of the most overlooked \u201csleeper nutrients,\u201d according to John Anderson, professor emeritus of nutrition at the University of North Carolina. The effect can be substantial. Even at just 1,000 IU 10 daily for two years, 48 elderly females deficient in vitamin D (as I was) tripled their percentage of fast- twitch muscle fibers and doubled fiber diameter in functional limbs. The control group experienced no gains. Peak athletic performance appears to begin when blood levels approach those obtained through persistent full-body exposure to natural summer sun: 50 ng/ml . Do you think you get enough sun? It\u2019s unlikely. Even in the endless summer of subtropical Miami, a surprisingly high incidence of vitamin D deficiency has been recorded, as most people either use sunblock or avoid prolonged sun exposure. Forty percent of Louisiana-based runners tested in another study, all of whom trained outdoors, registered insufficient vitamin D levels. Indoor workers and athletes are top candidates for major insufficiencies: Lovell and collaborators found 15 of 18 elite female gymnasts tested to have levels below 30 ng/ml, and 6 to have levels below 20 ng/ml. Simple at-home tests (see the resources listed in the \u201cGetting Tested\u201d appendix) can tell you where you are, and consistent UV-B or sun exposure (20\u2013 30 minutes at least twice per week, depending on latitude), along with sublingual D3, can get you to our minimal target of 50 ng/ml. More than 100 ng/ml is considered excessive, and more than 150 ng/ml is considered toxic. If you don\u2019t get tested and blindly take vitamin D, you run the risk of overdose. One mild overdose symptom can be a metallic taste in the mouth, Page 623 which Neil from \u201cOccam\u2019s Protocol\u201d experienced. In our rush to start the program, and based on the average deficiencies I\u2019d seen in the blood reports of past subjects, we neglected to get his vitamin D tested. I didn\u2019t realize that he surfed for several hours a day. Establish your baseline first. My Experience Baseline from first blood test: 32 ng/ml Second test on 8/20/09 (after two months of taking 1,000 IU/day and 20 minutes of sun exposure daily): 35 ng Third test 5 weeks later on 9/25/09 (after increasing intake to 7,200 IU/day): 59 ng/ml I split the 7,200 IU into two doses: 1.5 droppers full of Now \u00ae liquid vitamin D3 upon waking and again before bed. It\u2019s important to test droppers, rather than trust label claims: even though the bottle claims 5,000 IU per dropperful, the average dropper yield was just 24 drops and 4 drops is 400 IU, so the average full dropper therefore contained 2,400 IU\u2014roughly half of the label claim. I saw the greatest impact on performance once I crossed the 50 ng/ml barrier and reached 55 ng/ml, after which the effects plateaued. The performance enhancement of vitamin D is well documented, at least as a result of using UV lights: In 1944, German investigators irradiated 32 medical students, twice a week for 6 wk, finding irradiated students showed a 13% improvement in performance on a bike ergometer, whereas performance of the control students was unchanged. In 1945, Allen and Curaton measured cardiovascular fitness and muscular endurance for 10 wk in 11 irradiated male Illinois college students, comparing them with 10 matched unirradiated controls, both groups undergoing similar physical training. The treatment group achieved a 19.2% standard score gain in"

Page 624 SHORT ICE BATHS AND/OR COLD SHOWERS\u2014 10 MINUTES UPON WAKING AND BEFORE BED Using ice baths and cold showers to affect sex hormones is largely untested in the literature, but there appear to be plausible mechanisms. The preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus is responsible for regulating thermogenesis\u2014the generation of heat in response to cold exposure. The very same preoptic area also contains most GnRH-releasing neurons, making it a primary site of GnRH production. Pulses of GnRH, you might recall, then trigger either FSH (low-frequency pulses) or LH release (high-frequency pulses). Looking at blood test changes after removing and then reincorporating both baths and showers as an isolated variable, I believe intermittent cold exposure has a positive impact on high-frequency pulses of GnRH, resulting in higher levels of LH and testosterone. Protocol #2: Short-Term and Fun 20\u201324 HOURS PRIOR TO SEX The evening before your target sex day, consume at least 800 milligrams of cholesterol within two hours of bedtime. I\u2019ve duplicated the sex drive\u2013increasing effect in more than a dozen trials, which began with high-dose grass-fed beef at 16\u201320 ounces per sitting. I initially thought that higher meat consumption was accountable. Based on the literature, it seems that overfeeding or carnitine could be responsible, the latter of which has been shown to be important for sperm production (spermatogenesis) and quality (motility). The problem with this hypothesis is that four ounces of beef steak contain 56\u2013162 milligrams of carnitine. Grass-fed beef is higher in L- carnitine content and (in general) the redder the meat, the higher the carnitine content. But even if we assume the higher per ounce value of 37.5 milligrams (150 milligrams in 4 ounces) for medium-rare grass-fed beef, we\u2019d need to consume 53 ounces of meat to reach the clinical dosing of two grams per day. Even for an avid meat-eater, this is disgusting. Though I suspect there are nontrivial effects at doses less than two grams per day, I wanted to look for Page 625 alternative explanations. The simple solution was found in eggs. I wanted to isolate cholesterol as a variable because of its potential dose- dependent SHBG-lowering effect, and a single large egg yolk provides more than two-thirds of the USRDA cholesterol limit of 300 milligrams, meaning 200 milligrams per yolk. The minimum threshold for a very noticeable effect appeared to be 800 milligrams of cholesterol, or four whole eggs. If you want a tasty bonus, add in reduced-fat Swiss cheese, which has the highest levels of CLA (conjugated linolenic acid) of all cheeses, with natural Muenster in second place. FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO SEX 4 Brazil nuts 20 raw almonds 2 capsules of the aforementioned cod/butter combination Brazil Nut Explanation: I began consuming Brazil nuts for selenium, as I tested deficient in this trace mineral after sending blood samples to SpectraCell, the same micronutrient testing lab allegedly used by Lance Armstrong. Brazil nuts have been shown in clinical studies to be more effective than supplementation for increasing selenium, which is important in our context, as selenium has been shown to increase sperm production and sperm quality. Both good things for the twins. But why was I deficient in selenium in the first place? Was it simply because I didn\u2019t eat enough selenium-containing foods like beef? Or, and this is critical, was something else competing with selenium or removing it from my body? This is the more neglected question. It is also a bigger problem, as you can\u2019t fix it by slamming pills or potions. Based on a review of published studies, I formed three hypotheses related to my selenium deficiency: 1. Even though I consumed"

Going in and out of ketosis had created a selenium deficiency. Unbeknownst to me, long-term ketogenic dieting has been associated with selenium deficiency. This was a real lightbulb moment. 3. Selenium protects against mercury by binding to it. Elevated blood mercury levels, which I tested positive for, could therefore also contribute to selenium deficiency. Once I had a few plausible explanations, it was time to test corrective actions: Corrective action #1: I began to consume three Brazil nuts at breakfast and three Brazil nuts at bedtime. Too much selenium hurts swimmies, so I kept well within the tolerable upper limit for adults, which is 400 micrograms per day. One ounce of Brazil nuts (approximately 11 nuts) provides 544 micrograms, so 400 micrograms is approximately eight nuts per day (49 micrograms each). I am consuming six to play well within nontoxic ranges. I experimented twice with higher ranges of 8\u201310 nuts per day; in both cases, I immediately broke out in the worst acne of my life. Though selenium deficiencies can cause skin problems, it appears that excessive selenium, or at least Brazil nuts, can do the same. Corrective action #2: Second, I am ensuring that I exit ketosis at least once per week by consuming carbohydrates \u00e0 la the Saturday cheat day on the Slow-Carb Diet. Since I have tested deficient, I am also consuming one cheat meal every other week for Wednesday lunch, which generally includes a single bowl of brown rice with a Thai meal. Corrective action #3: I began to attempt to remove mercury from my body Page 627 without killing myself. Despite multiple DMPS IV chelation sessions, urine tests showed almost no noticeable changes in mercury levels. To date, chelation has not shown benefits, but I plan to experiment with a more extended protocol of 3 days on, 11 days off using EDTA suppositories (fun, fun!) to avoid the often severe side effects of oral chelation. Almonds Explanation for Testosterone Boost: Almonds were an accidental discovery. Late one evening, after realizing my bachelor refrigerator contained nothing but alcohol and various disgusting protein powders, I descended on a single large bag of almonds out of desperation. I was starving and ate about 30 almonds (one ounce). The following day, I had a much higher than normal sex drive and was puzzled. I was able to correlate it with the almond intake only after looking at a detailed food log. But what in almonds could have this effect? The only potential mechanism seemed to be high vitamin E content. Lo and behold, after this first experience, I tested deficient for vitamin E on the same SpectraCell test that uncovered the selenium issue. Looking more closely at the research studies on PubMed, I realized vitamin E not only had the potential to counter the oxidative stress that lowers testosterone and sperm production, but it had also been used successfully in combination with selenium and vitamin A (amazing coincidence, right?) for treating partial androgen deficiency in males. Most interesting to me, vitamin E stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) from the hypothalamus. Bingo. One ounce (30 almonds) gives you approximately 40% of your daily value (DV). I consume both raw almonds and organic almond butter to reach no more than 150% DV, often having two heaping tablespoons of the latter on celery stalks with breakfast. Like most things, too much vitamin E is as bad as too little. Rock it like Goldilocks: get it just right and get levels tested every two to three months. The results appear to be worth it. I do not have explanations for the apparent additive impact of several of the ingredients in the protocol cocktail, but removing any one piece seems to Page 628 decrease the libido effect. To confirm this, I\u2019ve systematically removed"

Even with the perfect diet, it is possible to develop nutrient deficiencies. How?

    "text": "often used in business to improve innovation and results in a specific area. The famous \u201clean manufacturing\u201d at Toyota was a result of applying positive constraints to wasteful processes. How do you apply this to diet? Simple: by eliminating certain foods for a limited period of time. For most omnivores, removing meat is the hardest, and\u2014 therefore\u2014the most valuable. To quote Dr. John Berardi (a meat-eater, like me), whom we\u2019ll meet later: \u201cIn our quest for filling one-third of our plate with animal flesh, sometimes we forget to think about what the other two-thirds should be filled with.\u201d The constraints of testing a primarily plant-based diet (what I\u2019ll refer to as \u201cPPBD\u201d), whether pescatarian, vegan, or elsewhere on the spectrum, demands a knowledge of food that transcends whatever you\u2019re eliminating. Even a two- week experiment produces huge permanent benefits. For example: if you know you might become deficient in B-12 on a PPBD, you learn about B-12, you learn about B vitamins, and you learn about vitamins in general, which might then branch your interest out to desiccated liver (a good source), which leads you to eat grass-fed local beef once a week on Saturdays instead of choosing to be vegan. It\u2019s about finding what\u2019s best for you. I suggest a two-week PPBD test after 3\u20134 months on the Slow-Carb Diet. No matter where you end up afterward, the awareness will lead to better decisions that benefit appearance, performance, and the planet as a whole. Page 633 Moving From Ideal to Practical: Five Steps A few definitions are in order before we get started: 1. The term \u201cvegetarian\u201d is so overused as to be meaningless. I define it here as someone whose food volume is at least 70% plant-based by volume. This is the aforementioned primarily plant-based diet (PPBD), and this is the term I\u2019ll use in place of \u201cvegetarian.\u201d On the Slow-Carb Diet, I consume a 60% minimum PPBD, meaning that most meals are 60%+ plant-based; 6/10ths of each plate is covered in veggies of some sort. 2. I define \u201cvegan\u201d here as someone who consumes no animal products except insect-produced goods such as honey. The latter is controversial for some vegans, but that is an argument for another book. If you are considering test-driving a PPBD, which I hope you will, I suggest that you make the transition from an animal-based diet gradual. It\u2019s better for the environment if you locally source a 70% PPBD 12 indefinitely, rather than eat 100% vegan for two months and quit because you find it unsustainable. Some vegans, lost in ideological warfare, also lose sight of cumulative effects: getting 20% of the population to take a few steps in the right direction will have an infinitely greater positive impact on the world than having 2% of the population following a 100% plant-based diet. To both uninformed meat-eaters and vegetarians\u2014stop ad hominem attacks and focus on the big picture. Of course, there are many vegetarians and vegans who object to any consumption of animal products as immoral, even if the animals are raised in humane and sustainable conditions. I won\u2019t address that here, as too many subjective definitions are involved. Instead, I will focus on the nutritional and logistical implications of following a PPBD. The following five-step sequence is simple to implement. Each step will make you a more conscious eater and serve to lessen your environmental impact: Step 1. Remove starches (rice, bread, grains) and add legumes. Dense products, like black bean burgers without buns, are encouraged. Binge on cheat foods once per week. Read the chapters on the Slow-Carb Diet as a refresher, if needed. Step 2. Ensure that all of your meat is pasture-raised, grass-fed, or sourced Page 634 within 50 miles of your home. Step 3. Eat meat only after 6:00 P.M . (what Mark Bittman and others refer to as the \u201cvegan till 6\u201d plan) or eat meat only on the weekends or on cheat days. Step 4.

    "text": "vegetarian). Bill Pearl won Mr. Universe in 1967 and 1971 as a lacto-ovo vegetarian, and he built 20 3/8-inch upper arms at 218 pounds. Red meat is not a requirement for growth. Step 5. Eat a 100% plant-based vegan diet. Removing too much, too quickly leads to abandoning positive changes. Skipping steps in this process usually creates a caloric void that makes you (1) feel terrible and revert to old habits or (2) fill the void with vegetarian junk food like processed fake meat, french fries, agave nectar, and sugar milk labeled as soy or almond milk. Take it one step at a time, and stop when you\u2019ve reached your sustainable threshold. I have experimented up to #5, but most consistently operate at #2. Getting Organized Make no mistake: In a world of ubiquitous meat and cheap animal protein, you will need to be more organized than your carnivorous cousins. How organized depends on your ambition. Becoming a fit \u201cvegetarian\u201d requires much less diligence than becoming a record-breaking vegan athlete. We\u2019ll look at the entire spectrum with real-world examples, including a slow- carb dieter, one of the most famous ultraendurance athletes of all time, and an omnivore scientist who tested veganism on himself for 28 days. My goal is to help you follow your own ethical or environmental guidelines without causing undue damage to yourself or your wallet. This chapter will also answer the most popular questions submitted by vegans among my 100,000+ Twitter followers: How do I get enough protein on a vegan diet? How can I do it without soy? What can I eat as a vegan while traveling? Page 635 Which supplements should I use to prevent deficiencies? Since these are the greatest concerns, let\u2019s address them before jumping into the case studies: HOW DO I GET ENOUGH PROTEIN ON A VEGAN DIET \u2026 WITHOUT SOY? Answer: first, we must define \u201cenough.\u201d By most carnivorous standards, the endurance athletes profiled in this chapter consume insufficient protein, yet they are able to compete at the highest levels in their sports. It\u2019s not limited to running, either. Mike Mahler, one well-known vegan strength athlete, consumes 100\u2013130 grams per day on training days and approximately 90 grams per day on nontraining days. Given his bodyweight of 197 and assumed lean body mass of 177.3 pounds (10% bodyfat), this computes as a high end of 0.73 grams per pound of lean bodyweight on training days and 0.51 grams per pound of lean bodyweight on nontraining days. Dr. John Berardi, whom we\u2019ll meet later, consumes a great deal more, but let\u2019s adopt Mahler\u2019s range as a target. How do you consume enough if you\u2019re aiming for a minimum of 0.5 grams per pound of lean bodyweight? To estimate this and err on the high side, just divide your bodyweight in half, (e.g., 150 lbs. \u2192 75 grams of protein). A high percentage of vegans use soy as their primary source of protein. This is a bad idea. Based on all of the literature I\u2019ve reviewed, the phytoestrogens in soy are dangerous for adults and, to a greater extent, children, even when used in moderation. Studies have demonstrated that just 30 grams of soy per day (about two tablespoons) for 90 days can disrupt thyroid function, and that\u2019s in Japanese subjects. The Swiss Federal Health Service equated 100 milligrams of isoflavones (phytoestrogens) to a single birth control pill in terms of estrogenic impact. How many birth control pills are you inadvertently eating each day? FOOD TOTAL ISOFLAVONES (IN 100 G SERVING) Instant soy beverage 109.51 mg Raw soybeans (Japanese) 118.51 mg (in less than half a cup) Fried tofu 48.35 mg (7\u20138 small pieces) Tempeh 43.52 mg (in less than two-thirds of a cup) Common infant soy formula 25 mg Estrogen overdosing isn\u2019t good for either gender, unless you\u2019re aiming for Page 636 sterility. So, how can you do it without soy? Answer: Either extensive whole foods, which requires prep time, or powdered protein, which requires budget. The whole-food options will be covered in the case studies, though you\u2019ll see"

    "text": "some soy products creep in. For supplementation, the most consistently recommended protein powders among vegan athletes are: Sun Warrior Chocolate Brown Rice Protein (rice protein) Pure Advantage Pea Protein Isolate (pea protein) Nitro Fusion Plant Fusion (rice, pea, and artichoke protein) I have also confirmed each of these as non-vomit-inducing when blended with 1\u20132 tablespoons of almond butter and either ice water, almond milk, or coconut milk. WHAT CAN I EAT AS A VEGAN WHILE TRAVELING? Answer: If we mean whole meals, the easiest is Mexican or Thai food, just as on the Slow-Carb Diet. Vegans opting for Mexican would order a number of sides like black beans (no lard), steamed veggies, and extra guacamole (this is fat- and calorie-rich and not to be neglected), either eaten alone or with corn tortillas. I suggest avoiding wheat, as do the world-class vegan athletes I interviewed. If caught in a bind with nothing but McDonald\u2019s and Pizza Hut in sight, a bag of 50+ raw almonds can sustain you for 10 or so hours until you find something more substantial. These can be found at almost all gas stations and airport magazine stores. Worst-case scenario, choose mild hunger over breaking your rules. WHAT SUPPLEMENTS SHOULD I USE? Answer: For essential insurance against serious health issues, ensure the following: 13 Page 637 My additional recommendations: The most important caveat of all: we can only identify deficiencies, and therefore supplementation, for things that scientists have isolated. See the conclusion of the next chapter for important warnings related to this. The Case Studies For each case study, I\u2019ll extract the most salient lessons and include both weekly grocery lists and, in athletic examples, go-to staple meals.

Here is his basic profile: 35-year-old software engineer Married, one daughter, one son on the way Started at 220 pounds and 33% bodyfat Ended at 189 pounds and 25% bodyfat In just under three months, he lost 31 pounds, 26 pounds of which was fat.

MARQUE\u2019S GROCERY LIST Marque spent just $60 per week on groceries, and his list requires 10\u201315 minutes of shopping: Large cartons of egg whites and/or tofu/milk/veggie protein powder. I tried to get around 19 grams of protein per meal. About 2 bags of black beans and/or chick peas and/or lentils.

    "text": "(All natural and no sugar. Make it if you have the time. I put this on my eggs when I got bored.) Exact portions aren\u2019t important, as adjustments will get you to your exact quantities by week three: People may buy too little or too much the first week or two, but by week three they will know how much they need. Marque explains his approach to tweaking the boilerplate Slow-Carb Diet: The insight that helped me adapt the slow-carb diet to vegetarianism came from using DailyBurn ( www.dailyburn.com ) to track my food. After a few days of entering my food, I noticed that my nutrient ratios, calculated on DailyBurn, were 40:30:30 (carbs:protein:fats). My wife has always been big on the Zone Diet, so I recognized the ratio right away as identical. I was hitting this ratio daily just by following your instructions, but eating only egg whites for my protein. As long as I reduced my carb intake from beans and vegetables, to account for the additional carbs I took in with soy products and dairy, my ratios were the same and I continued to lose weight. In other words: all of the protein sources in your original version are what I would refer to as \u201cisolated\u201d protein sources (chicken breast, fish, etc.) that contain almost no carbs. It\u2019s hard to find whole foods \u201cisolated\u201d protein sources as a vegetarian, so when I adapted this diet for vegetarianism, I thought of all the carbs in the protein-containing dairy or soy products as counting towards a total carb limit. I then subtracted veggies and legumes accordingly. For every 9 grams of carbs I got from a protein or fat source, I ate 9 grams of carb less from vegetable and legume sources. This helped me keep my ratios on track without much effort. The simplest solution to this problem is to avoid dairy and soy altogether, which I did for the most part. One might ask: why didn\u2019t I just switch to the Zone Diet? I didn\u2019t switch because the slow-carb diet as described by you is simpler and doesn\u2019t allow for \u201cless favorable\u201d foods which give less favorable results. It keeps things simple and is easier to follow. If I had just one last tip for following the slow-carb diet as a vegetarian, it would be simple: eat extra good fats. Since you are missing fats from animal-based protein sources, you need to supplement with flaxseed oil, olive oil, and nuts. 0.5\u20131 tablespoon twice a Page 641 day did it for me. If I didn\u2019t supplement fats, I felt tired and mentally off. I have since become a vegan and removed soy from my diet completely. Currently my main source of isolated protein is pea and rice protein powders, my favorite being Plant Fusion by Nitro Fusion. Mike Mahler does not fit the vegan stereotype. He\u2019s trained athletes like former UFC champion Frank Shamrock, he can one- arm military press a 97-pound kettlebell 10 times, and can one-arm kettlebell snatch a 105-pound kettlebell 17 times with each arm. This is at a lean bodyweight of 197 pounds. He makes his own protein bars, and the following is his favorite recipe: 4 scoops of vanilla Sunwarrior Protein Powder (60 grams of high-quality protein and iron) 2 tbsp almond butter (good protein, fat, and magnesium) 1 tbsp cashew nut butter 3 tbsp flax powder (contains omega-3 and fiber; increases ratio of good estrogens to bad) 1 tbsp Maca (plant sterols, hormone support) \u00bc cup walnuts \u00bc cup Goji berries (high in vitamin A, vitamin C, and iron) 2 tbsp pumpkin pie spice (loaded with healthy spices) 1 tsp stevia 1\u00bd cups water Preheat oven to 425\u00b0. Mix everything in a bowl with a spoon until a thick paste forms. Divide into eight parts, then shape into cookies. Place on cookie sheets and bake for 15 minutes. Total Nutrition Profile (all eight cookies) Protein: 79 g Carbohydrates: 63 g Page 642 Fat: 30 g MARQUE\u2019S FAVORITE MEALS AND STAPLE MEALS There is no need to complicate things: One thing that has helped me a lot was to let go of the distinction between breakfast foods and \u201cother meal\u201d foods.

Choose a few meals and repeat. Simple wins. Scott Jurek Scott Jurek is a veritable demi-god in the sport of ultramarathoning, which involves races of more than marathon length. He has won the 100-mile Western States Endurance Run an incredible seven consecutive times, twice won the Badwater Ultramarathon, described as \u201cthe world\u2019s toughest race,\u201d and also holds the American record for 24-hour running, in which he logged 165.705 miles to beat Rae Clark\u2019s 20-year-old record. SCOTT\u2019S GROCERY LIST Get ready to enter the mother lode. Scott\u2019s leave-no-stone-unturned approach is a sharp contrast to Marque\u2019s minimalism. I had one of my unsuspecting researchers, Charlie Hoehn, head off to Whole Foods to gather the list and time himself, from entering the store to leaving the store. He arrived at Whole Foods at 3:38 P.M . and left at 6:20 P.M . for a total time of: 2 hours, 42 minutes. This was, of course, a first-time expedition, and Charlie had to search for everything. To account for this, I had him review locations within the store the following day and then repeat the drill the day thereafter. For the second round of timing, Charlie rearranged all of the items on the list into groups based on areas of the store (to cut down on walking back and forth), and he had a friend tag along to read the list and check off items. Charlie\u2019s job Page 643 was pure speed. Sprinting around the store behind the cart like a kid on a Nickelodeon shopping spree, he cut the total time in the store down to 1 hour. The total cost, regardless of time, was $541.09 . Some of the items (supplements, protein powder) would be used over several weeks, so I also had Charlie determine the weekly cost for these items based on number of servings. This shaves off $121.83, giving you a new weekly total of $419.26 . Scott\u2019s weekly shopping list is below, along with the substitute items Charlie bought (bolded) when he couldn\u2019t find them at Whole Foods. Keep in mind that this list is for a peak training period, when Scott would be consuming 5,000\u2013 6,000 calories/day at approximately 60\u201370% carbohydrate, 20\u201330% fat, and 15\u2013 20% protein.

First, an example of the former, fiber and lectin side effects: High-calorie vegetarian meal plans are hard to digest. Diets high in plant foods contain a ton of fiber and lectins. Fiber is good for us in the right amount, but when fiber is consumed in excess, it prevents the digestion and absorption of other nutrients. It also upsets the stomach, leading to diarrhea, gas, and bloating. Furthermore, lectins can be problematic in and of themselves. Many people are lectin intolerant, and consumption leads to symptoms similar to lactose intolerance: massive bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea. In fact, when I Page 655 followed my plant-based diet, by the end of the day, my waist circumference, which is 32 inches upon rising, ballooned up to a full 42 inches. Not attractive, and very uncomfortable. Second, a logistical example: the importance of \u201cbatching\u201d food prep and preparing certain foods in bulk a few days or a week in advance. This helps prevent defaulting to vegetarian junk foods: With all my groceries at home, I did two things right off the bat. First, I mixed up my granola and ate a big bowl. Second, I started soaking the dry beans. By soaking beans for about 12 hours with a"

Also, this strategy helps to remove some of the anti-nutrients present in beans. 15 About 12 hours later, I boiled two large pots of the pre-soaked legumes. One pot contained a mixture of navy beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans, along with red and green lentils. The other contained garbanzo beans only. When prepping the beans, I also pre-chopped some green peppers, red peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, and sugar snap peas for the week. This way I couldn\u2019t use chopping as an excuse for missing a meal. The mixed beans were stored in the fridge and the garbanzo beans were then turned into homemade hummus and placed, with my pre-chopped veggies, on the wraps. Questions with Dr. Berardi WHAT WAS YOUR DAILY MACRONUTRIENT BREAKDOWN ON THIS DIET? \u201cThe macronutrient breakdown, including supplements, was: 5,589 kcal [about the same as Scott Jurek during training] 247 g fat (38% of total caloric intake) 68 g saturated 64.5 g polyunsaturated 92 g monounsaturated Page 656 653.7 g carbohydrate (46% of total caloric intake) 112 g fiber 246 g protein (16% of total caloric intake) \u201cEven with the high caloric load, without B-12 supplementation and vitamin D supplementation, I would have fallen short of the RDA [recommended daily allowance] for both nutrients. With the supplements, I was more than adequately covered.\u201d WHAT WAS YOUR FOOD COST FOR THE WEEK? \u201cDuring the plant-based experiment, I was spending about $80 per week for food. That\u2019s around $20\u201330 less than normal (i.e., when I\u2019m eating a more varied diet that includes animal foods).\u201d WHAT IS YOUR BEST ESTIMATE OF YOUR SUPPLEMENT COST PER WEEK (UNDERSTANDING YOU MIGHT NEED TO DIVIDE SOME COSTS, AS A BOTTLE MIGHT LAST A WHILE)? \u201cDuring the experiment, I was using about $60 per week in supplements (BCAA, resveratrol, multi-vitamin, D, B-12, protein, greens, DHA, carb drink). That\u2019s about $20\u201330 more than I might normally spend for supplements. \u201cThis means that, combining food and supplement costs, I spent the same amount total as when including animal products.\u201d IF YOU HADN\u2019T EATEN EGGS, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED? \u201cSame exact results, I think.\u201d IF YOU\u2019D CONTINUED THE PLANT-BASED DIET FOR SIX MONTHS, WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED? \u201cI would have continued to gain weight, for sure. \u201cHowever, I think I might have created serious digestive problems. Many experts believe that continually eating foods that cause GI distress can lead to chronic gut inflammation, \u2018leaky gut syndrome,\u2019 and a host of autoimmune problems.\u201d VEGANS TALK ABOUT COMBINING FOODS FOR COMPLETE PROTEINS\u2014RICE AND BEANS, FOR EXAMPLE, OR LEGUMES AND SEEDS OR NUTS. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? \u201cThe research is showing that, to prevent protein malnutrition, food combining isn\u2019t necessary. Rather, if all the essential amino acids are eaten in a single day, people are fine. Page 657 \u201cHowever, from an optimization and sports performance perspective, I think that a complete complement of amino acids should be eaten each meal. There are some data to support that there\u2019s an \u2018amino-stat\u2019 in the brain that senses blood amino acids. And if we eat incomplete proteins, the body releases the \u2018missing\u2019 amino acids from muscle to balance out the blood amino acids \u2026 It\u2019s hard to build muscle or recover from training adequately if your diet is kicking off a muscle catabolic sequence.\u201d IS IT POSSIBLE TO BE VEGAN LONG-TERM USING ONLY WHOLE FOODS AND WITHOUT PROTEIN SUPPLEMENTATION? \u201cYes, without protein supplementation, it\u2019s totally possible, but it\u2019s much more difficult. And without some guidance, it\u2019s unlikely that people will do it properly if muscle building or high-level sport performance is the goal. \u201cBut it is possible.\u201d WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES SELF-DESCRIBED \u201cVEGETARIANS\u201d MAKE? \u201c Just dropping animal foods. The worst mistake any would-be vegan could make is to simply stop eating meat. Then their"

    "text": "lifestyle choice isn\u2019t a positive one, it\u2019s about negation. 16 Instead, people should focus on what they\u2019ll be eating more of. In other words, a proper vegetarian meal plan is based on eating mostly or only foods that come from plants: fruits, veggies, unprocessed grains, legumes, etc. It\u2019s not simply avoiding meat and filling up on processed junk foods. And this is something many vegetarians do. By focusing only on what they\u2019re dropping, there\u2019s no plan for getting enough calories, enough protein, and enough micronutrition to ensure an easy transition to vegetarianism. \u201c Using dairy for all their protein. Many lacto-ovo vegetarians will turn to dairy for all their protein needs when dropping meat. This can be a big mistake for a few reasons. First of all, lactose-intolerance and milk protein allergy are quite common\u2014more common than most people think. Second of all, most store-bought milk and dairy offerings contain hormone and antibiotic residues, which are now being shown to negatively impact human health. Of course, in small doses (i.e., one cup of dairy per day), this isn\u2019t much of a problem unless you\u2019re highly sensitive, but using dairy multiple times per day can create big problems. \u201c Not using supplements. As discussed above, by dropping entire food groups from your menu, you\u2019re bound to create some dietary deficiencies if you\u2019re not careful. So you have to supplement, and very few vegetarian athletes know what to do in this regard. \u201cUse the supplements in my daily menu as a basic guide. It might seem like a Page 658 pretty long list of nutrients to be mindful of, and it is. If you\u2019re going to make the lifestyle choice to become a vegan or vegetarian, you have to accept the responsibilities that such a choice foists upon you. If not, you\u2019re just being negligent, and you can expect health problems to follow.\u201d WHAT DID YOU CONCLUDE AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE? \u201cI\u2019ve come to conclude that vegetarianism can work, but this usually requires the help of a trained nutrition coach. Done right, vegetarianism can be satisfying, healthy, and performance- boosting. \u201cThat said, I\u2019ve also concluded that vegetarianism is a real challenge for the average person. Without meticulous planning and some nutritional guidance, most are doomed to muscle loss, poor performance, and a host of nutritional deficiencies, ranging from mild to severe. \u201cIt\u2019s not a change to take lightly, and most people don\u2019t have the discipline to prevent digressions and corner-cutting that will have serious consequences over time.\u201d Meat vs. Plant\u2014Bridging the Divide Some of John\u2019s meat-eating supporters became enraged by his 28-day experiment, one going so far as to FedEx him grass-fed sirloin packed in dry ice. Carnivores can take vegetarianism very personally. On the other side of the fence, die-hard vegans tore into him for compromising in a few areas and not going pure 100% vegan. Hate mail abounded. As usual, the extremists on both sides were missing the point. It was an experiment, not a moral statement, and there were valuable lessons to be learned by purists from both sides. For the militant vegans, the primary lesson is that omnivores can quickly transition to a near-vegan PPBD if they make some allowances for protein (such as two to three eggs per day). If this compromise isn\u2019t allowed, crossing the chasm can take months and, more often than not, never happens. For the omnivores and carnivores, the benefits of considering a vegan diet are multifold, even if it\u2019s just a thought experiment: If I couldn\u2019t eat any animal products for 28 days, what would I eat? John summarizes a few areas where proper vegans (the organized and Page 659 informed minority) trump 99% of meat-eaters: \u201cProper vegans tend to eat more whole, natural, locally produced, and unprocessed foods than most omnivores. This means things like raw nuts and seeds, whole grains like quinoa and amaranth, and a locally grown bounty of fruits and veggies. That\u2019s all they eat, so they make sure to do it"

    "text": "right. \u201cSpeaking as an omnivore, in our quest for filling one-third of our plate with animal flesh, sometimes we forget to think about what the other two-thirds should be filled with. And that can be a big, gut-expanding, health-degrading mistake. \u201cProper vegans also tend to spend more time learning about where their food comes from. In other words, they make it a point to understand which foods come from which regions of the world, which foods are in season during certain times of the year, and which methods are best for raising the healthiest food. \u201cNot only is this environmentally friendly and quite healthy, it\u2019s also pretty cool stuff to know.\u201d When Francis M. Pottenger Jr. was a newly graduated California doctor in 1932, he spent 10 years studying cats. Nine hundred cats over three generations, to be precise. Pottenger\u2019s experiments are often cited by raw-food enthusiasts as evidence of the superiority of raw food. Experiment #1: Raw Meat vs. Cooked Meat. Pottenger fed one group of cats a diet of two-thirds raw meat, one-third raw milk, and cod liver oil. He fed the second group two-thirds cooked meat, one-third raw milk, and cod liver oil. The cats fed raw meat were, by all measures, normal and healthy. The cats fed cooked meat produced kittens that had skeletal deformities, heart problems, vision problems, multiple infections, irritability, allergies, difficult births, and even paralysis. Rut-roh! Experiment #2: Raw Milk vs. Cooked Milk. This time Pottenger had four groups of cats. The first group got two-thirds raw milk, one-third raw meat, and cod liver oil. The other three groups got either two-thirds pasteurized milk, two-thirds evaporated milk, or two-thirds sweetened condensed milk Page 660 in place of the raw milk. He saw the same pattern of happy, healthy cats on raw milk, and all manner of abnormal development in the other groups, getting worse as the milk was more processed. Based on these experiments, Pottenger concluded that \u201cthe elements in raw food which activate and support growth and development in the young appear easily altered and destroyed by heat processing.\u201d He went on to extrapolate that humans suffer from the same nutritional deficiencies that are causing more developmental problems with each generation: \u201ccanning, packaging, pasteurizing, and homogenizing\u2014all contribute to hereditary breakdown.\u201d Hmmm. This sounds like a compelling, fear-inducing argument. But here\u2019s what Pottenger didn\u2019t know when he said this: cats need taurine. Taurine is a component of bile acid that cats can\u2019t synthesize on their own, but humans can. It helps with digestion and is a supplement in commercial cat food. If cats are taurine-deficient, they show vision problems, heart problems, and developmental problems. Sound familiar? Guess what else? Taurine is deactivated by heat. So Pottenger\u2019s cooked meat/milk diets would have been taurine-deficient. Another factor to consider: cats are carnivores, humans are omnivores. It\u2019s like comparing apples to oranges, as we have different nutritional requirements. A better animal model for humans would be mice, or rats, or primates. Without even calling into question how well controlled Pottenger\u2019s study was, it doesn\u2019t make good scientific sense to transfer what he learned about cats directly to humans. But back to the crux of the debate: Should humans eat raw food or cooked food? It all depends. Here are some examples, each supported in the scientific literature: Page 661 By all means, go ahead and eat raw food if you like, or be vegan, or go gluten- free, or eat a few cats (I suggest fajitas). Just make sure you do your homework. Don\u2019t confuse ideology with good science. Take an honest look at the available research (applicable to humans) so that you can make a well-informed decision. It\u2019s your body, after all. Darwin\u2019s Rule\u2014Eat for Fertility So if vegetarianism can be done, why am I not a vegetarian in the usual sense?

    "text": "irresponsible, so allow me to explain the reasons: 1. I have been unable to find a single indigenous population that has thrived on a 100% PPBD, even after asking my 100,000+ Twitter followers to help me find one. Low animal product consumption is simple to find, but even the famous Jains of India are, with rare exception, lacto-ovo vegetarians. Dr. Weston Price (see \u201cSex Machine II\u201d) and others have been similarly unable to find a vegan indigenous culture in anthropological expeditions. 2. Our closest relatives, chimpanzees, are occasional meat-eaters, and Page 662 humans produce the enzyme elastase, which serves to break down connective tissue for digestion. There are, on both sides of the fence, avid debates of evolutionary biology and conflicting data points, but the argument-settling experience for me was empirical: 3. In the course of researching and interviewing for this book, I encountered dozens of former vegan women and would-be mothers who had miscarriage after miscarriage until they reintroduced animal products into their diets, after which they were able to become pregnant in a matter of weeks. Based on the above and my own experiments, I\u2019ve concluded that some form of animal product is necessary for proper hormone production. This could be due to the longer-chain fatty acids, saturated fat, cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, or (more likely) a combination of interdependent elements, some of which we haven\u2019t even identified. It\u2019s also possible that common vegetarian staples cause the problems, whether soy or gluten. Either way, it\u2019s significant that boys born with hypospadias, the opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis rather than at the tip, are five times more likely to have vegetarian vs. omnivore mothers. Dr. Richard Sharpe, director of the Medical Research Centre for Reproductive Biology in Edinburgh, Scotland, echoes my conclusion about soy: \u201cI\u2019ve seen numerous studies showing what soy does to female animals. Until I have reassurance that it doesn\u2019t have this effect on humans, I will not give soy to my children.\u201d Food is complex and humans are overconfident. Consider the antioxidants we\u2019ve identified thus far in garden-variety thyme, as listed by Michael Pollan in a New York Times Magazine article: 4-Terpineol, alanine, anethole, apigenin, ascorbic acid, beta carotene, caffeic acid, camphene, carvacrol, chlorogenic acid, chrysoeriol, eriodictyol, eugenol, ferulic acid, gallic acid, gamma-terpinene isochlorogenic acid, isoeugenol, isothymonin, kaempferol, labiatic acid, lauric acid, linalyl acetate, luteolin, methionine, myrcene, myristic acid, naringenin, oleanolic acid, p-coumoric acid, p-hydroxy-benzoic acid, palmitic acid, rosmarinic acid, selenium, tannin, thymol, tryptophan, Page 663 ursolic acid, vanillic acid. And that\u2019s just thyme. So we must have it all figured out, right? My vote: not a chance. Pollan offered the list to make the same point: It\u2019s also important to remind ourselves that what reductive science can manage to perceive well enough to isolate and study is subject to change, and that we have a tendency to assume that what we can see is all there is to see. When William Prout isolated the big three macronutrients, scientists figured they now understood food and what the body needs from it; when the vitamins were isolated a few decades later, scientists thought, O.K., now we really understand food and what the body needs to be healthy; today it\u2019s the polyphenols and carotenoids that seem all-important. But who knows what the hell else is going on deep in the soul of a carrot? Never forget: 1. We can only determine deficiencies for things we\u2019ve isolated. 2. Taking those isolated nutrients outside of whole foods can produce side effects we cannot predict. Scurvy was a mysterious problem for thousands of years. Only in 1932 did scientists isolate vitamin C and determine that the two were related. Much later, when beta-carotene became popular in the media as a miracle molecule,"

    "text": "we took a more proactive approach and began to supplement. Better safe than sorry, right? Unfortunately, as we found out, taking supplemental beta- carotene by itself can cause problems. It can block the absorption of other beneficial carotenoids and increase the risk of prostate cancer and intracerebral hemorrhage, among other things. It\u2019s best absorbed in combination with its close cousins in whole foods, in naturally accuring ratios. There will be similar mistakes and discoveries in years to come. In cases where I can find an indigenous population that has lived without a food group for hundreds of years (fruit, for example, which is easy), I don\u2019t worry much about excluding it. If I can\u2019t find such a group, I\u2019d suggest that our science hasn\u2019t caught up with Darwinism. Eater beware. Page 664 My general guideline, what I refer to as \u201cDarwin\u2019s Rule,\u201d is simple: eat for optimal fertility and everything else falls into place. Moreover, if you eat for optimal fertility, you will have high-level athletic performance and what most define as optimal health. No matter which diet you choose, I encourage you to have the following tests, as a minimum, every six months. If you are eliminating animal products entirely, I suggest every three months. All of these tests are common enough that your general practitioner or primary care doctor should, in theory, be able to order them. In many cases, insurance will cover them, but be willing to ante up in cash if needed. If you chose to be vegan, this is not the place to cut costs. Some primary care doctors will not feel comfortable administering the fancier gynecological tests and will refer you to an ob/gyn specialist. That\u2019s fine: just get them done. You don\u2019t need to know what all of these mean; you just need to photocopy them and have a conversation with your doctor. 17 If male, have these tests: Semen analysis (includes volume, which should be >1.5 ml; concentration/count > 20 million/ml; motility > 40%; morphology > 30% normal by WHO criteria) Testosterone (both total and free) Estradiol Luteinizing hormone (LH) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (tests hypothalamus functioning) Prolactin (pituitary level) Total cholesterol (160\u2013200) AST (20\u201330) ALT (20\u201330) If female, have these tests: Estradiol Luteinizing hormone (LH) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (tests hypothalamus functioning) Page 665 Prolactin (pituitary level) Total cholesterol (160\u2013200) AST (20\u201330) ALT (20\u201330) Day 3 FSH and E2 (estradiol) blood tests (looks at ovarian reserve; the doctor can also do an antral follicular count by ultrasound and/or check anti-muellerian hormone by blood) Those are the basics. For women, it can pay to take a slightly more detailed look at things: 1) It may seem obvious, but a woman first needs to have periods to see if she is ovulating. It is important to be off of oral contraceptives to determine this. Unfortunately, some doctors prescribe \u201cthe pill\u201d to vegetarians to initiate menstruation, which simply masks symptoms instead of addressing root causes. Do an over-the-counter urine LH test , starting at approximately day 9 (most women have LH peak and subsequent ovulation 24\u201336 hours later during days 12\u201315). Using urine LH test strips is much easier than doing basal body temperatures and looking for a rise in temperature after ovulation. 2) To check the uterus and fallopian tubes: do a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) (dye shot into cervix and imaging) and/or saline sonohystogram (the former is a better test) 3) To check the luteal phase, do a \u201cpooled\u201d progesterone test in the luteal phase\u2014five to nine days after the LH surge, on three days in the second half of the cycle. Determine average progesterone. _________ The upshot of all this: There is no sin in considering consuming animal products once per week if you are currently a vegan, if it means you will be healthier and better able to convert others to a similar mode of eating. The ideal is, of course, to find a mode that is farsighted on both"

Page 670 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First, I must thank the self-experimenters, scientists, and athletes whose incredible methods are the lifeblood of this book, including those who preferred to remain anonymous. Even if your name doesn\u2019t appear in these pages, your contributions are no less spectacular. If I\u2019ve omitted anyone by accident, I can only offer my sincerest apologies. Please reach out to me if I somehow lapsed, and I\u2019ll make amends. To Stephen Hanselman, the best agent in the world, I thank you for \u201cgetting\u201d the book at first glance and helping to midwife it into existence. From negotiation to nonstop jazz, you amaze me. Heather Jackson, your insightful editing and incredible cheerleading has made this book a pleasure to write. Thank you for believing in me! To the entire Crown Publishing team, especially those whom I bother (because I love them) more than four hours a week, you are the backbone of this book: Tina Constable, Maya Mavjee, Michael Palgon, Linda Kaplan, Karin Schulze, Jacqueline Lebow, Jill Flaxman, Meredith McGinnis, Jill Browning, Mary Choteborsky, Robert Siek, Elizabeth Rendfleisch, Tara Agroskin, and Jennifer Reyes. This book was also first drafted using Scrivener, a gorgeous application, and Keith Blount kept me sane as I tested the limits of the software. I owe particular gratitude to Charlie Hoehn and Alexandra Carmichael. Where to begin? Charlie, you were a co-creator and co-conspirator from the very earliest stages. I can only hope that the end product makes you proud. God knows we pulled enough all-nighters over Casino Royale to kill a giraffe, and they only need 1.5 hours of sleep per night. The Photoshop was priceless, and I only regret I didn\u2019t have more shiny, full-color chapters to give you migraines. Many future adventures await, and the mischief alone will be the stuff of legend. Alexandra, you are a princess and a brilliant mind. This book would not exist without your research and your ability to weave enjoyable stories from journal-bound science. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you. CureTogether.com rocks! To Nate Green, the interviews (and therefore several chapters) quite simply wouldn\u2019t have been possible without your help. Thank you for the much-needed save and the deadlift kick-in-the-ass. I\u2019ll stick with sumo. To Jack Canfield, you are an inspiration and have shown me that it is possible to make it huge and still be a wonderful, kind human being. The 4-Hour Page 671 Workweek, which gave me permission to write this book, was just an idea until"

    "text": "you encouraged me to take the leap. I cannot thank you enough for your wisdom, early support, and incredible friendship. To Sifu Steve Goericke and Coach John Buxton, who taught me how to act in spite of fear and fight like hell for what I believe, this book\u2014and my life\u2014is a product of your influence. Bless you both. The world\u2019s problems would be far fewer if young men had more mentors like the two of you. Last but not least, this book is dedicated to my parents, Donald and Frances Ferriss, who have guided me, encouraged me, loved me, and consoled me through it all. I love you more than words can express.
